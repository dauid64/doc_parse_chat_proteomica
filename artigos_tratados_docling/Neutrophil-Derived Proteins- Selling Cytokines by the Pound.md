## 1 . Introduction

Neutrophils  act  as  the  first  line  of  defense  against  invading bacteria and  other  microorganisms. Traditionally, mature  neutrophils  have  been considered to be terminally differentiated cells lacking the ability  to synthesize proteins. In  recent years, however, it has become  increasingly clear that this view is outdated. Studies conducted in a large number of laboratories have indeed shown that neutrophils not only synthesize numerous proteins  that directly participate in their effector functions, but that they can also produce a variety of pro- and antiinflammatory polypeptides. For instance, there now exists compelling evidence that neutrophils can release a number of cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and interferons, both i n vitro and i n vivo. Furthermore, these studies have demonstrated  that the interaction  of  neutrophils  with  a  given agonist not  only  results  in  a characteristic pattern  of  cytohne release, but  also that  this  response can be modulated by immunoregulatory cytokines such as interleukin-10 (IL10)  and interferon-y (IFN-7).  In view of the broad spectrum of biological activities  exerted by cytokines,  it can be reasonably  inferred that neutrophils not  only play  an  important  role  in  eliciting and sustaining inflammation, but may also significantly  contribute to the regulation of immune reactions. These considerations  alone make it clear that  the current conception of the roles played by  neutrophils in pathophysiological processes is  in dire need of being redefined.  It is  my purpose to summarize here the current knowledge on the production of cytokines by neutrophils in vitro and in viuo, particularly molecular regulation and other biological and pathophysiological aspects.

## II .  General Features of Cytokine Production by Neuhophils

Polymorphonuclear neutrophil granulocytes (PMNs) are the predominant infiltrating cell type present in the cellular phase of the acute inflammatory response, and therefore act as a first line of defense against invading bacteria and other microorganisms ( 1 ) . Although monocytes and lymphocytes are thought to represent a major source of  cytokines among blood cells (2), it is now evident that cytokines are generated by many other cell

types a s well, including neutrophils (3, 4). Most of the studies addressing neutrophil cytokine release have been conducted in zjitro, but the validity of  their findings has nonetheless often been confirmed i n uizjo, principally through  the  use  of  molecular biology  techniques  or  other  sensitive tipproaches  such :is immunohistochemistry ( IH) and in s i t u hybridization (ISH) ( 5 ) . Thus, the ability of neutrophils to generate cytokines points to new mechanisms by which PMNs, might influence multiple aspects of the inflammatory and immune responses. In view of the fact that neutrophils usually represent the first cell type to migrate toward iriflained tissue, and given that most neiitrophil responses are stimulus specific,  these cells might play  a  key  role  in  determining  (or at  least  influencing) the  evolution of subsequent host responses.

Table I lists the cytokines that, to date, have been shown to be released by PMNs in vitro, either constitutively or following  appropriate stimulation. At first glance, the ability of PMNs to produce such a variety of cytokines

readily suggests that these cells might regulate not only the inflammatory and immune responses, but also other processes, such as hematopoiesis, wound healing, angiogenesis, and  antiviral defense.  Several laboratories have  generated  convincing molecular  evidence  that  PMNs  can  express proinflammatory  cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a)  (6-8), IL-la, IL-lP (g-ll), and IL-12 (12, 13);  antiinflammatory  cytokines such as the IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA) ( 1 4 , 1 5 ) and transforming growth factor+ (TGF-P)(16-18);  chemokines  such  as  IL-8  (19, 20), growthrelated  gene  product-a  (GRO-a) (21, 22),  macrophage  inflammatory protein-la (MIP-la)  and MIP-lP (23-25),  and cytokine-induced neutrophi1 chemoattractants (CINCs) (26,27);  and other cytokines such as IFNa (28, 29), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor  (G-CSF) (30, 31), Fas ligand  FasL) (32,33),  CD30 ligand (CD3OL)  (34,35),  vascular endothelial ( growth factor (VEGF)  (36-38),  and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)  (39, 40). In addition, PMNs have been  reported, albeit in single instances, to express and/or  release  macrophage CSF (M-CSF), IL-3, GRO-P, interferon-y inducible protein-10 ( IP-lo),  monokine induced by IFN-y (MIG), TGF-a,  oncostatin (OSM),  neurotrophins, and other molecules;  these studies  therefore  await  further  confirmation (4, 5). Finally, conflicting data exist  in  the  literature  concerning  the  issue  of  whether  IL-6,  inonocyte chemotactic  protein-1  (MCP-l), granulocyte-macrophage CSF  (GMCSF), stem cell factor  (SCF),  and IFN-y expression can be induced in human neutrophils (4, 5).  In  any instance, the very fact that  neutrophils can synthesize, store, and release such a wide range of cytokines stresses the necessity to reconsider the general role of  PMNs in physiopathology.

Though the production of cytokines  by activated neutrophils is striking  in its diversity,  the extent to which neutrophils generate cytokines  is generally limited (at least i n uitro), especially when compared to the  scale of  this response in peripheral mononuclear cells (MNCs) (4, 41). In this respect, it must be emphasized that despite their generally lower synthetic capacity, granulocytes nevertheless  constitute  the  majority of  infiltrating cells  in inflamed  tissues,  and  may  therefore  represent  an  important  source  of cytokines under such conditions. Depending on the cytokine, neutrophils possess 10-20  times less RNA per cell than do monocytes or lymphocytes, and  synthesize  10- to  300-fold  less  cytokine  than  do  monocytes on  an individual  basis  (4,  5). It  follows  that  if  one  is  to  investigate whether neutrophils  produce  a given  cytokine  (or other protein), it  is  absolutely mandatory to work with highly purified PMN populations (&gt; 99.5%). It is also highly recommended to exclude the possibility of  a prestimulation of PMNs during their isolation procedures (42, 43), which may be driven, for instance, by contamination of reagents, solutions, or labware with trace levels of endotoxin (44), or by the use of inappropriate methods of erythro-

cyte lysis. In our experiments, as well as in those of others (45), more than 98% of freshly purified PMNs are usually  positive for CD62L, a niembranebound antigen that is rapidly released on neutrophil stimulation (46).  That indicates that the isolation procedures and hypotonic lysis do not stimulate our neutrophil preparations  to any significant extent. In addition, the use of  endotoxin-free serum and culture media, the verification of endotoxin levels in  all  solutions by  the Limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) assay, and checking whether  polymyxin  B  sulfate inhibits the  effects of  the stimuli under investigation (47) all represent some of the common measures taken to  keep  LPS  contamination under  control. Although sometimes tedious, these  routine  procedures  are very  helpful  to avoid  artifactual effects of some stimuli, especially because the latter have sometimes been reported in the literature, and are probably often at the root of controversial observations.

The production of individual cytokines by neutrophils  is  influenced to a great extent by the stimulatory conditions. The most widely used stimuli are bacterial LPS and cytokines,  but known inducers of cytokine  generation in  neutrophils belong also to other classes of  molecules, including chernotactic fiactors [ formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine  (fMLP),  leukotriene B4 (LTBJ, platelet-activating factor (PAF), and the complement coinponent C5a], neuropeptides (substance P),  phagocytic particles, and microorganisms such as fungi, viruses, and bacteria (5). n general, a given stimulus I not  only affects the  magnitude  and kinetics  of  cytokine release, but  also influences the pattern of production as well. We have focused most of our investigations on the  effects of  LPS, fMLP, TNF-a and Saccharomyces cerevisiue opsonizedwith IgG (Y-IgG)  (8,19,21).  his led to the realization T that  Y-IgG  appears  to  be  a potent  trigger  for  the  release  of  only  some proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-a,  IL-8, and GHO-a), whereas LPS and TNF-a induce both  proinflammatory and antiinflammatory (for example IL-1RA) cytokines (4, 5, 15).  In contrast, fMLP (and chemoattrxtants in general) seem to trigger only a small, transient release of  IL-8 and GROa, but apparently not that of any other cytokine ( 4 , 5). Similarly, IL-4 and IL-13 induce only IL-1RA (48, 49). Moreover, the production of cytokines by neutrophils can be a finely tuned process, as illustrated by the synthesis and release of  IL-12, IP-10, or MIG, which occur only if neutrophils  are costiinulated with at least two agonists. One such combination is the IFNy plus LPS tandem (22).

The induction of  a given cytokine production  in  PMNs is  usually prcceded by an increased accumulation of the related inRNA transcripts. This can  be  detected  by  performing  classical  Northern  blot  analyses,  or, in ribonuclease protection assays (KPAs),  by reverse transcriptasepolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)  or by in situ hybridization. Northern

blotting  or  RPAs  have  the  advantage of  making differences  in  cytokine mRNA expression readily visible, and when  coupled with  densitometric analysis or phosphorimaging, these  approaches  can  be  semiquantitative. In  addition, the  use of  Northern  blotting and of  related  techniques  can yield important insights  into the molecular mechanisms regulating cytokine gene expression in PMNs. Although quantitative RT-PCR  is also possible, the exteme sensitivity of this technique entails the risk of amplifymg cytokine mRNA from very few (&lt; 0.5%) ontaminating monocytes,  lymphocytes, c or  eosinophils  (50). From  a  general  point  of  view,  however,  Northern blotting, RPAs, and especially RT-PCR  must be performed with adequate controls to avoid false positive results deriving from  contaminating cells. To illustrate  the  necessity to  carry out  such  controls, suffice it  to  recall that monocytes and lymphocytes possess 10-20  times more RNA per cell than do neutrophils; thus, contamination of a neutrophil preparation with only 1%  onocytes can easily translate into a total RNA preparation conm taining 20-25%  monocyte-derived RNA. Based on reports from our group (8)  as  well as from other laboratories (51,52), the presence of contaminating monocyte mRNA  in  Northern  analyses can  be  assessed by  using  IL-6 cDNA as a  probe.  The  combined  absence  of  detectable  IL-6  mRNA therefore indicates, in my opinion, that a given PMN population must be reasonably  free from contaminating monocytes. Similarly,  RANTES cDNA can be used to monitor eosinophil  contamination (our  unpublished observations).

Finally, the production  of  cytokines by  neutrophils  can be  modulated by immunomodulatory cytolanes such as  IFN-y, IL-10, IL-4, and IL-13, raising  the  possibility that  T helper  type  1 (Thl) and Th2  lymphocytes (53)  may selectively influence the production of cytokines by PMNs. Interestingly, depending on the stimulus used, the effects of  these regulatory cytokines are different. For example, IFN-y potentiates  the late release of  IL-8 or GRO-a by LPS-stimulated PMNs, but inhibits that induced by Y-IgG or fMLP ( 4 ) . Similarly, IL-10 enhances the production  of  IL-1RA by  LPS-stimulated PMNs, but does not influence that induced by Y-IgG or fMLP. Finally, though IL-10 inhibits the production of GRO-a in LPSstimulated PMNs, it enhances it in response to TNF-a (21).  A condensed description on the experimental conditions used to induce the production of the various cytokines  by neutrophils in vitro follows  below. Not included in this review is eosinophil- and basophil-derived cytokine production.

## A.  CHEMOKINES

Chemokines represent a group of chemotactic cytokines whose importance in inflammatory  processes is best illustrated by their ability to specifi-

cally recruit discrete leukocyte populations. These polypeptides are usually small, with molecular masses in the range of 8 to 12 kDa, and they share 20 to 70% homology in  amino acid sequences (54-56). Chemokines have been  classified into  four  closely related  subfamilies on  the  basis  of  the relative positions of  the first two cysteine residues, but only two of  these subfamilies have been extensively characterized: the 'C-X-C' and the 'C-C' chemokines (54-56). The C-X-C subfamily includes IL-8 (the  prototype), GHO-a, GRO-P, GHO-y, epithelial cell-derived and neutrophil-activating 78-amino acid peptide (ENA-78), MI€'-2,  CINC, IFN-y-inducible protein of 10 kDa (I€'-lo), MIG, and  others; these  chemokines predominantly exert stitnulatory and  chemotactic  activities toward neutrophils (54-57). The C-C subfamily  includes  monocyte  chemotactic  proteins, MIP-la, MIP-1P,  MIP-ly, arid  HANTES; these  chemokines  are  predominantly chemotactic for monocytes, eosinophils, basophils, and certain T lymphocyte subsets ( 5 7 ) . Two additional molecules, which are likely members of novel groups of chernokines, the C and CX,C subfamilies, have also been identified (54-57). To the former belongs lymphotactin, a potent attractant for lymphocytes, whereas to the latter belongs fractalkine or neurotactin, which is an integral membrane protein with a chemokinc domain ' 1 . t its N terminus (54-56). It has become quite obvious that chemokines and their receptors are expressed by  a wide variety of  nonhetnatopoietic  cells, and that  chemokine  Functions extend well beyond  leukocyte physiology. For instance, the  connections among chemokines, their  receptors, and  HIV infection broaden  the  previously  narrow  focus  on  chemokincs a s inerc chemoattractants (58).

Among the cell types that generate chemokines, neutrophils have been convincingly  and repeatedly shown to secrete both C-X-C and C-C chemokines.

## 1. C-X-C Chenwkines

- Interleulan-8 is  a key  mediator  for the  recruitment of  circulating  neutrophils.  This  chemokine  is  expressed  in  r(~sponse  o t inflammatory stimuli, and is secreted by a variety of  cell types, including lymphocytes, epithelial  cells,  keratinocytes, fibroblasts, endothclial  cells (ECs), smooth muscle cells ( 5 7 ) , and neutrophils.  In the latter instanccl, IL-8 is one of the most abundantly secreted (and most extensively studied) cytokines produced by neutrophils. Conversely, neutrophils represent tlw primary cellular  target  for  IL-8,  to  which  they  respond  by  chemotaxis, release of  granule enzymes, respiratory burst, up-regulation  of CR 1 and CD11/CD18 srirface expression, increased adherence to unstiinulated endothelial  cells,  and  transmigration  across  the  endothelium  (57). Other biological  properties  of  IL-8  include  its  chemotactic  activity  toward  T a. Zriterleukin-8.

lymphocytes, albeit less potently than in the case of  neutrophils  (57),  the stimulation of histamine release from basophils, and the ability to promote angiogenesis (59).

Subsequent to the early demonstrations that PMNs can release relevant amounts of biologically  active 11,-8 into culture supematants after phagocytosis of Y-IgG  (29),  or after stimulation with LPS (19, 20), a large number of studies followed and extended these seminal findings. Strieter and colleagues (20) showed  that  PMNs  (&gt;99% pure,  plated  at S X loh ml) expressed significant  steady-state levels of IL-8 mRNA after 4 hr of stimulation  with  LPS  (100 ng/ml), and  released  about  100 p g / d   of  IL-8  into culture  supernatants after 24 hr.  We  obtained  very  similar  results  with LPS (1  pg/ml), and further showed that phagocytosis of Y-IgG represented a  much  more  potent  stimulus  for  the  extracellular production  of  IL-8 release (from 10  to SO ng/ml/lti hr 10' PMN) (19).  In addition, we provided clear molecular and immunological evidence that  the  IL-8 recovered  in the  PMN cultures was not  due to contaminating monocytes, and that  it was biologically active (1 ). 9

It soon emerged that fMLP (60-64), as well as other neutrophil chemotactic factors such as CSa (60, 65),  PAF (GO), and LTB4  (66),  triggered the release of substantial amounts of IL-8 in PMNs. Chemoattractant-elicited IL-8 production was shown to be preceded by an enhanced expression of IL-8  mRNA,  and  to  be  dependent  on de nova protein  synthesis  (60). Optimal release of IL-8  was observed using 10  nM of fMLP (a  concentration that fails to stimulate a respiratory burst under the experimental conditions used), and  was  potentiated  from  two-  to  sixfold  if  PMNs  were  briefly pretreated  with  cytochalasin 13 (60). Furthermore,  secretion  of  IL-8  in response to fMLP was found to be transient, because inaxirnal production was  observed by 2-3 hr and returned to basal levels thereafter (20, 64), contrary to the sustained release of IL-8 induced by Y-IgG  or LPS (19). It is  therefore possible that IL-8, once produced in  response to fMLP, is taken  up by  cell surface receptors or is  degraded  by proteolytic enzymes simultaneously  released by PMNs (67).  However, a more likely explanation might stem from the fact that fMLP induces the release of neither IL-lP nor TNF-a, two cytokines that have been shown to amplify the release of IL-8 from LPS-treated neutrophils in an autocrine/paracrine  manner ( 4 ) . In contrast to the above findings, other investigators failed to observe any significant extracellular antigenic IL-8 (relative to unstimulated  controls) in  neutrophils  stimulated  with  graded  concentrations  of  CSa, fMLP, or LTB,  (68).  Similar results were also reported when fMLP and PAF were used  at  doses  higher  than  10-100 nM  (69). In  the  latter  two  studies, however, it  must  be  pointed  out  that  extracellular IL-8  was  measured in  supernatants harvested 24 hr  poststimulation; as  explained above, the

24-hr time point is  far from optimal to detect  IL-8 in  supernatants froin fMLP-stimulated PMNs (60).  Nevertheless, Strieter et al. (68) reported that  if  neutrophils were exposed to chemotactic agonists in  the presence of  LPS, the production  of  IL-8 was synergistically elevated. The fact that chemotactic factors for neutrophils can induce the production  of  another cheinoattractant ( i t . ,   IL-8) is intriguing. IL-8 production induced by cheinotactic f'actors  could represent  a feedback mechanism whereby greater nunibers of PMNs are attracted to an inflammatory  site, ensuring a persistent influx of  PMNs that perpetuate the inflammatory reaction.

The  release  of  IL-8  induced  by  LPS  can  be  inhibited  by  FUT-175 (a protease  inhibitor) (70), and  by  3-morpholinosydnoniinine  (SIN-1) (a combined nitric oxide-superoxide  donor) (71 ), but is additively enhanced either by  1, 2, 3, 4-oxatriazolium S-amino chloride  (GEA-3162) (a nitric oxide donor) (71), or by  a combination of SNP and NAC. Similarly, IL-8 secretion can be enhanced by  S-nitrosoglutathione, but not by dibutyrylcGMP (72). The  latter  results  have  important  implications for  patients with acute lung injury, who are coininonly  treated with inhaled nitric oxide, because enhanced production  of  neutrophil-derived  IL-8 may  represent a novel way  by which  nitric oxide could regulate  chemotactic  responses. The production of IL-8 induced by LPS is also potentiated by PMN binding to solid-phase fibrinogen (73), but not to plastic surfaces precoated  either with  fibronectin  (Fn), a ligand  of  the  integrin  receptor aSp1, or  with larninin (Ln), a ligand of  the integrin  receptor a6Pl  (74). Interestingly, under the latter conditions, untreated  PMNs released high levels of  IL-8 compared to cells adhered  to plastic (74). It is  noteworthy that  although most of  the  studies described  above were performed  using  LPS derived from Esclicrichim coli, other LPS serotypes have been shown to stiinulate PMNs to release IL-8. For instance, endotoxins from pathogenic bacteria of  periodontitis  lesions  (such  as Actinobncillus uctinoiiiyceteiiLconiituiu, Fusobnctcriuin nucleatuin, and, to lesser extent, Poryhyroinmius gingivulis and Cnpnocytophngn ochrncen) have been reported to promote IL-8 secretion (7ij). The effect of P. girigivalis was preceded by a stimulation of  NFKBand  AP-1  -binding activities (76), in  keeping with  the  ability of  this bacterium  to concurrently induce the production  of  IL-1 and TNF-a in neutrophils (75).

LPS,  Y-IgG phagocytosis,  and chemotactic factors are not the only stimuli that induce the production of IL-8 by neutrophils. TNF-a is another agent that stimulates IL-8 mRNA and secretion in a time- and dose-dependent manner (2,5,  68, 77, 78), at much higher levels than IL-1p (79, 80).  However, IL-10 drainatically synergizes with TNF-a, if used at the same concentrations produced by neutrophils in response to LPS (79). Other studies identified GM-CSF as a very potent inducer of IL-8 by human PMNs (25,

81-83),  and this activity  of GM-CSF is potentiated by the immunosuppressive drugs, cyclosporin A  (CsA) and  rapamycin, but  not  by  FK506 (84). Some investigators have reported  that  IL-2 (83, 85, 86), IL-13 (87), and TGF-P (88)  induce IL-8 mRNA expression and secretion by PMNs, but others  found these cytokines to be  ineffective (see 89, 90,  for  IL-2; 50, for IL-13; 51, for TGF-P).  In contrast, there is no doubt that IL-15 induces IL-8  mRNA expression and  secretion by  neutrophils  (86, 90), as  it  also does in monocytes (91).  IL-15 is a recently discovered cytokine produced by a wide range of different cell types including fibroblasts, keratinocytes, endothelial cells, and  macrophages in  response  to  lipopolysaccharide or microbial infection (92). IL-15 has been shown to act on various cells of the immune system, including T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, NK cells, and, more recently, peripheral blood neutrophils (89).  In PMNs IL-15 was observed to induce cytoskeletal rearrangements, to enhance phagocytosis, to increase the synthesis  of several cellular proteins, and to delay apoptosis (89).  Under identical conditions, however, IL-2 failed to affect any of these responses in  neutrophils  (89).

The range of stimuli shown to induce the production of  IL-8 by PMNs covers many more biological agents and continues to expand (Table 11). For  example, the  inflammatory microcrystals monosodium urate  (MSU) and calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD),  which are major mediators of  gout and pseudogout, respectively, both increase the secretion of IL-8 by neutrophils, yet have no effect on that of  MIP-la (25). Interestingly, the presence of  MSU  and CPPD synergistically enhances the production of  IL-8  induced  by  TNF-a  and  GM-CSF,  but  completely  inhibits  the secretion of MIP-la induced by TNF-a (25).  PMNs stimulated with phorbol  myristate  acetate  (PMA) (61,  78,  93), staurosporine  (a nonspecific inhibitor  protein  kinase  C  and  of  other  kinases)  (93), thapsigargin  (an inhibitor of the endoplasmic Ca'+-sequestering ATPase) (94), and A23187 (61, 63, 69) and  ionomycin  (94) (two calcium  ionophores)  express high levels  of  IL-8  inRNA  and  release  IL-8  in  a  time-  and  dose-dependent manner.  IL-8 production  induced  by  A23187 is  partially  inhibited  by  a selective PAF antagonist (69),  in keeping with the known ability of A23187 to stimulate the synthesis of PAF in neutrophils (95).  That PAF receptor antagonists can inhibit IL-8 release from neutrophils has been confirmed in  another recent  study (96).

Substance  P, one  of  the  main  mediators  of  neurogenic  inflammation, not only directly stimulates the release of  IL-8 from human  neutrophils, but also enhances the effect of TNF-a and fMLP (97). Human or bovine lactoferrin (LF),  iron-glycoproteins having fundamental antimicrobial activities, and lactoferricin (LFcin),  a peptide derived from the  N-terminal region  of  LF,  all  have  been  shown  to  stimulate  the  release  IL-8  from

human neutrophils (98).  Interestingly, protamine, a basic peptide, exerted the  same effect  as that  of  LF and LFcin, suggesting the  importance of the  basic  nature  of  LF and  LFcin  in  mediating  this  stimulatory activity (98). Thrombopoietin, which  regulates  early  and  late  stages  of  platelet formation as well as platelet activation,  is yet another molecule that is able stimulate a sustained release of IL-8 from human neutrophils (64). Whereas sulfatides, which  are  established  ligands for  L-selectin,  up-regulate  the accumulation of  IL-8 transcripts in neutrophils (99),  ligation of  P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-  I) (loo), or ICAM-3 (101), by immobilized antibodies to the plastic, triggers the release of IL-8 from neutrophils. Even reverse signaling  via CD3OL  was demonstrated to induce the production of IL-8 by freshly  isolated  neutrophils (35). his phenomenon was obtained by T cross-linking CDSOL with specific monoclonal antibodies or by CD30-Fc fusion protein (35). Indirect effects through CD30 were clearly ruled out, because neutrophils do not express this surface molecule (34, 35).

I have already mentioned that Y-IgG represents one of the most potent stimuli of  IL-8 secretion  by  neutrophils  (19).  Similarly, coincubation  of PMNs with zymosan (a yeast cell wall extract) (69), heat-killed Candida albicans (83, 86), or MP-F2, another candidial product (102), also results in the  appearance  of  significant  quantities  of  immunoreactive  IL-8  in culture supernatants of neutrophils. Although opsonization  is not a prerequisite for the release of  IL-8 under these conditions (45, 69, 103, 104), it does enhance the efficiency of  stimulation (61, 103). Evidence that  the release  of  IL-8  by  neutrophils  stimulated  by  zymosan  is  dependent  on a  CDllb/CD18 signaling pathway  has  also been  provided  (69). Other observations have revealed that two structurally distinct PAF antagonists suppressed zymosan-induced neutrophil IL-8 generation by approximately 70% (69).  Similarly,  CAMP-elevating  agents proved to be effective negative modulators of  IL-8 generation  in  zymosan-activated human  neutrophils, mainly because they inhibited zymosan ingestion (104). Because IL-8 generation induced by LPS was  shown to be unaffected by exogenous PGE2 (105), the data suggest that, depending on the activating stimuli, CAMPelevating agents differentially modulate the ability of  neutrophils to produce IL-8.

Neutrophils secrete copious amounts of IL-8 after phagocytosis of Listeria monocytogenes and Yersiriia enterocolitica, and this is further potentiated  by  GM-CSF  (106). Interestingly,  a  noninvasive L.  inonocytogenes strain was also found to be phagocytosed, and to induce high levels of IL8 release  by  PMNs, whereas  the  most  important virulence  factor  of L. monocytogenes, listeriolysin 0, was ineffective (106).  Secretion of IL-8 by PMNs occurs in  response  to stimulation with Cyptococms neoformans yeast cells,  or with glucuronoxylomannan  (GXM),  the major C.  neof0rman.s

capsular polysaccharide (1 07), Streptococcus pyogeiies ( 1 08), and Pklsniodium ~ilciparr~ni-infected  ythrocytes (109).  Production er of IL-8 also occurs after treatment  of  PMNs with various bacterial toxins: the  PantonValentine  leukocidin  (Luk-PV,  from Stciphylococms  nzireus V8)  and alveolysin ( A h ,  from Bncilkis  uluei), two  pore-forming  toxins, as  well  as the erythrogenic toxin A (ETA, from Streptococcrcs pyogenes) (1 10). I Iowever, IL-8 release occurred only when the toxins were used at low concentrations ( 0 . 5 - 5 ng/lO'  cells) (110).  Different pathways mediate the generation  and  release  of  IL-8 induced  by  these  toxins, because  inhibitors  of protein tyrosine kinases reduced the release and the inHNA expression of IL-8 in PMNs challenged with Luk-PV and Ah, but not with ETA (110). Borreliu hurgtk)feri outer  surface protein A (OspA), but  not  the  unlipidated recombinant OspA, has been shown to represent a potent stimulant of neutrophil activities,  including the secretion of IL-8 (62)  (the  spirochete B.  hurgclorferi is  the  etiologic agent  of  Lyine  disease). Furthermore,  a purified capsular polysaccharide complex (CPC)  from Bncteroidcs frtigilis, an  anaerobic  pathogen  that  accounts for the  majority  of  infections that occur within the peritoneal cavity, yielded high  levels of  1L-8 production by PMNs, with a response more robust than, and tilne-dependently different from, that observed in autologous PBMCs (111).  Finally, ii very lowmolecular-weight  1  kDa) product of ( Pseuclonwnns cieniginosu was shown to induce the expression  of IL-8 inHNA in neutrophils ( I 12).  In this regard, clinical P. nerugiriosn isolates, the  inucoid P. neruginosa strain  (CFSM) and  its  nonmucoid  revertant  (CF3),  and  purified P. aeruginosu Inucoitl exopolysaccharide (alginate) were  all  shown  to produce ii significant increase in  IL-8  release by  human  PMNs, in a dose- and time-dependent manner (I 13, 114). Stimulation of neutrophils with  fonnalin-killed strain P. nerngiiiosci 5276 induced levels of I L-8 production that were inore than 10 times  higher  than  those  induced  by  LPS  or  IL-lP, after  the  same stimulation  time (24 hr)  (115).   moderate inhibitory  effect of erythromycin A (115) or  erythromycin  derivatives  (116) on  the  production  of  IL-8  by forinalin-killed  PseutEoi,2onas-stimulated  neutrophils was also reported. In this respect, it  is  important to note  that  treatment  with  erythromycin of patients with  chronic  airway disease (CAD) and persistent P. ueniginosti infection  causes  significant  reductions  of  the  inflammatory parameters in  hronclioalveolar lavage (BAL) fluids from these patients (1 15).  Taken together, these observations have significant implications in the context of cystic fibrosis (CF),  because they not only attribute an important role for PMN-derived IL-8 in  maintaining neutrophil  influx, but provide a better understanding of  the mechanisms by which P. nenigiiiosci bacteria determine the clinical outcome of  C F  and other diseases.

Other microorganisms promote the release of  IL-8 by  human  PMNs. For instance, exposure of  human neutrophils to Salmonella typhimurium and  S. aureus strongly induced  IL-8  (and  MIP-la) secretion, whereas Streptococcus pneuinoniae and Staphylococcus epidermidis were less potent  (114). Coincubation of  neutrophils with TNF-a and all of the above microorganisms led to a significant enhancement of the induction  of  IL8. PMNs stimulated  with Mycobacteriuin  tuberculosis, or  with  a  major mycobacterial cell  wall  component,  lipoarabinomannan  (LAM), release both  IL-8 and  GRO-a  (117). Release of  IL-8 critically depends  on  the PMN: M. tuberculosis ratio,  a  1  1 ratio  being  the  optimal  ratio  (117). : These findings have been confirmed and extended with the demonstration that, in response to heat-killed M. tuberculosis and protein-purified derivatives (PPDs),  neutrophils produce MIP-la, but not MCP-1 (80),  and that under those conditions, the release of IL-8 (but not that of MIP-la) was potentiated by TNF-a (80).

Some viruses  have  been  found  to  induce  the  production  of  IL-8  by PMNs. One example is the respiratory syncytd virus (RSV), which provokes in  neutrophils  an enhancement  of  IL-8 mRNA steady-state levels, accompanied  by  the  secretion  of  IL-8,  in  a  time-  and  dose-dependent manner (118).  IL-8 synthesis depended on the adherence of viral particles and  the  subsequent  phagocytic event, but  not  on  the  infection process. Indeed, stimulation of human PMNs with viable, heat-inactivated or UVinactivated RSV induced IL-8 production (protein plus mRNA) to a similar degree  (61, 118).  Stimulation  of  human  PMNs  with  purified  RSV  Gprotein, a major capsid protein, resulted in an increased IL-8 release from human  PMNs, but  to a significantly lesser degree compared with  intact RSV (118).  hen RSV particles were opsonized with mAbs directed to the W RSV fusion protein ( F  rotein),  the release of IL-8 from PMNs increased in p comparison with RSV alone, and this increase occurred without a concomitant enhancement of IL-8 mRNA levels (61, 118).  These results are highly reminiscent of  those  obtained  by  using yeast particles  (Y)  and Y-IgG as stimuli  (103). In  spite  of  an  equivalent  increase  of  IL-8  mRNA  levels induced by both Y-IgG and Y, Y-IgG was more potent than Y in inducing the release of IL-8 (103).  Engagement of the Fcy-receptors might play a role  in  enhancing  the  synthesis and/or  rate  of  the de novo-synthesized cytoplasmic IL-8 pool.

Epstein-Barr  Virus (EBV), the etiologic  agent of infectious mononucleosis and other diseases, also leads to an increased accumulation of mRNA encoding IL-8 and MIP-la in neutrophils, and to a time-dependent production of the chemokines,  with a maximum after 24 hr (1 9).  This response 1 was dependent on the interaction between  the glycoprotein gp350 of the viral envelope and the neutrophil surface and not due to viral replication

or  the  synthesis of  one  or  niort' intermediate  proteins (119). The  IL-8 produced under these conditions was biologically active, a s deterinined in a calcium mobilization assay. Pretreatment  of neutrophils with  CM-CSF resulted in a significantly greater proportion of the newly synthesized IL8 being secreted (approximately  41% versus less than 10%) (120). Because both  IL-8 antl MIP-la are chetnoattractants  for T cells and for T and  R cells, respectively,  the ability of ERV to induce their production by neutrophils may enhance the ability of  this virus to infect R antl T lymphocytes via  increased recruitment to sites of  infection. In addition, the release of these chemokines combined with the ability of  EBV to alter  the  ratio of IL-1HA/IL-1 in favor of immunosuppression (121) inay he related  to the infectivity of  the virus in vioo.

Finally, the presence of  IL-8 tnRNA in most samples of freshly isolated neutrophils has been repeatedly observed (60, 61, 68, 78,83, 113). Usually, these constitutivcl IL-8 transcripts are almost completely phased oiit within a fcw hours of culture in the absence of  stimulation (60). Although it was reported that adherence to plastic induces nrutrophils  and monocytes to secrete 11,-8 (61, 122), we  (60)  and  others ( 8 2 ) c l i d not  find  substantiill differences in culturing  neutrophils under adherent (polystyrene)  or nonadherent (polypropylene)  conditions. Despite the presence of specific tnRNA, the secretion of 11,-8 by unstiinulated cultured human neutrophils is always very low (below 1 O O pghil),  unless  the cells have been inadvertently preactivated by the isolation procedures. This constitutive IL-8 inRNA may either result from mechanical stress during cell preparation or represent a constitutive RNA pool that facilitates the rapid appearance of the mature protein on PMN stiiriulation.  Evidence for the latter possibility is that the constitutive presence  of  TNF-a inHNA or  IL-IP niRNA (60) in freshly isolated PMNs is much more variable compared to that of IL-8 niRNA. Nevet-theless, it  cannot  be  excluded that  cell separation procedures might weakly induce  IL-8 but  not TNF-a or IL-1P inHNA expression (35).

h. Growth-Kcdntrrl Gcrw  Prothtct-a, GKO-P,  and Related Chtwiokiiics. IL-8 is not the only C-X-C cheinokine with  neutrophil-activating properties that is secreted by human PMNs. Indeed, our studies revealrtl that  activated PMN5 ~ a i i   so  release al CKO-a ( 2 1 ) in  amounts  and  with kinetics  that  vary  depending on  the  agonist. Previous work  showed that PMNs that  adhercd  for  4 F j   min  to  fibronectin-coated  plastic  expressed selectively CJHO-a mHNA, whereas inonocytes from the saiiie individiials expressed all  three  GI30 isoforins (CHO-a, GKO-P, and GRO-y) (123). However, only  RT-PCH  analysis was  utilized in thut  study (123). In  our hands,  phagocytosis of  Y-IgG  caused  only  a  moderatc GHO-a mKNA accuiniilation ( a s compared to LPS, TNF-a, or fMLI'), but it was approxi-

mately two-  to  threefold  more  potent  than  LPS,  and  much  more  than TNF-a, in inducing the production of  GRO-a (21).  Very small quantities of GRO-a protein were detected in culture supernatants of PMNs stimulated with fMLP, in spite of a very high  accumulation of GRO-a mRNA transcripts (comparable to that iduced by  LPS) (21).  It is therefore possible that, as was  observed in the case of Y-IgG-stimulated IL-8 release (124), GRO-a production in Y-IgG-treated PMNs is controlled at the translational or posttranslational level. By contrast, in monocytes, LPS was more potent than Y-IgG and TNF-a,  indicating  that the regulation of GRO-a production is  governed by distinct mechanisms depending on the cell type (21).

Other studies have confirmed the ability of neutrophils to produce GROa. In  one  study,  PMNs  obtained  from  peripheral  blood  (PB) or  from reumathoid arthritis synovial  fluids (HA  SF)  were compared for their ability to generate  GRO-a. After culture for 24hr, both  RA  SF PMNs and PB PMNs constitutively  produced very high levels of GROa, and this production was slightly increased on stimulation with LPS (22). In another work, neutrophils were stimulated for up to 12 hr with TNF-a, GM-CSF, MSU, and CPPD, used either individually or in combination, and the levels of GRO-a in  the culture supernatants were then assessed (25). Low levels of GRO-a were detected in supernatants from both control and stimulated cells, regardless of the triggering conditions (25).  Although the number of PM Ns used in these experiments  were not specified,  the quantitative results shown with TNF-a were in the order of picograins per milliliter, as in our case (25).  Similarly, neutrophils  treated  with thapsigargin were  found to release  higher  levels  of  GRO-a  compared  to  untreated  cells,  but  this increase was not statistically significant (94).

More recently, evidence  that  PMNs  activated with M. tuberculosis or LAM  release GRO-a has been clearly provided (117). LAM  produced a concentration-dependent increase of GRO-a release by PM Ns, whereas M. tuberculosis stimulated a 12-fold increase of GRO-a levels into neutrophil supernatants (11  7). Furthermore, though  polymixin  B  did  not  influence GRO-a or IL-8  production, treatment of neutrophils with an LTB4  inhibitor prior to stimulation with M. tuberculosis or LAM partially blocked GROa and IL-8 secretion (117).  This suggests that the 5-lipooxygenase  pathway is  involved in  the signal transduction  cascade induced by M. tuberculosis and LAM to induce IL-8 and GRO-a. Based on their findings, the authors concluded that  PMNs, through the generation of  GRO-a and IL-8, may contribute to the early host  response  against M. tuberculosis, increasing local inflammation and recruiting more phagocytes to the site of  injury.

The ability of PMNs to produce GRO-a is relevant for several reasons. For instance, among its various biological activities, GRO-a has mitogenic effects on normal and transformed human rnelanocyte cell lines (125), and

this raises the possibility that  neutrophil-derived GRO-a may play a role in  melanocyte transformation. Like IL-8, GRO-a also acts as a mediator of  inflammation, in  that  it  exerts  powerful  chemotactic  and  activatory properties toward PMNs, including degranulation, increased expression of adhesion  molecules, and in  uivo recruitment  of  neutrophils  to  sites  of injection (54, 57). Thus, the generation of GRO-a by neutrophils, in addition  to that  of  IL-8,  may  stimulate the recruitment of  neutrophils  to inflammatory sites and their subsequent activation.  In this respect, one study (126) has shown that the concentrations of GRO-a and IL-8 were markedly elevated in BAL fluids  of three acute pathologic  states:  bacterial pneumonia (BPN), adult  respiratory  distress  syndrome  (ARDS), and Pneunuqstis cnrinii pneumonia (PCP). The levels of these two chemokines were basically undetectable in  16 subjects of control group, but much higher in the ARDS and BPN groups than in PCP group (126). Interestingly, the levels of GRO-a were biologically active and consistently higher than the levels of IL-8. GRO-a or IL-8 levels both correlated with the absolute neutrophil number per milliliter when all groups were studied, again suggesting that GRO-a could be as important as IL-8 in acute lung inflammatory process (126). Although this study did not establish the precise cellular source of GRO-a and IL-8 in the alveoli,  the results emphasize that in addition to IL8,  other neutrophil-derived chemokines such as GRO-a can be produced at high concentrations and are likely to act in concert with IL-8 in the lung.

Human PMNs also express basal levels of GRO-P mRNA that increase up to  10-fold on  stimulation with  LPS  for  24  hr (127). In  monocytes, the  same treatment  results in  a more  than  100-fold increase  of GRO-P transcripts (127). Because of  the lack of available specific immunological assays to measure this chemokine, there exists only little information on GRO-P secretion by leukocytes. In contrast, the neutrophil expression of the  various  GRO proteins  has  been  investigated  in  other  species.  For instance, rat peritoneal  neutrophils harvested  16 hr after casein injection and incubated  with  staurosporine  and  PMA were  shown to accumulate, in  a time-dependent  manner, high  levels of  CINC-3IMIP-2 mRNA  and release  significant  levels  of  CINC-1,  CINC-2a,  and  CINC-3,  but  not CINC-2P (27). It  should  be  pointed  out  here  that  on  the  basis  of  the similarities of  amino acid  sequences, CINCs are the  rat  counterparts  of the human GRO proteins (128). CINC-S/MIP-S was actually the chemokine  most  abundantly produced  and was  biologically active (27). mRNA accumulation and production of staurosporine- and PMA-induced CINCs were down-regulated by  the protein  kinase C inhibitors, H-7, calphostin C, and  Ro 31-8425, and by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, genistein  (27). These data corroborate our previous findings on the ability of staurosporiric and PMA to directly induce IL-8 production by  human neutrophils (93).

The ability of  rat  neutrophils  and  macrophages to  produce  CINCs  and MIP-la after phagocytosis of heat-killed yeast cells in vitro was assessed in  another  study (129). Neutrophils  produced  considerable  amounts  of CINC-2 and MIP-la, but very low quantities of CINC-3 and no CINC1 (129). In  contrast,  macrophages  produced  high  amounts  of  CINC-3 and MIP-la, and considerable levels CINC-1 and CINC-2. Accordingly, supernatants  collected  from  phagocytosing  rat  neutrophils  and  macrophages possessed chemotactic  activities toward  neutrophils,  which  were markedly inhibited by anti-CINCs or anti-MIP-la antibodies (129). Furthermore, dexamethasone suppressed the production of CINC-2 and MIPla,  due to its ability to inhibit the phagocytic process (129). Finally, the capacity  of PMNs and macrophages  to express CINC and other chemokines after  adherence in  vitro and exposure to endotoxin was  assessed by  Wu and colleagues (26). PMNs were obtained  from the peritoneal  cavity of rats previously  injected with glycogen. PMNs expressed mRNA for CINC, MIP-2,  MIP-la,  MIP-1P,  and  MCP-1,  either  after  adherence  or with endotoxin stimulation at levels higher than  macrophages (26).

c.  Interferon-y-Inducible  Protein-10, Monokine Induced by IFN-  y ,   and Interferon-Inducible T Cell a Chenwattractant. The C-X-C chemokines can be further subdivided into two classes, depending on the presence of the glutamate-leucine-arginine (ELR) motif preceding the first two cysteines (54-56). IL-8, GRO, and other members express this motif and predominantly exert stiinulatory and chemotactic activities toward neutrophils (54-56). In contrast, platelet factor 4 (PF-4),  stronial-derived factor (SDF), IP-10, MIG, and the recently cloned interferon-inducible T cell a chemoattractant (I-TAC) (130) lack the ELR sequence (130, 131). Based on their structure  and  function,  MIG,  IP-10,  and  I-TAC  consist  of  three  very closely related chemokines that act mainly on T lympocytes and NK cells (130-132). MIG, I-TAC, and IP-10 are usually strongly induced by IFN-y in a  range of cell  types,  including  monocytes,  keratinocytes,  endothelial cells, and  astrocytes (130-132). Though  the  receptors  for the  C-X-C chemokines containing the ELR motif are expressed on different types of leukocytes, there  is  thus  far only a single receptor, CXCRS, that  is  known  to bind  MIG, I-TAC, and IP-10 (130, 131, 133). Importantly, CXCR3 (and CCR5) seem to be preferentially expressed on activated T lymphocytes of the  T  helper  type  1  phenotype (134-137). Studies in  vitro have  shown that  MIG and IP-10 are also active as  inhibitors of  colony formation by hematopoietic cells (138,139). In vim, MIG and IP-10 inhibit neovascularization and exert antitumor effects in murine models (140-145).

We have observed that both IP-10 and MIG are produced and released by  human neutrophils (146, 147). We also found that I-TAC mRNA can

be  expressed in  neutrophils  under  specific stimulatory conditions (147). To our surprise, IFN-y alone exerts only a modest effect on IP-10, MIG, and I-TAC mHNA accumulation in neutrophils (146,147). However, stimulation  of  PMNs with  IFN-y in  combination with  either TNF-a or  LPS (but  not with Y-IgG, fMLP, IL-8, PMA, or G-CSF)  resulted in a considrable induction of  IP-10, MIG, and I-TAC mHNA transcripts, as well as in the extracellular release of  the  IP-10 and  MIG  proteins.  Though  IP-10 and MIG  production  in  IFN-y  treated  neutrophils  was  dependent  on  the concentration of  LPS or TNF-a, kinetics of cheinokine release in culture supernatants  were  different, in  the  sense that  IP-10 was  detected  after 4 hr, and MIG was measured only after 18-21  hr (146, 147). By contrast, IFN-y proved  to be  a very potent  stimulus for IP-10, MIG, and  I-TAC inHNA experession and IP-10 and MIG production by autologous PBMCs, suggesting  that the production of these cheinokines is controlled in different ways, dependmg on the cell type. Another striking difference between PBMCs and PMNs, was that costimulation of IFN-y-treated PBMCs with LPS led to a diminished  production  of  IP-10  and  MIG  with  respect  to PBMCs treated with IFN-y alone (146, 147). IL-10, and, less efficiently, IL-4, suppressed extracellular  production of IP-10 and MIG in neutrophils stiinulatedwith IFN-.)I lus LPS or TNF-a p (146,147). Finally,  in agreement with previous findings on monocytes (148), IFN-a alone induced only IP10 mHNA in neutrophils, whereas in  PBMCs it induced both  IP-10 and I-TAC mKNA (147). Iininunological assays on  IP-10 protein  release  revealed  that  IFN-a in  combination with  IFN-y,  LPS, TNF-a, or  IL-lP determined a considerable release of  antigenic IP-10 into the neutrophil supernatants (147).  The ability of PMNs to produce MIG, IP-10, and likely I-TAC niight  be  significant considering  the  various  biological  fimctions that  these three  chemokines exert. Generation  of  MIG, IP-10, and I-TAC by PMNs may, for instance, contribute to recruit Thl lymphocytes to sites of inflammation (134-137). The selective activity of  MIG, I-TAC, and IP10 on  activated T cells and prohalily NK cells is consistent with a role in regulating  the trafficking and/or function of effector cells during an imniune response. Because IFN-a, in addition to IL-12, IFN-.)I,  TGF-fl and hormones, has been reported to regulate Thl developinent (149), production of IP-10 by IFN-a-stiindated neutrophils may represent one of the niechariisins that contributes  to  Thl responses essential for clearance of pathogens such as viruses. Alternatively, neutrophil-derived  IP-10, MIG, or  I-TAC might negatively regulate hematopoiesis (138, 139), or, in  light of  to  the established angiostatic  properties of IP-10 and MIG (140-145), inay represent one of  the  mechanisms whereby these cells exert antitumor effects (150). Neiitrophils can in fact mediate tumor cell killing through direct or bystander effects, and can participate in the crosstalk with  CD8 T cells,

which is instrumental in the rejection of  specific cytokine-transduced tumors (151-153).

## 2. C-C Chemokines

MIP-la and MIP-IP  are  members  of  the  C-C  subfamily of  chemokines, which  also includes  MCP-2, MCP-3, 1-309mCA3, and RANTES (57). Data  from  a number  of  laboratories  suggest that  both  MIP-la  and  MIP-1P  are  expressed primarily in T cells, 13 cells, monocytes, neutrophils, and Langerhans cells stimulated with  antigens,  specific agonists, or  mitogens (154). MIP-la acts as a potent  chemotacticlactivating factor for monocytes and subpopulations of T and B lymphocytes and eosinophils, and also activates several effector  functions of  macrophages and  neutrophils,  such  as  the generation of hydrogen peroxide (57)  and the secretion of TNF-a, IL-la, and  IL-6 (154). MIP-la may be pyrogenic and might also be irnplicated in  negative regulation of  myelopoiesis, because it has suppressive activity on heinatopoietic stem cells and early subsets of hematopoietic progenitor cells,  both in  vitro and in  vivo (57, 154). A preferential  migration  of activated CD4'  and CD8+  T cells in response to MIP-la and MIP-1P has been  reported (155). a.  Mncrophnge ZnJlai?zmato y Protein-la and  MZP-1P.

The ability of  stimulated  neutrophils  to  secrete  MIP-la and  MIP-1P has  been  fully characterized  by  Kasama and co-workers (23, 24). It was initially  observed that cell-free supernatants from human PM Ns Stimulated with increasing concentrations of LPS possessed a chemotactic activity for human  monocytes; this activity was  significantly attenuated  (by approximately 60%) in the presence of neutralizing antihuman MIP-la antibodies. By Northern blot analysis, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and  immunocytochemistry, the  group  succeeded in  demonstrating  that LPS induces  mRNA expression and  extracellular production  of  MIP-la (23,) and  of  MJP-1P as  well (24). Though  GM-CSF, G-CSF, and  IL-3 failed by  themselves to induce the  expression of  MIP-la, stimulation of PMNs with  LPS  in  the  presence  of  GM-CSF  resulted  in  a  synergistic expression  of  both  MIP-la  mRNA  and  protein,  compared  with  LPS alone (23).

Other stimuli were subsequently shown to possess the ability to induce neutrophils to secrete MIP-la (25). For instance, MSU, CPPD, and GMCSF  were found to be ineffective,  whereas TNF-a significantly  up-regulaed MTP-la  mRNA expression and secretion (25). Secretion of  MIP-la induced by TNF-a was completely inhibited by the presence of either MSU or  CPPD, yet  the  production  of  IL-8  under  the  same  conditions  was synergistically  enhanced (25).  These results are of great relevance because they imply that the failure of inflammatory microcrystals to induce MIP-

la production directly, or to inhibit tlie release of  MIP-la in response to TNF-a, can  prevent  the  generation  of  neutrophil-derived  chemotactic signals that could attract inononuclear cells into the synovial enviornnient.

Exposure of huinan  neutropliils to  microorganisins represents another condition that triggers MIP-la mHNA and secretion in human neutrophils. This is  indeed the case for P. neruginosn, S. nureus, S. typhiimcriurn, S. piieunumine, and to a lesser extent, S. epidennidis, and C.  nlbicans (114). In contrast, Snccliciromyces cereuisicie and zymosan failed to induce M IPla release (114).  Production of  MIP-la induced by TNF-a was inhibited by the simultaneous treatment  with zymosan or S. cereuisine, whereas it was potentiated by S. typhimurium, P. neruginosa, or S. pneumoniae (1 4). 1 These  results  indicate  that  whereas  neutrophils  exposed to  some  micro organisms in the presence of TNF-a will produce both IL-8 and MIP-la, thus resulting in  generation of  signals for tlie  recruitment of neutrophils and inononuclear leukocytes,  respectively,  certain types of microorganisms can skew this response toward the synthesis of only IL-8.

MIP-la ( a s well as  IL-8 and CHO-a) is  also produced by neutrophils in response to heat-killed M. tuberculosis and PPD (go),  although at lower levels than after stimulation with  LPS (80).  The yields of  antigenic MIPla detected  in  neutrophils  stimulated  with M. tuberculosis or  PPD  in coinbination with TNF-a (or IL-lfi) did not differ froin those  measured after stimulation  with inycobacterial  derivatives  alone (80), despite a higher expression of MIP-la mRNA (80).  The reason for the discrepancy between MIP-la inRNA expression and MIP-la antigen release from neutrophils stimulated with M. tuberculosis or  PPD in  the presence  of  TNF-a was attributed to a reduction of  neutrophil viability induced  by TNF-a (80).

As  mentioned  previously, exposure of  neutrophils  to EBV leads to  an increased accumulation of MIP-la and IL-8 inRNA, followed by a tiinedependent  production  of  the related  antigenic molecule (11 ). EBV in9 creases the synthesis of MIP-la in neutrophils by about 176-fold,  approximately 87% of which is secreted (1 9).  Under similar conditions, only 1 27% of  the  total  IL-8 is  released  (119). Treatment  of  neutrophils  with  GMCSF before EBV activation enhances the production of both MIP-la and IL-8, without  modifying the levels of  their  mRNA compared with those obtained in  response to either GM-CSF or EBV alone (120).  The ability of  GM-CSF to potentiate the production  of  MIP-la by  EBV-stimulated neutrophils may enhance the ability ofthis virus to infect B and T lyinphocytes via  increased recruitment to sites of infection.

Also,  supernatants  from  rat  neutrophils  (and macrophages)  collected after phagocytosis of  heat-killed yeast cells were shown to display toward neutrophils chemotactic activities that were  markedly inhibited by  dexamethasone and anti-MIP-la  antibodies; these supernatants contained ele-

vated levels of  MIP-la (129). In neutrophils, the peak of  MIP-la release was observed after 5 hr of incubation, whereas MIP-la mRNA levels were still elevated at 24 hr (129). The lack of correspondence between  MIPla mRNA expression and MIP-la extracellular detection was ascribed to the  degradation  of  antigenic  MIP-la by  serine proteases  released  from neutrophils  during phagocytosis.  In  this  regard,  the  addition  of  several protease  inhibitors  (including phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride,  leupeptin, chymostatin, or antipain) to the 8-hr supernatants of neutrophils cultured with yeast cells and incubated for another 20 hr significantly inhibited the degradation  of  MIP-la occurring under these  conditions (129). Finally, increase  in  MIP-la and  MIP-1P  mRNA  expression in  rat  PMNs  after adherence in  vitro and  exposure to  endotoxin  to  levels  higher  than  in macrophages was also observed.

The ability of PMNs to secrete MIP-la, and MIP-1P is of considerable importance.  The fact that  neutrophils  produce  MIP-la and  MIP-1P (in addition  to  IL-8,  GRO-a,  IP-10,  MIG,  and  I-TAC) suggests that  once PMNs arrive at an inflammatory site, they not only promote the further recruitment  of  neutrophils,  but  also  the  subsequent  accumulation  and activation of  monocytes/macrophages, eosinophils, and lymphocytes. It is reasonable to speculate that human PMNs, through the production of IL8, GRO-a, CINCs, MIP-la, MIP-lp, IP-10, MIG, and I-TAC, could play a pivotal role in regulating the switch of the type of leukocyte infiltration typically observed during the evolution of the inflammatory response from acute to chronic stages. Such data reinforce the concept that neutrophils have the potential  to regulate the migration of various leukocytic cellular types into inflammatory sites.

b.  Monocyte  Chewtactic Proteins. Monocyte chemotactic protein-1 is a glycoprotein with a molecular mass of 9-15  kDa, it belongs to the CC family of chemokines (54,  57) and is also known as monocyte chemoattractant and activating  factor (MCAF).  Almost all cells or tissues examined make MCP-1 on stimulation with a variety of agents, but  the targets  are limited to rnonocytes and basophils (54,57). MCP-1/JE is known to strongly stimulate  chemotaxis of  peripheral  blood  monocytes, and  to  modulate several monocyte responses, including the  respiratory burst, calcium influx,  adhesion  molecule  expression,  release  of  lysosomal enzymes,  and rnonocyte-mediated inhibition of tumor cell growth (54,  57). MCP-1 also exhibits chemotactic  activity toward basophils, eosinophils, and lymphocytes,  but not neutrophils (54,57). In addition, MCP-1  directly up-regulates monocyte cytokine production,  and cytostatic activity (54, 154). Interestingly, monocytes are the primary source of this cytokine, and respond  to TNF-a, with  increased  MCP-1 production  in  an  autocrine  manner (54,

154). Reports have revealed the existence of two related  proteins,  MCP2 and MCP-3, which, respectively, share 62 and 73% amino acid homology with  MCP-1 (156). MCP-2 and  MCP-3 also  share the  chemoattractant specificity of  MCP-1 for monocytes in uivo (156).

Attempts to determine whether MCP-1 mRNA gene expression can be induced in human neutrophils, either after adhesion or after  stimulation with LPS, produced negative results (20). Subsequently, Van Damnie and colleagues  developed  sensitive  HIAs  for  MCP-1  and  MCP-2 (157). In agreement with the previous study (20), they could not detect any extracellular release of either MCP-1 or MCP-2 by PMNs, even though neutrophils were  stimulated  for  up  to  48  hr  with  optimal  doses  of  many  agonists, including IL-lB, IFN-/3, IFN-y, GM-CSF, PMA, and LPS (157). In contrast,  Hum et nl. (15N), by  using  Northern  analysis, RT-PCH, and  IH, reported  that  MCP-  1 transcripts  and  antigenic  protein  were  absent  in freshly  isolated  neutrophils,  but  were  clearly  detectable  in  neutrophils incubated for 20 hr in tissue culture medium. Under similar experimental conditions, however, we were unable to detect any MCP-1 transcripts by Northern blot (M. P. Husso, unpublished observations). Similarly, Hachichaet nl . (25) reported that mRNA for MCP-1, MCP-2, MCP-3, HANTES, or 1-309 was  undetectable  in  PMNs  stimulated  for 3 hr  with  TNF-a, GM-CSF, MSU, and CPPD, either alone or in combination. Additionally, neither  MCP-I mHNA nor  protein  was  detected  in  neutrophils  treated for up to 24 hr with graded doses (0.001-100  pghnl) LPS, heat-killed M. tuberctilosis, or  PPD (SO), or  in  response  to  immobilized anti-ICAM-3 antibodies (101).  Contradictory findings on the i n uivo expression of MCP1 in  neutrophils  also exist,  and  will  be  discussed below. These various observations emphasize  the  need  to  conduct  further  studies  aimed  at clarifying  whether, or under which specific conditions, human neutrophils express MCP-1 mHNA and protein.

## B.  TUMOH NKCIWSIS FACT OH-^

Tumor necrosis Factor-a,  paracrine and endocrine mediator with potent a imiiiunomodulatory~~ilatory  d proinflummatory  properties, plays a major role in an host defense (159). Biologically active TNF-a is a hoinotrinier  consisting of  17-kDa subunits that is  produced  mainly by activated monocytes and macrophages  (159). TNF-a  belongs  to a superfamily  of membraneanchored and soluble cytokines, including lyniphotoxiii-a  LT-a) and LT-( 0, Fas ligand, CD30 and  C1)40L,  as  well a s their  respective  receptors, which collectively  constitute a class of molecules that are centrally involved in T cell immunity (160). TNF-a exerts a variety of strong proinflamniutory effects on different cell types, such as the induction of  catabolic states ill adipocytes,  of endothelial cell adhesion niolecules,  of plasniinogen activator

and its inhibitor, as well as tliat of other cytokines, and so forth (159).  A s a  result,  TNF-a  significantly contributes  to  vasodilatation, thrombosis, leukocyte recruitment,  bone  resorption,  matrix degradation  in  cartilage, changes in  liver metabolism, pannus  formation, and cachexia, consistent with the important role attributed to TNF-a in many disease states (159). In  addition,  TNF-a  has  been  shown  to  be  a  primary  mediator  of  the pathology seen in endotoxic shock, and to be selectively cytotoxic  for many transformed  cells, especially  in  combination  with  IFN-y.  Many  of  the biological actions of TNF-a occur in combination with other cytokines, as part of  a cytokine network. The cellular targets of TNF-a include monocytes,  macrophages,  lymphocvtes,  eosinophils,  and neutrophils (159).  In the latter cell type,  TNF-a increases PMN adherence to vascular endothelium, enhances neutrophil  phagocytosis and antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity, and triggers neutrophil degranuhtion, as well as the release of reactive oxygen metabolites (161). Moreover, under certain conditions, TNF-a is also a very potent priming agent for neutrophil  functions (161).

The first evidence on TNF-a mRNA expression in PMNs was provided by  Lindemann et al. (162), who  analyzed  neutrophils  stimulated  with GM-CSF.  Under these  conditions, however, PMNs  did  not  release  the TNF-a protein-an observation that was  repeatedly confirmed in  subsequent  studies  (50, 163, 164). Indirect  evidence  for  the  involvement of released TNF-a  in the granulocyte-mediated killing of two extremely TNFa-sensitive  cell  lines,  namely, WEHI  sarcoma 164 and  L929  cells, was published almost at the same time by Mandy and colleagues (165). Similarly, indications for  a constitutive release  of  a TNF-a-like  molecule by inflammatory PMNs, harvested from the peritoneal cavity of mice injected with  casein  were  also  reported  but  not  substantiated  at  the  molecular level (166).

Molecular evidence of  the ability of  PMNs to express TNF-a inHNA and secrete the related protein was first obtained using LPS as a stimulus (6, 7). Indeed, PMNs exhibited increased  levels of TNF-a mRNA, and released approximately 160- 190 pg/ml/5 X lo5  cells of TNF-a into culture supernatants in  response to 5 Fg/ml  LPS ( 6 ) . Djeu et al.  ( 7 ) confirmed that LPS (1  to 1000 ng/ml) was a good inducer of TNF-a, but additionally reported that incubation of  neutrophils with the opportunistic fungus, C. albicans, leads to a substantial extracellular release of  TNF-a. Mandy et al.  (167) similarly found that human  neutrophils can be stimulated by  C. albicans to produce TNF-a in uitro. Because PMNs are crucial effector cells responsible for the elimination of C. albicans, and because TNF-a is  a potent  activator of  this PMN  function (168), the ability of  PMNs to produce TNF-a suggests the possible existence of  an autocrine feedback loop for self-activation  to muster a host defense against microbes. In this

regard, it  has  been  shown that supernatants from  PMNs incubated with C. albicnns for  18 hr significantly decrease the  number  of  fresh  PMNs demonstrating  features  of  apoptosis, while  increasing the  percentage  of viable PMNs during in vitro culture (169).  Neutralization of TNF-a biologic activity with  specific monoclonal  antibodies partially abrogated the supernatant-mediated prolongation of PM N survival (169). Mandy's  group reported that, in addition to C. albicans, LPS, PMA, and other microorganisms (e.g., E. coli, S. aureus, and Klebsiella pneumoniae) can also stimulate neutrophils to produce (TNF-a) (1 67).  More recently, endogenously  generated TNF-a induced by S. aureus was found to mediate the up-regulation of ICAM-1 observed in S. aureus-treated neutrophils (163).  Furthermore, release of  S. uureus-induced TNF-a was inhibited by the phosphodiesterase  inhibitors  pentoxifylline  and  rolipram,  suggesting that  elevation  of CAMP may represent a mechanism by which the production  of TNF-a is inhibited  in  neutrophils  (163).  In this regard, exogenous dibutyryl cyclic AMP (DBcAMP) significantly inhibited the production of TNF-a in LPSstimulated PMNs (170).

In comparison to LPS, we showed that phagocytosis of Y-IgG by neutrophils induces an extracellular release of TNF-a at much higher levels (8). In  contrast  to  neutrophils,  LPS  proved  to  be  a  more  potent  activator of  TNF-a release  than  phagocytosis in  monocytes or  PBMCs  (8, 171). Interestingly, maximal yields of TNF-a in neutrophil supernatants in  response to Y-IgG or  LPS are detected after  5-10  hr  of  stimulation, and then decline over time (6-8, 171 -1 73). In fact, it can be difficult to detect any TNF-a at all in culture supernatants from PMNs stimulated for 24 hr with substimulatory doses of  LPS (45, 174). However, if very high doses of  LPS are used, then a more sustained TNF-a release over time can be observed (107).  Though it is not clear yet why the yields of released TNFa decay with  time, this also happens to be the case with  MIP-la, which is released by phagocytosing neutrophils (101).  In this regard, phagocytosis carried  out  in  the presence  of  protease  inhibitors such as al-antitrypsin increased the recovery of TNF-a (103),  suggesting that the stability  of the TNF-a protein in the culture medium is influenced by proteolytic enzymes. This is  keeping with  the  ability of  elastase and  cathepsin  G  to  degrade TNF-a specifically (1 75,176),  and with the fact that phagocytosis is a  potent stimulus for neutrophil degranulation (1 77).  On what perhaps constitutes a related observation, Takeichi et al. (52) reported that neither LPS, concanavalin  A  (Con A),  nor  zymosan  was  an  effective  stimulus  for  TNF-a release by  neutrophils,  even though  they noted  that  TNF-a mRNA was induced by those stimuli. Similarly,  in another study (1 78), the same group reported  that  highly  purified  PMNs  (&gt;99.5%)  isolated  from  periapical exudates (PEs)  expressed significant levels of  mHNA for TNF-a (and IL-

ldp),  but that antigenic TNF-a was  not detected in those exudates. The authors attributed  these  conflicting results to the  fact that  their  TNF-a assay was not  sensitive enough (52), or that  TNF-a produced by PMNs was  adsorbed  by active TNF receptor-expressing cells (178). In  view of the  convincing evidence  generated  by  several other  groups,  that  LPSstimulated PMNs do release TNF-a (50, 51, 124, 179) and even express the TNF-a membrane-bound  form (170), another potential  explanation for  the  negative findings of  Takeichi's group  might  be  that  under  their experimental conditions the TNF-a protein was proteolyzed.

An  important role for surface CD14 in mediating the ability of  LPS to induce TNF-a secretion in neutrophils  emerged from a recent study by Haziot et al. (180). In that study, stimulation of neutrophils under serumfree conditions with complexes of purified LPS-binding protein (LBP)  and low concentrations of LPS (0.1 to 5 ng/ml) resulted  in a release of TNFa that  was  severely inhibited by  anti-CD14  antibodies (180). Similarly, concentrations as low as 0.1 ng/ml of  Salmonella abortus equi endotoxin (which are in  the  same range  as those  observed in  patients  with  sepsis) (181) were shown to stimulate significantly the production  of TNF-a by PMNs ( 1 73). This response was inhibited  in  a concentration-dependent fashion by  several adenosine  receptor  agonists, the  A2  receptor  agonist [5'-(N-cyclopropyl)carboxamidoadenosine, CPCA] being 1000 times more effective than  the  301 agonist (2-chloro-NGcyclopentyladenosine) ( 1 73). Noteworthy is  that  CPCA inhibited  the  TNF-a production  even when administered 2 hr after LPS stimulation (173). Binding of adenosine to A2 receptors is linked to the activation of the adenylate cyclase  and subsequent increase of intracellular CAMP,  and there is abundant evidence that CAMP is  a  potent  negative regulator  of  the  synthesis of  TNF-a (I82)-for instance, the aforementioned  effects of pentoxyfilline and rolipram (163).

Table 1 1 1  lists the stimuli that  are known to induce TNF-a expression in human  neutrophils.  Briefly, these include sulfatides (99),  thapsigargin (94), MP-F2 (102), L. monocytogenes and Y. enterocolitica (183), C. neoformans  and its derivatives (107), LPS from various periodontopatic bacteria (75), and P. falciparurn-infected  erythrocytes (109). In addition to the above stimuli,  Balazovich  and  colleagues (184) reported  that  in  PMNs plated  onto fibrinogen, fMLP stimulates a detectable  release  of TNF-a within 45 min, with  maximal production  by  90  min  (184). Under  these conditions, PMNs also released H2O2  and lactofenin with kinetics similar to those of TNF-a. Because TNF-a is a potent agonist of adherent PMNs (185), the authors additionally investigated the effects of neutralizing antiTNF-a antibodies in their experimental model. The latter inhibited both Hz02  and lactoferrin release, whereas rabbit IgG, anti-HLA-A, anti-HLAB,  anti-HLA-C, anti-CD14, and anti-IL-8 antibodies were all ineffective

( 1 8 4 ) . Furthermore, treatment  of  PMNs with either actynomycin 1 3 (Act D) or cyclohexyinide (CHX)  resulted in a partial (33%) inhibition of 11202 and lactoferrin release, suggesting that protein  synthesis was required for this fMLP-mediated activation of adherent PMNs. The addition of TNFa to  either  CHX or  of  Act  D-treated  PMNs  overcame their  inhibition, indicating that  the effect was specific for TNF-a. Finally, a coinbination of antibodies against both TNF-a receptors resulted in a significant inhibition  of  fMLP-mediated  activation of H202 and lactofenin  release. Taken together, these  findings support the  hypothesis that  TN  F a release  arid ligation of  TNF-a receptors  are central for fMLP-stimulated oxidant release  from  PMNs  adherent  to  fibrinogen.  In  contrast,  Derevianko  and colleagues were not able to detect any TNF-a released by PMNs previously adhered to plastic surfaces, or to sudaces precoated  either with fi1)ronectin  (Fn)  or laniinin (Ln),  and then  stimulated  for up to 24 hr with  fMLP (100  nM) ( 7 4 ) . Untlcr these conditions, however, IL-8 was clearly rcleasetl by fMLP-stimulated cells ( 7 4 ) . In agreement with Derevianko ct crl ( 7 4 ) . we ( 5 ) and others (286) have been  unable  to demonstrate  any c 4 k t of fMLP on  TNF gene  expression  or  release  in  PMNs.  Even  though  we cannot  for~nally xclude the possibility that  the  experimental  conditions e that  we  roiitinely use  might  not  be  optinial (9, it  was  recently  reported

that fMLP, over a wide concentration range (1 M-1 n pM), failed to induce the production  of  TNF-a by  PMNs (170).  Moreover, the  latter  authors found  that  fMLP  (1 pM) actually  inhibited  the  release  of  TNF-a  by neutrophils treated with LPS (170); similarly, fMLP was shown to inhibit TNF-a production in PMNs costimulated with IFN-y and LPS. The mechanisms underlying this inhibitory action of fMLP were also explored, and a number of interesting observations were made (170).  First, the pattern of CD14 and LPS binding sites remained unaltered in PMNs after fMLP treatment,  whereas  the  CDll/CD18 complex, which  has  also been  described as an LPS receptor (1R7),  was up-regulated  (170). Second, it was excluded that the lower levels of TNF-a found in supernatants of fMLPtreated PMNs could be due to the adsorption of TNF by soluble TNF-a receptors  released from PMNs (170). Third, fMLP did not diminish the levels  of  TNF-a mRNA  induced  by  LPS. Finally, as evaluated  by  flow cytometry, fMLP decreased to basal levels the membrane-bound form of TNF-a induced by LPS (170).  Together, these findings strongly support the view that fMLP does not stimulate TNF-a gene expression or release in  neutrophils.  From  a  more  general  point  of  view,  these  studies  also indicate that fMLP, which is  usually viewed as a proinflammatory agent, can assume an anti-inflammatory  role under certain specific circumstances.

Another agonist that has been proposed to induce TNF-a gene expression and secretion in  PMNs is  IL-2 (188). Release of TNF-a protein by IL-2-treated PMNs was  reported  to be dose and time dependent  (188). Though CHX did not affect the accumulation of TNF-a mRNA in  IL-2treated cells (1000 U/ml), it d d   block that induced by GM-CSF (188).  In addition, CHX superinduced TNF-a gene expression in cells stimulated with  IL-8 or  heat-killed C. nlhicans. Thus, it appeared  froin  that  study that various induction pathways exist in PMNs for the TNF-a gene (188). Interestingly,  the  IL-2-induced  TNF-a release  was  inhibited  by  monoclonal antibodies raised against the f l chain of the IL-2 receptor (IL-2RP) (188).  This is  consistent with previous studies by the same group, which demonstrated that neutrophils express IL-2RP (but  not IL-2Ra)  a molecule also found to be involved in the killing of  C. alhicans by  IL-2-stimulated PMNs (189).  On a related  note, the cloning of the IL-2 receptor y chain (IL-2Ry) in  Sugamura's laboratory (190, 191) led to the observation that this  molecule is  constitutively expressed in  granulocytes (192); this  was subsequently confirmed by several other groups (193-196), including our own (90).  The relevance of the latter finding is illustrated by the fact that IL-2Ry is an indispensable component of high- and intermediate-affinity IL-2 receptor complexes, because its cytoplasmic domain plays a critical role in mediating intracellular signal transduction (190, 191).  On the basis of the above considerations, it would appear that neutrophils express inter-

mediate-affinity IL-2 receptors consisting of the and y chains. However, Sugamura's  group did not limit their investigations  to IL-2Ry; in particular, they found no evidence that neutrophils express either IL-2Ra or IL-2HP (192);  the lack of / 3 chain expression in PMNs was also observed by Philips et nl. (193).  These discrepancies with the data of  Djeu's group (189)  were attributed to nonspecific antibody binding in the latter case,  because PMNs were not pretreated with serum or human IgG (189),  a step that is essential for the specific staining of the P chain on the cell surface (192).  This being said, another study did provide evidence for IL-2HP surface expression in PMNs, using adequate staining procedures (194). Though the latter study somewhat fueled the controversy surrounding the issue of IL-2Rp expression in  PMNs, it also provided a highly interesting piece of information. Indeed, it showed that even though up to 70% of  neutrophils  expressed IL-2RP on  their  surface,  less  than  20%  of  the  cells were  able  to  bind fluorescent-labeled IL-2 (1 4).  Thus, it appears that neutrophil populations 9 bind IL-2 very poorly, regardless of whether the cells express IL-2RP. In contrast to the IL-2RP controversy, numerous groups have observed that neutrophils  do not  express IL-2Ra  (86, 189), a subunit that  is  required for high-affinity binding of IL-2. This indicates that in addition to binding poorly to neutrophils,  IL-2 does not even bind with high  affinity. If true, the latter conclusion  raises serious concerns  over the  reported  ability of IL-2 to stimulate neutrophil function. In this regard, we repeatedly failed to observe any effect of  IL-2 toward TNF-a or  IL-8 mRNA expression and  release  by  human  neutrophils.  Our  negative  results  could  not  be attributed to a poor  biological activity of  the three different  commercial preparations  of  IL-2 that we used (at doses ranging from  1 to  10,000 U/ ml), because  they were all  effective in inducing lymphocyte proliferation and cytokine production  from  autologous mononuclear  cells. In  keeping with our data, Girard and colleagues found that  IL-2 neither affected Cle novo RNA  synthesis, nor  did  it  induce  the  synthesis of  any  individual protein  species in  neutrophils  (1 94). Interestingly,  the  latter  study  also revealed that  in  PMNs stimulated with  IL-2 in  coinbination with  a fixed concentration of GM-CSF (but not of TNF-a or fMLP),  a dose-dependent effect of  IL-2 toward the  induction  of  both  RNA  and protein  synthesis was  observed (194). This therefore  suggests that  IL-2 may  actually have the  ability to  stimulate  neutrophils,  yet  only  under  very  specific conditions-such as when the cells are 'primed' by  GM-CSF (or perhaps by other agonists).

The ability of  PMNs to release TNF-a in  response to  many  different stimuli suggests that  the  role  of  granulocytes within  the  context of  host defense goes well beyond the killing of invading microorganisms in septic infections. Secretion of TNF-a by  neutrophils may contribute to the nu-

merous  metabolic  effects  that  TNF-(r  elicits in  the  host,  but  may also represent a mechanism whereby neutrophils can activate themselves in an autocrine/paracrine  fashion (197).

## C.  FAS IGAND L

Accumulating  evidence  indicates  the  Fas  (APO-l/CD95)/Fas  ligand ( FasL) system  represents  an  important  cellular pathway responsible  for the induction  of  apoptosis in various tissues (198). In addition to its role in the induction of  apoptosis, the Fas system has also been  suggested to function  as  an  autocrine  pathway  to  T  cell  suicide  (199). Fas/CD95, a member of the TNF/nerve growth factor family, is  a widely expressed 45-kDa  type  I  membrane  protein  which  mediates  apoptosis  following its ligation with agonistic anti-Fas IgM Ab or FasL (200). FasL, a 40kDa type  I1 protein, is also a member of  the TNF/NGF  superfamily; in contrast to  Fas,  however, the tissue  expression of  FasL  is  relatively restricted, but has been reported to be inducible (200).  Importantly, soluble forms of FasL capable of inducing  apoptosis have been found to be secreted by  activated cells (201).

Among the leukocytes, mature human neutrophils have the shortest lifespan and die rapidly via apoptosis, both i n vivo and in vitro (202).  It must be stressed, however, that neutrophil survival can be significantly extended by certain growth factors (G-CSF, GM-CSF), proinflammatory cytokines (IFN-y, IL-1, TNF, and IL-6), bacterial products (LPS), and even glucocorticoids (203).  Within the context of the ongoing search for the mechanisms ultimately responsible for the regulation of apoptosis in neutrophils, the findings that normal PMNs are highly susceptible to Fas-induced death raised the possibility that the Fas system could play a fundamental role in the regulation of spontaneous neutrophil apoptosis (204).  Further support for this hypothesis was the demonstration of the presence of FasL on the surface  of  mature  human  neutrophils  (32). Experiments  performed  to examine the effects of antagonistic anti-Fas IgG, and Fas-Ig (deployed as a soluble receptor for FasL)  significantly  reduced the spontaneous neutrophil death i n vitro by approximately 50% during a 72-hr time course (32). In addition,  neutrophils  were shown to release a biologically active, soluble form of  FasL capable of specifically reducing the viability of  target cells in a coculture system (32). Taken together, these findings not only suggest that  the Fas system could  represent  a key  element controlling the  rapid spontaneous turnover of neutrophils, but also implicate a possible role for FasL in neutrophil-mediated cytotoxicity (205).

The coexpression of FasL and Fas in PMNs, as well as their involvement in inducing spontaneous PMN apoptosis, have been fully confirmed  (33, 206). In one study, the effects of EBV on the expression of the Fas/FasL

antigens were evaluated, in view of the fact that EBV can induce neutrophil apoptosis (206). Exposure of  neutrophils  to  EBV was found  to  increase the expression  of Fas and FasL significantly  on the neutrophil outer surface; moreover, the kinetics of  this increase paralleled those  of  EBV-induced neutrophil death (206).  However, even though EBV exposure concurrently induced the release of  soluble FasL, treatment of freshly isolated neiitrophils  with  supernatants  from  EBV-treated  neutrophils  failed  to  modify significantly the  rate  of  spontaneous  apoptosis of  the  naive  neutrophils (206).  Thus, whereas this study did not clearly establish the  involvement of the Fas/FasL system in the EBV-induced apoptotic process, the possibility  that  the  Fas/FasL  system  might nevertheless  play  an  important  role, perhaps  in  synergy with  virally encoded  proteins,  remains.  Despite  the uncertainties that remain about the intricacies of  the Fas/FasL system in neutrophils, the number of studies aiming to elucidate the signal transduction pathway linking Fas engagement to neutrophil  apoptosis is currently growing at ii rapid rate. In time, such studies are likely to provide important insights  into  the  inechanisms whereby  neutrophil  apoptosis  is  induced through the Fas system, and how neutrophil apoptosislsunival are niodulated by inflammatory agents.

## D.  CD30 LICAND

CD30, a member of the NGFRNF receptor superfmnily, is preferentially expressed by Th2-type CD4+ T cell clones a s well as by CD8'  T cell clones  showing  a  Th2  profile  of  cytokine  secretion  (207). The  natural ligand for CD30, CDSOL, has been shown to be a type I1 transmenibrane glycoprotein of  the TNF ligand superfimily (207). CDSOL is  reportedly expressed by B lymphocytes,  as well as by a subset of activated macrophages and T cells (207).  We were among the first to show that CD30 engagement induces NF-KB  activation in human T cells (208), a finding that has potential implications for the development of TI12 responses and the control of HIV replication (209).

Gruss ut ul. (34) initially  reported  that  PMNs  constitutively express CDSOL mRNA (but not CD30 mHNA), and that after 24 hr of stimulation with  LPS, IFN-.)I,  or GM-CSF, the steady-state levels of  CD30L inHNA were  slightly  increased.  They  also  found  that  in  reactive  lymph  nodes and  tonsils, CD3OL was  expressed by  a  small subset  of  lymphoid cells, histiocytes, and  neutrophils,  as  determined  by  inimunostainirig and  flow cytoinetry ( 3 4 ) . Higher levels of CD3OL expression were noted in Modgkin's  disease (HD)  lesions among bystander cells, which included T cells and PMNs (220). Remarkably, native CD3OL displayed at the cdl siirfice was  functionally active, as shown by  the ability of  fixed PMNs to interact with CDSO-positive cell lines and to induce their proliferation (210).  Our

unpublished  experiments confirm that neutrophils  express high  levels of CDSOL mRNA, especially after stimulation  with LPS or fMLP. In addition, we  observed a variable CDSOL protein  expression pattern  in neutrophils in  immunofluorescence analyses, depending on the donor. The biological implications  of CDSOL expression  on neutrophils require further investigations. For instance, it is  known that the interaction between CDSOL and CD30 triggers the  replication of  HIV (209, 211). In  addition,  Ho et nl. (212) showed that  human  neutrophils  can potentiate  HIV replication in infected mononuclear leukocytes, but did not identify the mechanism or the  molecules implicated  in  these  effects.  In  the  light  of  the  potential ability of  neutrophils  to exprw CDSOL, one obvious candidate for this interesting  effect  could  be  the  CDSOL.  It  has  been  shown  that  crosslinking of  CDSOL  by  a  mAh  or by  a  CDSO-Fc fusion  protein  induces the production of  IL-8 by freshly isolated neutrophils (35). These results indicate  that  cross-linked C113OL  can  transduce  a  signal to  the  ligandbearing cell.  This 'reverse signaling'  via CDSOL strongly  suggest that TNF family members and their cognate receptors signal bidirectionally,  blurring the distinction between  ligancl and receptor.

## E . I NTEHLE~J 1 KIN-

Interleukin-1 is an important  mediator of  the host defense response to injury and infection, and has both protective and proinflammatory effects (213). The production  and action of  IL-1 are so important that  they are regulated by multiple control pathways, some of which are unique to this cytokine,  in a so-called IL-1 system (214). This IL-1 system consists of two agonists, IL-la and IL-IP, a specific activation enzyme ( IL-1-converting enzyme, ICE), a receptor antagonist ( IL-1RA) produced in different isoforms, and  two  surface-binding molecules, the  type  I  and  type I1 IL-1 receptors  (IL-1R1, IL-1RII) (213,  214). A wide variety of cells, including monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, lymphocytes, NK cells, endothehum, fibroblast,  glial cells,  and keratinocytes,  are able to secrete IL-1 (213). A vast phenoinenological literature on the activities of  IL-1 exists, and it is almost impossible to list them. IL-1 affects the hematopoietic system at various levels, from immature precursors to mature  inyelomonocytic and lymphoid elements. In particiilar, IL-1 costiinulates T cell proliferation in the classic costimulator assay. induces cytokine production in monocytes, prolongs  the in  uitro survival of  PMNs,  activates endothelial  cells  in  a proinflammatory, prothrombotic sense, and stimulates the release of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH)  by the hypothalamus, ultimately causing a release of  corticosteroids in  the bloodstream by the adrenals (213) Furthermore,  IL-1 is  a key mediator of  the acute-phase  response, and is the  main  endogenous  pyrogrn,  an  activity shared with  other  cytokines,

including TNF-a and IL-6. In uiuo, IL-1 induces hypotension, fever,  weight loss, neutrophilia,  and acute-phase  response.  IL-1 has a number of local effects that  have  been  termed  catabolic, and plays  a  role  in  destructive joint  and  bone  diseases (215), in  addition  to  having  an  important  toxic activity against insulin-producing p-cells in the Langerhans islets. In addition, a number of observations support a role of  IL-1 in the pathogenesis of  many diseases (215).

Although the issue of whether or not PMNs synthesize and secrete IL1  has been a matter of debate for several  years (216-218), molecular studies have clarified this issue. There is no longer any doubt that neutrophils can be  induced  to produce  small amounts of  IL-1, not  only in  humans,  but also in mice (219), rats (220), rabbits (221-223), and cattle (224). Reasons for past failures to detect IL-1 may include a poor sensitivity of the assays available at  the  time (21  7, 218), and/or inappropriate  stimulatory conditions. For instance, it has been reported that muramyl dipeptides (MDPs) or their derivatives do not induce IL-1 activity in neutrophil supernatants or  lysates (225). In  that  study,  however,  neutrophils  were  cultured  in serum-free medium (225), a procedure  that  adversely affects neutrophil viability (226). In  other  cases, contaminating  monocytes present  in  cell preparations have been proposed to account for the IL-I production attributed to PMNs (217,  218).

That human PMNs, produce an IL-1-like activity after stimulation with particulate  and  soluble agents, such  as  zymosan  and PMA, respectively, w a   clearly  documented by Tiku and colleagues (227). This IL-1-like  activity was  detected  in  the  supernatants of PMNs only if  cells were  stimulated for at least 4-5 hr, and was  also induced by  A23187 plus cytochalasin €3, as well as by LPS, albeit at much lower levels (227). Interestingly, though no IL-l-like activity was present  in  a preformed state or stored in PMN granules (228), an indirect  indication  that  cell  lysates  of  resting PMNs contained an endogenous inhibitor of  IL-1 was  also provided (228).

Subsequently, neutrophils stimulated with GM-CSF were found to express  the mRNA and  to  release  both  IL-la  and  IL-ID  (9, 229,  230). Although PMNs produced both IL-la and IL-1p in response to GM-CSF, the  number  of cells producing  IL-la was  greater  and  they  were  more strongly stained  than  those  secreting  IL-lD,  as  revealed  by  an ELISASPOT (229). What is  more, exposure to GM-CSF of PMNs isolated from saliva did not result in a further increase of IL-lD production (231), implying that these cells were already maximally activated in situ, presuniably in response to the oral flora. Indeed, oral PMNs accumulated IL-1p mHNA and produced  IL-1p in  amounts  severalfold greater  compared to  those released by peripheral PMNs activated in uitro with GM-CSF (231). Partial elucidation of the  mechanisms whereby GM-CSF regulates  IL-lp gene

expression in  PMNs has been  reported  by  Fernandez et al. (232), who demonstrated effects of GM-CSF at both the transcriptional and the posttranscriptional level.

Human PMNs have also been shown to produce both forms of IL-1 in response to LPS, zymosan, and Con A, IL-lP being produced and released before  IL-la, over a 72-hr culture period (52,  233). Lord et al. ( 1 1 ) not only provided evidence that PMNs transcribe and translate the IL-la and IL-lj3 genes after stimulation with LPS or IL-la, but clearly established that IL-la and IL-lj3 synthesis attributed to PMNs was not accounted for by  the  low level of  contaminating  PBMCs. Although virtually all  PMNs showed diffuse staining with both IL-la- and IL-lj3-specific antisera, synthesis of IL-lj3 exceeded that of &amp;la, and little or no IL-la was released by PMNs over an 18- to 24-hr time course ( 2 1 ) . Another very interesting observation made by this group was that although increases in IL-1 mRNA after stimulation of PMNs and PBMCs with LPS were similar, PMNs were less efficient than PBMCs in translating IL-1 mRNA ( 1 1 ) . Because IL-la and IL-lP mRNA from either PMNs or PBMCs were translatedwith equal efficiency in rabbit reticulocyte lysates, it was speculated that synthesis of IL-1 in PMNs is subject to some form of translational control ( 1 1 ) .

Other  researchers  have  once  again  questioned  whether  LPS-treated neutrophils produce IL-1 following endotoxin treatment (229,  234). In an ex vivo model of localized cytokine production that closely mimics i n vivo conditions, that is, stimulation of  human whole blood with  LPS, Hsi and Remick (234) found that positivity for IL-lj3 in  PMNs by  immunohistochemistry was very low and did not increase over time. In the same model, monocytes displayed a marked IL-lP signal that increased by 4 hr of  LPS stimulation (234). In contrast, several demonstrations by other groups not only confirm that both  LPS (51, 103, 124, 172, 235, 236) and GM-CSF (237) up-regulate the expression of  IL-10 in human PMNs, but provided evidence  that  endogenous  IL-lP exerts  an  essential role  in  prolonging neutrophil survival (238,  239). Increased expression of  IL-lj3 mRNA and release determined by  LPS and GM-CSF were also shown to be reduced by herbimycin A, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, and pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate,  an  NF-KB inhibitor (239), but  not  by  difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), a selective inhibitor of  ornithine decarboxylase (240,  241 ).

IL-lj3 mRNA accumulation is induced in a dose-dependent manner also by TNF-a and/or IL-1j3 ( l o ) , but not by IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, or IFN-.), (230). Though  the  relative levels of  the  cell-associated antigenic IL-lp induced by TNF-a and/or IL-lP strongly correlated with the induction of IL-lP mRNA, no IL-lP antigen can be detected in the supernatants of  PMNs incubated with or without cytokines for less than 4 hr (10). In agreement with these observations, we (124) and others (242) also found

that  neutrophils  produce and  release  IL-1P not before Fj-6 hr following stimulation with TNF-a (124). Interestingly, neonatal PMNs were shown to accumulate cell-associated antigenic IL-1P when  stimulated  by  TNFa and LPS, and this expression was consistently higher than that of  adult PMNs (186).  The elevated  IL-lP expression by  neonatal  PMNs  rnay  be significant for  imrnune and inflammatory regulation in  neonates.

Table IV lists  the  stimuli able  to  trigger  the  production  of  IL-1fi by PMNs.  Included  are  superoxide anion (243), rheumatoid  synovial fluid (244), C. neofolrnans and glucuronoxylomannan ( 1 07),  L. monocytogenes and Y.  enterocoliticn (183), C. alhicnns or MP-F2 (245), OK-432, an immunopotentiator prepared from streptococci (246), the nonoral organism Fusobacterium mortifenm (247), LPS from F. nucleaturn and A.  actinoniycetenlcomitans, P. gingivulis and C. ochracea (75), and EBV (121). Another condition  inducing  the  mRNA  expression and  production  of  IL-  lfi by neutrophils is the phagocytosis of yeast particles (103). Though kinetics of IL-lp, TNF-a and IL-8 secretions in response to opsonized (Y-IgG)  and unopsonized ( Y ) yeast particles were similar, the absolute amounts of IL1P detected  in  the  supernatants  of  PMNs  stimulated with  yeasts  alone were  usually  higher  than  those  obtained  with  Y-IgG-stimulated PMNs, whereas  the  amounts  of  TNF-a and  IL-8 were  lower (103). Similarly, serum-opsonized zymosan was  more  potent  than  LPS  in  triggering  the

extracellular production  of IL-1P (171). Even fMLP (100 nM) has been shown to induce  the  release  of  detectable  amounts  of  IL-10 by  PMNs (74), and its effect, as well as that of  LPS, was enhanced by the precoating of tissue culture plates with the matrix proteins Fn and Ln ( 7 4 ) . In contrast to  these  findings,  and  similar  to  the  case  of  fMLP-stimulated  TNF-a release, we (4,  248) and others (186) have  never been  able to  measure any intra- or extracellular IL-lP in response to fMLP (10-100  nM). However, we  have repeatedly detected a transient  induction of IL-lP mRNA accumulation in fMLP-treated PMNs (unpublished experiments).

Brooks and co-workers (242) demonstrated that neutrophils can be stimulated to express IL-1P mRNA and protein by antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs),  which are present in patients with systemic  vasculitis. Both  human  ANCAs  and  mAbs to a variety of  autoantigens  recognized by ANCAs, including proteinase 3, myeloperoxidase (MPO),  bactericidal/ permeability-increasing protein,  and  elastase, were  effective (242). This response  could be  inhibited  by Act  D  and  CHX, but  not  by  FK506 or cyclosporin  A (242). Besides,  human anti-MPO IgG F(ab),  were completely without effect on IL-lP production  (and on superoxide production), suggesting the  requirement  for  Fc receptor  involvement. Indeed, the  mAb Fab IV.3 (anti-FcyRII)  induced IL-1P  production from neutrophils treated with  normal  serum (242). Because neutrophils  accumulate  in  the  acute blood vessel lesions of  patients with  autoimmune systemic vasculitis, the data  suggest that,  in  these  individuals, ANCAs  may  stimulate  PMNs  to release IL-lP,  other than activating neutrophils to produce reactive oxygen radicals and to degranulate (249). The possibility that neutrophil-derived IL-lP may contribute to augment the local inflammatory response by the activation of vascular endothelial cells and infiltrating leukocytes must thus be considered for therapeutic intervention.

The capacity of  neutrophils  to synthesize and release  I L - l d P  species after phagocytosis  of  MSU and CPPD, alone, or in combination with TNFa and  GM-CSF, was  tested  in  other studies (250,  251). Phagocytosis of MSU  and CPPD crystals by joint  neutrophils  is  in  fact  associated with acute gout and pseudogout (252). PMNs are the major, if  not the only, cell type within the synovial  fluid in the initial phase of such crystal-induced attacks. It was demonstrated that  MSU  crystals are more potent inducers of both IL-la and IL-lP generation compared to CPPD or unopsonized zymosan (250). With all three stimuli, the synthesis of IL-1P was 5to 14fold greater than that of  IL-la, and up to 10 times more IL-1P than  ILla was usually secreted (250). Colchicine, a specific and effective drug in the clinical treatment of  acute gout, partly inhibited  the secretion of  IL1 by  neutrophils during phagocytosis of solid particles (250). The results suggested that neutrophil-derived  IL-1 contributes to the pathogenesis of

crystal-induced arthritis.  Subsequently (251), it  was  observed that  treatment of PMNs with GM-CSF and TNF-a before incubation with suboptimal concentrations of the crystals enhanced the total synthesis  of microcrystal-induced IL-1 by five- to ninefold, over a 12-hr  incubation period. Under the  same conditions, the  levels of  total  IL-1  RA produced by  neutrophils were approximately 35 to 43% lower than the expected amounts produced by  cytokine-treated  cells (251). As  a  result  of  this  shift  in  IL-1 and  IL1HA production  by  GM-CSF- and TNF-a-activated  neutrophils, the net biologic  activity of  IL-1  secreted  in  response  to  the  microcrystals  was enhanced. Treatment of  neutrophils  with  colchicine prior  to  incubation with  GM-CSF or TNF-a inhibited  the crystal-induced IL-1 production by SO to SS%, but failed to affect that of IL-1  HA. In this situation, therefore, the IL-1HA to IL-1 ratio increased significantly  by 185-220% (250). These results not only denionstrated that IL-1 and IL-1RA production by human neutrophils is differentially regulated, but that the combined presence of GM-CSF or TNF-a and microcrystals favors the production of biologically active IL-1 over that of IL-lRA, thereby potentially amplifying the inflaiiimatory response associated with crystal-induced diseases. In addition, because colchicine selectively inhibited  IL-1 without affecting IL-1KA production, a novel putative site of  action of  this drug was  uncovered.

Finally, neutrophils from healthy subjects were analyzed under culture conditions of  low  (5 X 10fi/ml)  and  high  (100 X 10b/ml)  cell density for 18 hr, to investigate the effect of cellular density on IL-10, 5-lipoxygenase (S-LO), and 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein  (FLAP) gene  expression (253). Only high-density conditions lead to the  induction of  IL-10 gene at the  HNA and protein  levels (within 2.S hr), as  measured  by  RT-PCK and by immunoprecipitation. In contrast, S-LO mRNA accumulation decreased  in cells cultured at  high  density, whereas  FLAP  mRNA was not affected (253). Interestingly, experiments with  synovial fluid  neutrophils obtained from rheumatoid arthritis patient deinonstrated that the pattern of  IL-lP, S-LO, and  FLAP production  was  similar  to  that  observed  in peripheral blood neutrophils cultured at high density (253). These results suggest  that  cellular  density  may  play  a  role  in  gene  modulation when neutrophils are accumulating at an inflaininatory site at high density.

In so many situations neutrophils  can produce  IL-la and  IL-10, with profound effects during inflammation and, as a consequence, pathophysiological implications. Release of IL-1 in concert with TNF-a may trigger a nilinher of effects, such as recruitment and regulation of leukocye function, priming of  neutrophils  for oxidative activity, phagocytosis, degranulation and stimulation of the production of arachidonic acid metabolites, rcgulation of fibroblast,  osteoclast, and synovial cell activation,  induction of fewer, and so forth ( 1 , 2 1 3 ) . These actions may fulfill  immunoinodulatory functions

that  may  be  beneficial for the host, but, if  dysregulated, may contribute to the pathogenesis of the diseases in which IL-1 is involved.

## F.  INTERLEUKIN-1  EPTOR  NTAGONIST REC A

The IL-1 receptor antagonist has been characterized as a 23- to 25-kDa glycosylated protein  made by  the same cells that  secrete IL-1 (254). IL1RA is an anticytokine that specifically  inhibits the proinflammatory actions of IL-1 by binding to IL-1RI and IL-1RII located on a target cells,  without initiating  any  signal  transduction  or  biological  activity (255). Different structural variants of  IL-1RA have been described: the  secreted form(s) produced by mononuclear cells, and two intracellular isoforms (icIL-1RA) found in keratinocytes and other epithelial and myelomonocytic cells (254). The biological function played  by the cell-associated fraction of  IL-1RA remains largely obscure.

The  first  reports  suggesting that  neutrophils  might  secrete  products featuring IL-1 inhibitory activity were those by Tiku and colleagues (227, 228), but  the  molecular demonstration  that  this  IL-1 inhibitory activity corresponded to IL-1RA was provided later by McColl's group (14). While studying the  neutrophil  production  of  an  IL-1-like  factor (227), Tiku's group observed that the addition of  PMNs to monocytes cultured in the presence  of  zymosan  led  to  a  decreased  biological  IL-1  activity of  the resulting supernatants, relative to those harvested from monocytes stimulated in the absence of PMNs (228). A possible explanation  was that PMNs released an inhibitor of IL-1. A better characterization of this PMN-derived IL-1 inhibitory activity  revealed that (l),   was constitutively  present either it in  lysates of  freshly isolated PMNs or in cell-free supernatants obtained from PMNs stimulated or not for 18 hr, (2) it could be generated in the absence of  serum  and it was  not  produced  as  a  result  of  the  activity of neutrophil-proteases,  and ( 3 ) it  was  constitutively contained  in  greater amounts than  IL-1 (228). The latter observations might provide another explanation  for the difficulties  reported by various investigators  in detecting the production of IL-1 by PMNs, especially when measured in biological assays (see  above).  McColl's  group not only confirmed the data that neutrophils constitutively produce  IL-1RA (14), but also showed that following activation  with TNF-a and GM-CSF, PMNs express the mRNA and secrete increased amounts of IL-1RA protein over a 24-hr period (approximately 0.5 ng/rnl/lO6  cells) (14). The same authors concluded that IL-1RA constitutes one of the most abundant de novo-synthesized proteins of  activated neutrophils. They also calculated that IL-1RA is produced by neutrophils in excess of IL-1 by a factor of at least 100;  such a ratio fits perfectly with the reported  amounts of  IL-1RA needed  to inhibit the proinflammatory effects of IL-1 (213,254,255). In addition, they found that none of a large

array of classical neutrophil  stimuli (fMLP, G-CSF, IL-lP, IL-4, TGF-P, or IFN-y), including LPS, influenced the extracellular production  of  1L1RA  by PMNs. All ofthein were used over a 24-hr period, and  t concentra8 d tions ranging  from sub- to supraoptimal doses (14). The reasons that McColl and co-workers were not able to identify LPS as an effective stimulus for the  induction  of  IL-1HA synthesis (14) or de  novo RNA  synthesis (256) by neutrophils remain intriguing. Possible factors  that could have hampered the detection of any modification of neutrophil gene expression in response to LPS are the conditions used to isolate and culture PMNs-for instance, inappropriate use of serum-free culture medium. It is well known that in order to stiinulate phagocytes at low doses, LPS necessitates binding different serum proteins, which  in  turn bind  to CD14 (257). However, it has also been demonstrated that high  doses of  LPS (&gt; I00 ng/ml) can bypass the  requirement  for  serum  proteins,  and  alone can  efficiently stimulate the target  cells (257). Finally, it is  also possible that  the particular batch or strain of  LPS used by  McColl's group was  not properly working.

That PMNs express increased levels of IL-1HA mRNA and protein after incubation with LPS was originally demonstrated by Ulich and co-workers (15). Importantly,  extent  of  IL-1HA  mRNA  expression  found  in  LPStreated  PMNs was  in  magnitude  similar  to,  or  even  greater  than,  that found in PBMCs (15). LPS proved to be a very efficient stimulus for the production of IL-1HA in PMNs also in our hands, being much more potent than Y-IgG (248, 258). Consistent with a poor ability of Y-IgG to induce IL-1RA in  neutrophils,  Malyak et  al.  (23S) also  reported  that  adherent IgG did not trigger the production of IL-1RA from PMNs. It is noteworthy that  the  stimulation of  hurnaii  inonocytes with  LPS  or  IgC, these  latter either  in  a  soluble  form (259) or  attached  to  plastic surfaces (260), led instead to approximately the same amount of  IL-1RA production. These results  suggest that  the  ability  of  PMNs  and  inonocytes to  secrete IL,1RA in response to specific agonists, acting presumably through the siiine receptors,  is  regulated  by  distinct  mechanisms. Whether  this  difference between  inoiiocytes  and  neutrophils  is  due  to a greater  ability  of  the monocyte Fc  receptors  to  generate  intracellular  signals  for  expression, translation, and  secretion  of  IL-1RA  remains to be  investigated. In  this respect, data by Chang et  al.  (261) indicated  that  adherent  anti-FcyHIII (CD16) mAbs, but not anti-FcyRI or anti-FcyRII inAbs, induce the production of  IL-1RA from PMNs.

Elegant studies performed by Colotta and collaborators have shown that in  addition  to  LPS  arid  GM-CSF ( 4 8 ) , also IL-4 (48), IL-13 (4Y), and TGF-PI (262) are  efficient  inducers  of  IL-1RA  mHNA  expression  and secretion in PMNs. These studies have also revealed that in PMNs, either IL-13 or TGF-P, induces the  mHNA expression of  an intracellular form

of  IL-1RA (icIL-1RA) (49,  262). The observation that TGF-P (262,  263) is  able  to  trigger  the  production  of  IL-1RA might  constitute  one  of  the mechanism(s) whereby IL-1RA is constitutively produced by  PMNs (14, 228,  235,  258). TGF-P activities  seem  in  fact  also  to  be  constitutively released by  PMNs (16, 17), and could therefore stimulate the same cells to produce IL-1RA through an autocrine loop. Colotta's  group cloned and characterized  a new intracellular isoform of  IL-1RA expressed in  PMNs and other cells, which was  termed icIL-1RA type  I1 (icIL-1RAII) (264). icIL-1RAII was  found to be potentially biologically active, and to  differ from  the  previously known  icIL-1RA (icIL-1RAI) only by  an  additional stretch of 21 amino acids located within the NH1-terminal portion of the molecule (264).

Table V summarizes the list of the agents able to induce IL-1RA release by PMNs in uitro. These include A23187 and zymosan (228), thapsigargin (94), MSU, CPPD (251), 10 nit4 fMLP (248), and P. falcipanm-infected erythrocytes (209). But there are other experimental conditions in which IL-1KA is expressed in neutrophils.  For instance, functional studies have shown that stimulation of PMNs with a number of periodontopathic bacteria results in the production of an IL-1 inhibitor. These bacteria include P. gingivnlis, Bacteroides  f o r s y t h s ,   A.  actinomycetenzcomitans,  F. nuclenttim, and the nonoral F. nzortferuin (247). More recently, these data have been

confirmed, in  that  substantially great  amounts of  IL-1RA were  found  to be released froin PMNs stimulated with LPS deriving from P. gingivnlis, A. cictinoi,iyceternconiitnns, C. odiracen, and F. nuclentziiri (75).  In addition, the inhibitory effects of IL-1KA on tlie biological activity of  IL-1 in PMN assay. PMN supernatants stimulated with  these lipopolysaccharides, and especially these from P. gingivnlis or C. oclzrncen, showed less biological IL-1 activity as compared with the same doses of recombinant human IL10 detected by ELISA (75). These findings demonstrated that LPS froin periodontopathic bacteria are able of stimulating PMNs to release not only proinflammatory cytokines such as  IL-1, TNF-a, and IL-8 (75), but  also antiinflammatory substances, such as  IL-1RA. Therefore, different secretion levels of these cytokines and their biological activities induced by the various lipopolysaccharides  might be important in the onset and progression of  periodontal diseases (265). supernatants  were  examined  by  the  thymocyte coinitogen  prolifer  t' a 1011

EBVis another agent that alters the gene expression  and protein synthesis of IL-1 and IL-1RA in human peripheral blood neutrophils (121,266). EBV induces a rapid accumulation of  IL-1 and IL-1RA mRNA in  neutrophils, followed by a later appearance of considerable synthesis of  IL-la, IL-10, and IL-1HA proteins.  In response to  EBV, neutrophils  secreted approximately 3200 and 610 times more IL-1KA than IL-la or IL-10, respectively (121). Pretreatment  of  cells with  CHX or phosphonoacetic  acid (known to  inhibit viral  DNA  polymerase activity) did  not  abrogate  the  effect  of EBV, suggesting that EBV does not penetrate the cell, but that a virion's structural  molecule is  required  to induce sucli an effect. In this  respect, neutralization of  the viral particles with  a  monoclonal antibody reacting with glycoprotein a350 of  the viral envelope inhibited the production of IL-1 and  IL-1  RA.  GM-CSF differentially modulates  EBV-induced IL-1 and IL-1KA production by neutrophils, in that it synergistically enhances tlie production of IL-la  and IL-10,  while it poorly affects IL-1RA synthesis (267). However, more than 94% of the IL-la and IL-10 produced remain cell  associated (267). The elevated  levels of  IL-1HA  produced  by  EHVstimulated PMNs might be useful for the virus to induce immunosuppression  and  to  avoid  rejection  at  the  early  stage  of  its  infectious  process. Conversely,  the effect of GM-CSF may enhance host response hy altering the ratio of  IL-1HA to IL-1 in  favor of IL-1.

In  conchision, the  findings that  PMNs, in  addition to exerting a series of proinflammatory activities,  may also produce 11,-1 receptor agonist siiggest that  these cells can  also mediate  antiinflammatory actions. Because IL-1RA blocks the activities of IL-1  both in vitro and in uiuo, the production of  relatively large amounts  of  IL-1HA by  neutrophils  could be of  major

biological  significance in that it could contribute to inhibition of established inflammatory or immune responses mediated by IL-1 (213,  254).

## G.  INTERLEUKIN-6

IL-6 is  a multifunctional cytokine that exerts multiple effects on  many different types of  target  cells (268). It is  a terminal  differentiation  Factor for  B  cell  maturation,  a growth factor for  myeloma, plasmacytoma, and hybridoma cells,  T cells,  mesangial cells,  and megakaryocytes,  and (depending on the context) a pro-  or antiinflammatory factor (268). IL-6 shares several  activities  with  IL-1  and  TNF-a, insofar  as  it  potently  induces the acute-phase  response in  the liver, has pyrogenic properties, and can stimulate the proliferation of hematopoietic progenitor  cells, from which osteoclastic cells  are  derived.  IL-6  is  synthesized  by  a  wide  variety  of cells, including fibroblasts, T and B cells, macrophages, endothelial cells, astrocytes, and  keratinocytes; when  purified  from  natural  sources,  1L-6 consists of  a single chain of 21-28 kDa (268).

There is no general consensus among researchers involved in neutrophil research about whether or not human PMNs express or release IL-6. This controversial issue can be said to have originated in two articles that were published  in  1990. In  one  of  them  (269), it  was  shown  that  following stimulation of whole blood with LPS or Con A, the  IL-6-expressing cells were exclusively monocytes. In the other article, Cicco et al. (270)  reported that stimulation of PMNs with GM-CSF, and to a lesser extent with TNFa,  leads to a rapid accumulation of IL-6 mRNA and subsequent secretion of  the protein, as  measured  in a bioassay. In addition to  LPS, PMA  and CHX were also described as inducers of  IL-6 transcripts in PMNs (270). In disagreement with the latter study, we provided clear evidence for the total lack of  IL-6 gene expression by neutrophil preparations that are free of contaminating monocytes, whether or not these PMN preparations are cultured for up to  18 hr in  the presence of  LPS or Y-IgG (8).  Though it could be argued that our failure to detect IL-6 in neutrophils ( a s opposed to the autologous  PBMCs) might reflect limits in the sensitivity  of Northern blot  analysis, it  should be pointed  out that  IL-6 mRNA transcripts  were equally undetectable  following HT-PCR analysis of  neutrophil  preparations, he  it  in  unstimulated  cells  (90)  or following PMN  treatment with LPS, GM-CSF, or CHX (M. P. Russo et ul., unpublished  observations). In keeping with our observations, and with the initial report by  Kato and colleagues (269),  several other studies have emphasized that the detection of IL-6 transcripts in human PMNs might be accounted for by contarninating monocytes. In particular, it was demonstrated that ifmonocyte contamination of  neutrophil  preparations  is  kept  below 0.8%,  then  IL-6 release from  PMNs is  undetectable, even following LPS stimulation  (51).  Con-

versely, LPS stimulation was  shown to be a potent  inducer of  IL-6 gene expression (51), as  shown  previously  by  us  (8)  and  many  other  groups before us. In another study, in which peripheral blood PMNs monocytes, and lymphocytes  were stimulated with zymosan, Con A, or LPS (52), both monocytes and lymphocytes were observed to secrete high levels of  IL-6, whereas no iininunoreactive IL-6 was detectable in PMNs. In that study, the authors'  use of  a very sensitive radioactive RT-PCR  analysis further were expressed in zymosan-stimulated PMNs than in cells stimulated with LPS or Con A,  IL-6  mRNA remained  undetectable under  any of  these conditions (52). Again, IL-6 transcripts were highly expressed in activated autologous monocytes and  lymphocytes (52). Identical  results were  observed in  PMNs isolated from the gingival crevicular Huid  from patients affected by periodontitis ( 5 2 ) , or from alveolar bone-derived PMNs On a final note, other investigators  also reported on the inability  of neutrophils  to  secrete IL-6 in  response  to  less  common  stimuli. For  instance, PBMCs were  found to secrete large amounts of  IL-6 in  response  to P. f~lci~n~~,,i-infected  rocytes, whereas autologous granulocytes did not eryth ( 2 09). Similarly,  stimulation of highly pure PMN preparations with thapsigargin led to the release of  IL-8, GRO-a, and IL-lRA, but not IL-6

revealed that  though  higher  mRNA  levels of  IL-la, IL-lp, and TNF-a! (178). (94). The studies reviewed thus Far strongly  suggest  that PMNs do not express or secrete IL-6, and that any such effect is artifktual, but there nevertheless exist  several published  articles  supporting  the  opposite  conclusion. For instance,  Miariji and  colleagues reported  that  LPS  induces  IL-6 mRNA expression and  release in PMNs (271). Curiously,  in this latter work, neither PMA  nor  GM-CSF had  an  effect  on  IL-6 mRNA  abundance (271), in contrast with other findings (237,270). Similarly,  Palmaet al. ( 1 72) reported a  time-dependent  release of  IL-6  in  response  to  LPS, which  reached  a maximum after 24 hr;  substantial levels of  IL-6 transcripts were also detected  in  resting neutrophils  (1 72). Though other investigators reported that no IL-6 mRNA signal is detectable in  freshly isolated neutrophils  (as determined  by  RT-PCR) (272), stimulation with  LPS or zyinosan for  1 or 3 hr  nevertheless  resulted  in  the  accumulation of  IL-6  inRNA (45). In  the  latter  study, however,  no  IL-6 protein  could  be  detected  in  the corresponding culture rnediurn (45). In contrast, zymosan was reported to stimulate the  IL-6 secretion in  PMNs isolated from normal subjects, but not  from breast  cancer patients (273). Similarly, PMNs were reported  to release  large amounts  of  IL-6 following phagocytosis of yeasts  (C. neofi)rnuiti.s) or of  bacteria  such as L. nwnocytogenes, Y. enterocoliticn, and E. coli, or even following  exposure to RSV particles (61,107, 183).  Furthermore,  release  of IL-6  was  also  found  with  nentrophils  stimulated  for 24 hr with E. coli  LPS serotype B5 or B12 and, to a much lesser extent,

with  bacterial  extracts  from A. actinornycetemcomitans or P.  gingivalis (274). Taken  together,  these  studies  indicate  that  LPS  and  phagocytic stimuli can promote IL-6 mRNA accumulation in PMNs; with the exception of  one study (45), it also appears that the IL-6 protein  is  released in response to the same stimiili. Finally, IL-6 mRNA was detected by  RTPCR in PMNs after FcyRI or FcyRII cross-linking, and after in  vitro or in  vivo treatment  with  G-CSF (275). The  IL-6 protein  was  synthesized and secreted at very low levels, as determined by flow cytometric analysis of  intracellular proteins  and ELISA, respectively (275). A synergistic increase  in  IL-6  secretion  was  also  observed  when  PMNs  isolated  from patients  treated  with  G-CSF were  stimulated in  vitro by  anti-FcyRI  or anti-FcyRII cross-linking (275). It is, however, well known that antigenic FqRI is  nearly undetectable  on  freshly isolated  neutrophih  of  normal donors (276,277). On the basis of the aforementioned studies, it therefore appears that in human  PMNs, certain stimulatory conditions do result in IL-6  gene  expression and  release.  Among  the  proponents  of  this  idea, however, a far less obvious conclusion is the issue of whether unstimulated neutrophils express IL-6 mRNA, and similarly, whether the IL-6 protein is  constitutively released.  Indeed, some of  these investigators report that IL-6 mRNA and protein are undetectable in resting neutrophils (13,  45), yet others found high constitutive levels of IL-6 transcripts (172), or high IL-6 release in resting PMNs from both normal donors and breast cancer patients (273). In  this  regard,  Melani et nl. (272) reported  that  freshly isolated circulating human  granulocytes (98% neutrophils, 1.2% eosinophils, 0.8% mononucleated  cells) constitutively express  IL-6  inRNA  (as determined by RT-PCR  or ISH). Interestingly, the constitutive expression of the IL-6 gene was very weak when neutrophils were isolated from buffy coats instead  of  fresh, heparinized  peripheral blood.  Furthermore,  IL-6 expression became undetectable if  PMN  suspensions were incubated as briefly as 60 min on ice, or at 37°C in Dulbecco's  modified Eagle's medium. Yet  IL-6 expression was still inducible by the addition of GM-CSF ( S O ng/ ml) for another hour (272),  as observed by others (237). Thus it appears that  PMN isolation procedure, or the different  anticoagulants used, can substantially affect  the  constitutive  expression of  IL-6  in  PMNs (272). Though this study has the distinguished merit of shedding  some light on the confusion surrounding the issue of  IL-6 gene expression in unstiinulated neutrophils, its findings regarding the inducibility  of the IL-6 gene by GMCSF are in complete disagreement with those of  Mianji et al. (271), who reported  that  neither  GM-CSF  nor  PMA  had  any  effect  toward  IL-6 mRNA levels in human neutrophils.

In  summary, the  issue of whether  IL-6 expression and  release occurs in  human  neutrophils  remains an open question, based  on the  available

literature. This being said, there exists compelling evidence emphasizing the  need  to  exclude false positives due to contaminating  inonocytes (8, 51 ), Similarly, the potential role of  contaminating eosinophils should also be taken into account; first,  because the proportion of eosinophils  in various neutrophil preparations typically ranges from 2 to S%, and second, because eosinophils have  been  reported  to  express  IL-6  mRNA actively and  to release  the related protein in considerable amounts (272,278,279). Finally, it was reported that though PMNs from normal donors exhibit little IL-6 inHNA (RT-PCH) and protein even after LPS stimulation, the production of  IL-6 is  three to six  times  more elevated in  PMNs from HIV' patients at all stages of infection, both under basal conditions and after stimulation with LPS (13,  102). Thus, the discrepancies observed in studies addressing the production  of  IL-6 in human  neutrophils  may well be related  to the presence of contaminating eosinophils and/or inonocytes in different neutrophil preparations, or perhaps (to ii lesser extent) also related to whether HIV+ individuals are unknowingly used ;is blood donors. Alternatively, it is also conceivable  that particular stimuli (or  pathological  conditions) might specifically  induce  IL-6  in  human  PMNs.  Whatever  the  case  rnay  be, fiirther studies are clearly required before  any definitive conclusions can be drawn about the ability of human PMNs to express or release IL-6. In contrast  to  their  hnman  counterparts,  the  ability of  inurine  neutrophils to  produce  IL-6,  both in vitro and in vivo, appears  to  be  undisputed (see below).

## H. ON(:OSTA.I.IN M

Oncostatin M  (OSM), a member of  the IL-6 fiimily of cytokines that is synthesized by activated human T lymphocytes and inonocytes, was originally  identified  as  a  growth  regulator  for certain  tumor  and  non-tuniorderived cells (280). Although the physiological role of this cytokine reniains largely undefined,  OSM  has  been  shown to  promote  the  stirnulation of acute-phase protein synthesis, iis well a s the induction of  IL-6 expression, i n  several cell types (280). Another study showed also that OSM stirnulate$ several  I ' M N functions,  incliiding their  transmigration  across  confluent inonolayers of  primary endothelial cells (281). Conversely, the potential ability  of neutrophils to serve as ;i source of OSM was recently investigated (281). Highly purified  PMNs were  found to contain preformed  OSM  in intracellular stores that were rapidly inobilized by CM-CSF or PMA. In addition, PMNs were also observed to produce OSM after a few holm of stirnillatioil with  various agonists. The  most  potent  effect  was  obscrved following costitnulation with LPS and GM-CSF, a combination that  upregulated  both inHNA and  protein  levels  of  OSM.  Iriterestingly, OSM production was clown-regulated by tlexamethasone, but not by I L-  10.  The

OSM  produced  by  PMNs  was  also  found  to  be  biologically  active,  as demonstrated  by  its  ability to  induce  al-acid glycoprotein synthesis by HepG2 cells (282).

IL-12, a heterodimeric factor of 70  kDa (p70),  is formed by two covalently linked glycosylated chains of approximately 40 and 35 kDa, respectively, whose coexpression is  necessary for biologic activity (283). IL-12 is produced mainly by  mononuclear phagocytes, B cells, neutrophils, and dendritic cells  (283). The  biological activities of  IL-12  are  mainly directed toward NK cells and T lymphocytes, in which it induces the production of lymphokines (particularly IFN-y);  it enhances cell-mediated cytotoxicicity in addition to exerting mitogenic effects. IL-12 is also required for the optimal differentiation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and appears to have an obligatory  role as inducer of differentiation of T helper lymphocytes  toward the Thl type, as well as suppression of IgE synthesis (283, 284).

The first demonstrations that  mature human  neutrophils  produce and release  both  the  IL-12 p40 free  chain  and  the  IL-12 p70  heterodimer originated from my laboratory (12).  Our experiments showed that among a wide range of stimuli  tested, only LPS in combination  with IFN-.)I efficiently induced  a significant production  of  biologically active  IL-12, whereas  in monocytes  LPS was  effective by  itself  (12).  This was  attributed, on  the one hand, to the fact that  LPS induced a 100-fold increase in  IL-12 p40 mRNA without having an effect on IL-12 p35 mRNA accumulation, and on  the other hand, to the fact that  IFN-.)I  directly induced a severalfold increase in the accumulation of IL-12 p35 mRNA and enhanced the LPSinduced accuinulation of IL-12 p40 mRNA. Therefore, the combined effect of  LPS and IFN-y induced sufficient expression of both  IL-12 p40 and IL-12 p35 mRNA to achieve production  of the biologically active  IL-12 p70 heterodimer, at physiologically relevant concentrations  (12). A study by Cassone et al. (13)  has fully confirmed and extended our initial findings, by showing that neither  LPS nor  MP-F2, used alone, was  able to induce biologically active IL-12 production by PMNs,  whereas these two microbial-derived imunomodulators induced monocytes to release appreciable levels of IL-12 (13).  owever, when used in combination with IFNH y, both  MP-F2  and  LPS  were  capable  of  inducing  PMNs  to  produce IL-12  (13).  In  agreement with  these  observations, several studies  have established that the genes encoding the two IL-12 subunits are independently regulated  (285-287). As previously shown in monocytes (288),  or for  other proinflammatory cytokines produced by  neutrophils  (289),  we also found that IL-10 suppressed the LPS-induced IL-12 p40 mRNA and the secretion of  IL-12 in PMNs costiinulated with  LPS and IFN-y (12).

In a subsequent  study, we additionally observed that the release of  IL-12 induced  by  LPS  plus  IFN-y did  not  significantly differ  for  PMNs  froin HIV' patients and I-IIVindividuals (290).  In autologous  PBMCs, however, the production of IL-12 occurring in  response to LPS, or LPS plus  IFNy, was  significantly higher in cells isolated from HIV' patients  (290).

Expression arid production of  IL-12 have also been reported in  inurine nentrophils  stimulated in vitro and in vim, using different  experimental approaches, including iminunofluorescence staining  and microscopic  analyses (291,  292).  Thioglycollate-elicited  neutrophils cultiired for 24 lir in the presence of  IFN-y plus  LPS or with C. nl/iicavi.s (either the agerininative live vaccine strain I'CA-2,  which provokes healing infections, or the highly virulent  CA-6 strain, which  induces  nonhealing  infections), were  tested for cytokine production  (291, 292). Low levels of bioactive IL-12 and IL10 were found in PMN  cultures stimulated with  IFN-y plus  LPS. IL-12, but not IL-10, was produced in  response to the agerminative strain PCA2, whereas  the  opposite pattern  occurred  in  response  to  CA-6 (291). A similar cytokine production profile was observed in stimulated neiitropliils isolated from peripheral blood (291).  As  revealed by HT-PCH,  IL-12 p40 and IL-10 messages, together with those of TNF-a and 1L-6,  were present in  elicited neiitropliils cultured  with  LPS plus IFN-y for 2 lir (292). In contrast,  tinder  the  same  stimulatory  conditions,  the  IL-6  and  TNF-cr messages, hut not those encoding IL-10 and IL-12 p40, were present  in peritoneal macrophages (291).  The release of IL-12 by murine neutrophils stimulated  by  LPS  plus  IFN-+y  was  greatly  enhanced  if  the  cells  were preincubated  with  IL-4  (293). Although  we  did  not  observe  a  sirnilar effect of IL-4 in human neutrophils (onr  unpublished observations),  similar findings were reported  in the case of  human monocytes (294).

PMNs also produce IL-12 in other situations. For instance, peritoneal neutrophils and splenic inacrophages harvested from iron-overloaded inice and stimulated in uitro with IFN-y and LPS were tested for candidacidal activity and expression of inducible nitric oxide syntliase (iNOS) and IL12  p40 genes in another study (295).  Iron overload greatly increases inurine susceptibility  to disseminated infection with low-virulence C. nlbicniis cells (295).  The  results showed that  iron  treatment  rednced  the  candidacidal activity from both uninfected and infected mice. In contrast, modulation of  expression of iNOS and IL-  12 p40 genes was dependent on the types of cells and on the infectious state. Iron loading caused the disappcanuiccl of both types of inessages in nentrophils from uninfected or intectrd mice. as well as i n   inacrophages froin  nninfected  inice (295). Likewise, tlie i i i oitro prodiiction  of  NO  and  1L-12 was  impaired  in  ncwtrophils  (295). Howwer, treatment of iron-overloaded inice with desferoxamine (an iron chelator) cured tlic.  infection, and restored both the candidacidal potential

and the appearance of iNOS and IL-12 p40 messages in neutrophils (295): consequently, a Th  1  protective antifungal response took place (295).  Neutrophils isolated from TNF/LT-a  double-deficient mice were stimulated with  IFN-y plus  LPS in vitro, showing no impairment and releasing IL12 whether the cells were obtained from uninfected animals or froin mice infected with C. albicans (296).

Enriched populations of dendritic cells, macrophages, and neutrophils (80%  pure),  isolated from the peritoneal cavity of mice following  thioglycollate administration, all responded to UV-inactivated or live herpes simplex virus (HSV),  as well as to LPS, by up-regulating the expression of IL-12 p40  mRNA  (297). These  experiments were performed  to  clarify which types of  cells are responsible of the IL-12 expression and release in  the cornea and draining lymph node on ocular infection with HSV (297).  The data indicated that among the inflammatory cells that infiltrate the cornea in  response  to  HSV-1 infection, the neutrophil  is  the  prodominant  cell type, and might therefore  represent an important source of IL-12.

In light of the important jmmunoregulatory functions of IL-12, in particular  the  induction  of  IFN-.)I  production  and facilitation of  Thl-type  responses, the  ability of  neutrophils  to produce  IL-12 suggests that  these cells may play an active role in the regulatory interactions between innate resistance and adaptive immunity.  Production  of  IL-12, TNF-a, IL-lp, and other molecules by PMNs, and of  IFN-y by  NK cells, suggests that the  activation  of  innate  resistance  early during infection  represents  not only a first line of  defense against invading microorganisms, but also that it  could prime  the  immune  system and determine the  characteristics of the ensuing antigen-specific  adaptive immune response. It is even possible to imagine a dynamic situation in which IL-12 produced by PMNs (and other phagocytic cells) in  response  to bacterial or parasitic infections induces the production of IFN-.)I  by T and NK  cells, which in turn activates the phagocytic cells (298)  and at the same time favors a Thl-type immune response. If so, IL-12 could be involved in an effective positive feedback mechanism that,  through  IFN-.)I, could  induce  the  activation  of  PMNs and monocytes. As such, IL-12 might represent a bridge between innate resistance and adaptive immunity. Evidence of the ability of  neutrophils to mount Thl/Th2 responses in vivo is  described  below.

## J.  INTEHFEHON-a

The interferons are a family  of closely  related inducible secreted proteins; they are important not only in defense against a wide range of viruses, but also in the  regulation of the immune response and in hematopoietic  cell development (299).  Though there is only one IFN-.)I  and one IFN-P gene, to date there are  13 IFN-a functional genes reported, encoding as many

IFN-a protein species (300).  IFN-a is produced by most cells (but mainly by leukocytes) in  early response to viral infections, following stimulation with natural or synthetic double-stranded RNA such as poly(  I:C), as well as in response to bacterial, mycoplasma, and protozoan infections, and to certain cytokines (299). In addition to inducing a potent antiviral state in uninfected  cells,  IFN-a, at  higher  concentrations,  has  antiproliferative activity against both normal and tumor cells and is important in regulating cell-mediated  immunity  as  well a s some  aspects  of  humoral  immunity, because can enhance, for example, the expression of  class  I  MHC gene products, natiiral killer cell activity, and macrophage activation (299).

The first exhaustive molecular demonstration of the ability of neutrophils to express and release the IFN-a protein was  reported by Shirafuji et ( 1 1 . (28).  Prior to that, however, another study had showed that PMN-enriched fractions possessed very low levels of  IFN-a mHNA transcripts, as  measured by S1-nuclease mapping, but contained no data at the protein level (301).  B y   Northern blot analysis, Shirafuji et nl. (28)  were able to demonstrate  that  G-CSF induced  the  mRNA for IFN-a type  1 in  neutrophils, but  not  in  PBMCs.  Moreover,  a  radioimmunoassay specific  for  IFN-a revealed that the levels of  IFN-a in the culture media of  G-CSF-treated neutrophils  rose,  in  a time-dependent  manner,  up  to  100 U/ml  per 10' cells after  12 hr, whereas those of  unstimulated  cells remained  at about 20 U/mL Under the same experimental conditions, neither  LPS (10 ng/ ml)  nor  fMLP  (1 nM) effectively  stimulated  the  expression  of  IFN-a mRNA or protein in neutrophils. It is worth recalling that LPS and fMLP, unlike G-CSF (82),  induce the expression of  IL-8 in  PMNs (60).  In view of  the recently demonstrated ability of  IL-8 to inhibit IFN-a activity and to  attenuate  the  IFN-mediated  inhibition  of  viral  replication  (302), the selective production of IFN-a by G-CSF-treated neutrophils might represent a specific effector response against viral infection.

Other  studies  have  confirmed  that  PMNs  produce  IFN-a. In  one  of these, Brandt et nl. (29),  using  RT-PCR,  were able to show that  PMNs acciimulate IFN-a mRNA either in a constitutive manner or on infection with Sendai virus, being  IFN-al, IFN-a2, and IFN-a4, the species predominantly expressed in these cells (29).  A biological assay revealed that the levels of antiviral activity  of supernatants recovered from PMNs stimulated with Sendai virus were very similar to those detected in MNCs, md, surprisingly, much more abundant than those  measured  from purified T and  B  cells  (29). In  earlier  studies (303), bovine  neutrophils  were  also shown to produce a factor with antiviral, IFN-like properties. This IFNlike factor appeared in  detectable amounts 12 to  18 hr after exposure of PMNs to fragmented  herpesvirus-infected  cells (303),  and could not  be neutralized by antibodies to bovine IFN-a, -p, and -7 (304).  Neutropliils

infected with  BHV-2, herpes simplex virus type 2, equine herpesvirus  1, bovine respiratory syncytial virus, bovine viral diarrhea virus, or parainfluenza virus 3 were unable to produce this IFN-like  factor (304).

Although only limited attention has been paid to the role of neutrophils in viral infection, the fact that neutrophils can be significant  sources of IFNa or IFN-like molecules emphasizes the potentially  important role of PMNs in host defenses against viral infection, or in other biological processes in which interferons are  implicated.  Furthermore,  because IFN-a  inhibits  neutrophil colony formation i n zjitru (300), release of IFN-a by PMNs may be also viewed as a feedback regulatory mechanism for neutropoiesis.

## K.  INTERFERON-?

IFN-y,  also  known  as  type  I1  interferon  or  immune  interferon,  is  a glycoprotein mainly secreted by T cells and NK cells having weak antiviral and  antiproliferative activity. Through  its ability to activate macrophages to become tumoricidal and to kill intracellular parasites, IFN-y is responsible  for  inducing  nonspecific cell-mediated  mechanisms of  host  defense (305). IFN-y induces  the  expression of  many key  molecules, including MHC class I and I1 antigens, cell surface ICAM-1, nitric oxide synthase, and cheinokines (305). Other than being a macrophage-activating factor, evidence has shown that IFN-y is also a neutrophil-activating factor (306). IFN-y  induces  the  surface  expression  of  FcyRI,  enhances  neutrophil antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity (ADCC), potentiates  the generation of reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI)  and granule release jn response to different  stimuli,  and  modulates  neutrophil  microbicidal activity (306). Clinically, IFN-y has  been  shown  to  alleviate the  symptoms of  chronic granulomatous disease and to exhibit potential benefits in  the treatment of  infectious disease and neoplasia (307).

Evidence  that  PMNs  might  synthesize  IFN-y  has  been  provided  by Yeaman et al. (308). Highly purified human  PMNs were cultured for 18 hr with or without G-CSF, in the presence or absence of IL-12, and then examined  by  confocal  microscopy.  An  accumulation  of  specific  IFN-y iinmunoreactivity in the PMN population cultured either in the presence or in  the  absence  of G-CSF was  found, although  the  staining was  more intense in cells treated with 1L-12 (308). IFN-y positivity was present only in one-third of the total PMN population, and was dependent on brefeldin A treatment (308). To determine whether  IFN-y was  secreted, cell-free supernatants were assayed after incubation of  neutrophils with LPS,  IL12, TNF-a, and  IL-12 plus  TNF-a for 24 hr.  ELISA  testing  revealed increased levels of  IFN-y in  supernatants  collected from  LPS-, TNF-a-, and especially IL-12 plus TNF-a-treated neutrophils (308). These findings were  supported  by  other  observations on  the  production  of  IFN-y in

human endometria, by using confocal microscopic analysis (308). xtracelE lular IFN-.)I  as mostly associated  with matrix components, and was located w immediately beneath the luminal epithelium and along the glandular epithelium  proximal  to  the  lumen. As evidenced by  intracellular  staining, IFN-y was present  in  both  stromal cells and intraepithelial  lymphocytes through all stages of the menstrual cycle (308).  Interestingly, the stromal cell containing intracellular IFN--y  was identified as a polymorphonuclear neutrophil on the basis of its nuclear morphology (308). As a result, it was suggested that  polymorphonuclear  neutrophils play an important  role in determining immune responsiveness within the female reproductive tract. Though this may turn  out to be true, other investigators Failed  to detect IFN-y in  supernatants  from  neutrophils  stimulated for 24 hr  with  LPS (309). Thus,  additional  studies  are  clearly  required  before  any  further speculation can be  made on  the potential  biological significance of  IFNy production by PMNs.

## L.  TRANSIWIIMIN(: r11  FACTOIW Giiow

TCF-a is a polypeptide belonging to the family of EGF-related proteins (310).  It is secreted by  several cell types, including cells of hematopoietic origin, such as eosinophils (311)  and stimulated macrophages (312).  TCFa elicits different  effects on target cells, such as mitogenic signaling and promotion of  neovascularization, and it is also involved in wound healing and in tumor development (310).

Calafat and colleagues (313),  using iminunoelectron  microscopy, have clearly demonstrated that human neutrophils  and inonocytes store TCFa in cytoplasmic  vesicles. Interestingly, a previous report (314)  also showed that granulocytes stimulated with fMLP plus cytochalasin B released immunoreactive  TGF-a, but  even  though  neutrophils  were  not  excluded  as possible source, it was concluded that eosinophils were the major manuf'wturers  of' TGF-a. In  neutrophils, TGF-a was localized in electron-dense vesicles, whereas  in  inonocytes  TGF-a  was  found  in  the  peroxidasenegative  granules  (313). No  colocalization of  TGF-a  with  coinponerits of  azurophilic, specific, or gelatinase granules,  or secretoly vesicles, was observed in neutrophils. This implied that TGF-a is stored in a novel, not previously described compartment. Other experiments indicated that the TGF-a gene was expressed early in myeloid development, and the protein was stored in granules. Monocytes and nentrophils were also pelleted and lysed to quantify TGF-a using ELISA. Monocytes were found to contain approximately 257 pg of TGF-dlOfi  cells, but neutrophils contained much less, 2.5 pg of TGF-dlOh  cells.

The findings that  neutrophils  contain  TGF-a suggest that  these  cells might contribute  not only to the beneficial effects caused by  chronic in-

flammatory diseases, such as wound healing, but also to the development of  complications, such as  fibrosis.

## M. TRANSFORMING TH FACTOR-@ GROM

The TGF-P family of cytokines is composed of several ubiquitous molecules that are multifunctional and essential to survival (315). Several TGFP isoforins (TGF-P1, TGF-P2, and TGF-P3) exist, and these are secreted as  latent  precursors  whose  activation is  achieved through  the  action  of proteases.  TGF-P  has  multiple  cell  surface  receptors, of  which  at  least two  mediate  signal  transduction (315). Although  TGF-P  was  originally discovered as a secreted factor that induced malignant transformation in vitro, it was  subsequently shown to play important  roles in  inflammation, growth, and development, in would repair, and in host immunity (315). As a general but by no means exclusive rule, TGF-P serves as a conversion factor, converting an active inflammatory  site into one dominated by resolution  and repair (316).

Grotendorst and colleagues  were the first to report that cultured human neutrophils constitutively express TGF-P1 mRNA and secrete high levels of the protein (16). Secreted TGF-P1 was found to be structurally similar to that which is released by human platelets, and appeared to be in  a fully active form, because acid treatment did not increase the amount of TGFP activity (26). After incubation of neutrophils with LPS, fMLP, or immune complexes for 24 hr, no difference in the levels of TGF-P transcripts or protein were detected relative to untreated cells (approximately SO ng/mV lo6  cells) (16). Though stimulation of  monocytes resulted  in  a strong increase  of  TGF-P secretion,  unstimulated  PMNs  secreted  approximately five times more TGF-P-like activity than an equal number of unstimulated monocytes (16). Although the authors correctly hypothesized that the constitutive  TGF-/3  secretion by neutrophils might have been due to neutrophil activation during the isolation procedure, these  results bring about additional considerations. First,  the production  of  TGF-P in  neutrophils  and monocytes seems to be differentially regulated, and second, TGF-P production in  monocytes might be controlled by  posttranscriptional mechanisms. Our  unpublished  observations confirm that  neutrophils  constitutively express high levels of  TGF-P1 mRNA that do not change in  LPS-, IL-lo-, or fMLP-activated cells. Similarly,  TGF-P1 transcripts were found to be constitutively expressed in synovial fluid neutrophils and to be unaffected by cell exposure to GM-CSF (237).

That  PMNs represent  an  important  potential  source of  TGF-/.3 in  inflammatory infiltrates was  confirmed by  Fava et al. (17). They reported that a preexisting  TGF-P  bioactivity  could be released from freshly isolated peripheral PMNs, if incubated with PMA at 37°C for 30 min. The identity

of  this TGF-P activity as TGF-P1 was  confirmed by the use of a specific ELISA. However, in contrast with the findings of  Grotendorst et nl.  (16), Fava et nl.  (17) found  a little  detectable TGF-P1 activity released  from unstimulated  PMNs. Such discrepancies might  be  explained by  the  fact that neutrophils were cultured for only 30 min  (1 7), as opposed to 24 hr (16). Worthy  of  note  is  that  to  date,  no  study  has  examined  whether PMNs specifically or  differentially express TGF-P2  or TGF-P3  mHNA and proteins. This important aspect obviously requires urgent investigation. The capacity of neutrophils  to produce bioactive TGF-P suggests that PMNs may play an important role in situations characterized by inflammation  and  fibrosis,  such  as  in  chronic  iminunodriven  inflammations and immune  responses,  in  wound  repair,  or  in  the  pathogenesis  of  fibrotic disease. Furthermore, in view of  its ability to exert chemotactic activities toward neutrophils and monocytes, the release of TGF-P by PMNs could promote strong local proinflammatory effects (31  7-31 9).

## N . VAS(:U L A I ~ EN 1101'1 I E I . I AL Glww1.i I FAC-TOR

VEGF/vascular permeability fhctor (VPF),  originally identified as a tumor cell-derived  substance, is  a  multifunctional  cytokine  that  exerts  a key role in  physiological and pathological neoangiogenesis, by stimulating endothelial  cell  proliferation  and  vessel  hyperpermeability (320, 321 ). VEGF has also a major role in the pathogenesis of many diseases, including rhc~umatoid  arthritis,  cutaneous diseases, proliferative retinopathies,  and hypervascularized tumors (320, 321). VEGF  is  a  glycosylated hepaiintiinding homodimer that  exists as  one of  four different  isoforms, VE GF 121, VEGF 165, VEGF 189, and VEGF 206, and is produced by several cell  types, including monocytes, macrophages, T  lymphocytes, keratinocytes, and fibroblasts (320-322).

Several studies have demonstrated that human neutrophils  represent a source of VEGF (36-38). In the first one (36), neutrophils isolated from tdood have been found to release VEGF into the cell-free supernatants in response to ionomycin,  phorbol dibutyrate, and serurn-opsonized zymosan (SOZ) particles. The magnitude of the response varied with the stimulant applied and was dose and time dependent in a period of  examination of 2 hr. By iininunohistochemistry, it was also demonstrated that neutrophils infiltrating  inflammatory  lesions, including synovial biopsies from rheuinatoid  arthritis, periapical dental granulomas, chronically inflamed gingival tissues, and mucocele and nonspecific oral ulcerations, contain VEGF (36). In  another contemporary article (37), not only PMA, but also fMLP and TNF-a, were shown to trigger a time-dependent  secretion of VEGF by human neutrophils. PMA-treated neutrophils released significant amounts of VEGF after 15 min, and these remained elevated over a period of 2 to

24 hr. CHX had no effect on the PMA-induced secretion of VEGF, suggesting that the PMA-induced secretion of VEGF acted on a preformed pool of  this  molecule.  The  existence  of  an  intracellular  pool  of  VEGF  was confirmed  by  measuring  the  intracellular  content  of  VEGF  in  resting neutrophils (37). Whereas basically 100%  of the intracellular VEGF content was released in response to PMA, approximately 28 and 31% were released by  adherent  neutrophils  in  response  to  fMLP  and TNF-a, respectively ( 3 7 ) . Kinetics of  fMLP- and  of  TNF-a-induced  secretion  of  lactoferrin and VEGF were similar, suggesting the intracellular localization of VEGF in the specific granule fraction (37). Accordingly, subcellular fractionation of human neutrophils and Western blot analysis showed a granule-specific distribution of  the intracellular pool of VEGF in resting neutrophils (37). More recently, RT-PCR  studies showed that  PMNs  express mKNA for the two most common VEGF splice variants, VEGF 121 and VEGF 165 ( 3 8 ) . However, it was  not  determined which variant is  the predominant VEGF form secreted by  PMNs.

Taken  together,  these  observations  suggest  that  neutrophil-derived VEGF may be instrumental in the development and progression of angiogenic and other vascular  phenomena in inflammatory  processes and tumors. Through  the production  of VEGF and other angiogenic factors such as TGF-a, IL-8, and TNF-a, neutrophils may significantly  influence the evolution of inflammatory  pathologies  involving  modulation of vascular permeability as  seen  in  ischemia-reperfusion injury, rheumatoid  arthritis,  and PMN-mediated glomerulonephritis.  Furthermore, in  view of  the  established chemoattractant properties  of VEGF for monocytes (323), neutrophils may reinforce the recruitment of monocytes to sites of acute inflammation following the initial influx of PMNs.

## 0. HEPATOCYTE OWTH  ACTOR GR F

HGF, also known  as  scatter  factor, is  a  heparin-binding  heterodimer related to plasminogen; it was first recognized as a molecule that stimulates hepatocyte  proliferation (324). It  is  now  known  to  be  a  cytokine with numerous functions, including stimulatory effects on hepatocytes, melanocytes, and epithelial cells, induction of endothelial cells and hematopoietic cell growth,  chemotactic and chemokinetic activities,  activation  of increased motility and scattering of cell colonies, and modulation of organ development (324). HGF has also a role in wound repair, liver and kidney regeneration, and tumor propagation (324). It is produced as a single-chain precursor protein and is proteolitically cleaved to generate the mature molecule, and its gene expression and synthesis is regulated by several factors. HGF binds with high affinity to its receptor, c-met, whose intracellular domain has  tyrosine kinase activity and transduces  all the effects of the cytokine

(325).  HGF can be produced by various cells, including fibroblasts,  epithelial  and  endothelial  cells,  inalignant cells, and  neutrophils  (324). PMN capacity to express HGF was  discovered in  studies aimed  to define and compare  the cellular localization of  hepatocyte  growth factor  in  human and  rat  tissues  (39). For  this  purpose,  paraffin-embedded  sections  and frozen sections  were examined  by immunohistochemistry using a polyclorial antiserum to hepatocyte growth factor (39).  he distribution of hepatocyte T growth factor was almost identical in humans and rats, and, among a variety of cell types, strong cytoplasmic immunoreactivity for hepatocyte growth factor  was  found  to  be  present  in  granulocytes  (39). Subsequently,  by electron  microscopy studies performed  in  tissue  samples obtained  from livers  of control subjects  and patients affected by acute and chronic  hepatitis and cirrhosis, it was confirmed that YMNs represent a source of circulating HGF (40).

Lindeinann et a/. (30)  reported that stimulation of PMNs with GM-CSF induces the  mRNA expression and release of  M-CSF and  G-CSF. Two other groups have reported  that neutrophils cultured with  LPS for 24 hr release significant amounts of G-CSF (31,  309). Remarkably, in one study (31), the endogenous release of  GCSF was  correlated with  the maintenance effect of  LPS on neutrophil superoxide generation and survival.  GCSF is  produced  by  bone  marrow stromal  cells, endothelial  cells, ;ind fibroblasts in  response  to  specific stimuli, and  acts  on  both  graiiiilocyte precursors and mature cells (326).  G-CSF not only enhances the proliferation  of  granulocyte precursors  in  bone  marrow, but  also primes  mature neutrophils for superoxide anion production, phagocytosis, and antibodymediated cytotoxicity against targets such as tumor cells, and delays their apoptosis (202, 326).

Various observations in  the literature indicate that  neutrophils  can express  and  release  other  cytokines, but  the  conclusions reached  are  not always concordant.  For  example, in  one of  these  cases, Ramenghi ct 01. (327)  evaluated by RT-PCR  the cell types in peripheral blood that express the mKNA for stem cell factor (SCF),  the ligand of the c-kit protooncogene. Only granulocytes, but not purified lymphocytes, monocytes, or the total cell population obtained by Ficoll purification, appeared to express transcripts encoding both the soluble and transmembrane forms of SCF (327). In contrast,  in identical types of experiments,  we could demonstrate neither constitutive nor induced SCF InRNA, nor secretion of the related protein (our unpuhlished  observations). Kita and co-workers (32R), on  the  basis of effects detected in biological assays, indirectly assumed that neutrophils

stimulated with PMA in combination with ionomycin (a  calcium ionophore) produce GM-CSF and IL-3. They were, however, unable to measure IL3 and  GM-CSF directly in  neutrophil  culture  supernatants, by  specific immunological techniques  (328). Similarly, other  researchers  (1 6, 309) 8 failed to detect antigenic GM-CSF in cell lysates and supernatants from PMNs Stimulated for  up  to 24 hr  with  TNF-a, LPS,  fMLP, or  IL-1/3. Conversely,  other studies have reported the detection of measurable quantities of  GM-CSF in supernatants harvested from PMNs stimulated with MSU microcrystals (121),  or culturedwith plasma from patients with severe burns  (329).

There  also exist  several other  reports  on  the  ability of  neutrophils  to produce additional factors  whose identity has been only partially  characterized to date. For instance, a novel cytokine mitogenic for connective tissue cells, termed 'leukocyte-derived growth factor' (LDGF),  was  identified in  supernatants of  LPS-activated neutrophils  and  monocytes, and  PHAtreated T cells (330).  The LDGF cDNA hybridized to a 1.3-kb transcript present  in  total RNA  isolated from  activated human neutrophils,  macrophages, and T lymphocytes,  but not from fibroblasts,  bovine smooth muscle cells, or umbilical vein endothelial cells. The peptide produced by T cells exhibited electrophoretic mobility identical  to  the  peptide  produced  by macrophages, but the protein produced by  neutrophils  migrated slightly slower (330). Sequence analysis of the LDGF peptide  revealed that  this polypeptide is a precursor of other known peptides, including platelet basic protein  (PBP), connective  tissue activating peptide  1 1 1  (CTAP-III), and neutrophil-activating peptide 2 (NAP-2). However, none of these shorter peptides is active as a mitogen for fibroblasts.  This suggests that the LDGF gene produces  multiple peptides possesing divergent biological activities that  could regulate  different  phases  of  the  repair  process. The  fact  that PMNs may produce LDGF in addition to other biological mediators that orchestrate  the  cellular  events  during wound  healing  (TGF-P, VEGF) reinforces the  concept  that  neutrophils  are  much  more  important  than originally believed in the  recruitment  and activation of  connective tissue cells to wound sites.

Human PMNs, but not PRMCs, have been shown to secrete constitutively a  mediator  designated  'granulocyte-derived factor'  (GDF) (331 ); the  GDF levels did not change after treatment  of  PMNs with  activating agents such as phorbol  ester, calcium ionophore, poly(  IC), and  IFN-7, or  metabolic inhibitors  such  as  actinomycin D  and  cycloheximide. This factor was shown to enhance the uptake of  [3H]thymidine  by the Molt-3, CTV-1, and K562 leukemic cell lines in  a dose-dependent  manner, and to amplify the level of thymidine kinase activity  in the sensitive cells (331). However, cell number and the rate of DNA synthesis in GDF-responsive

cultures remained unchanged (331). GDF had an apparent molecular mass of  about 40 k  Da, was heat and acid labile, and was  shown to be distinct from a panel of different lymphokines  and monokines (IL-1,  IL-2, IL-4, IL6, TNF-a, GM-CSF, IFN-a) in antigenicity, biochemical, and functional characteristics (331). Although GDF is possibly a novel cytokine that can alter the pattern  of  DNA synthesis and growth characteristics of  certain hematopoietic  cells, its  biologic and  physiologic  significance remains  to be clarified.

Neutrophils from other species also produce specific growth factors, A series  of  studies  on  neutrophils  from  the  inflamed  peritoneal  cavity of rabbits demonstrated that these cells produce a trypsin-sensitive polypeptide  factor  able  to  affect  corneal  endothelid  cells. This  factor,  'corneal endothelium  modulation  factor'  (CEMF) (332), is a  polypepiyde  that affects cell shape and collagen gene expression in corneal endothelial cells. The modulation consists  of phenotypic switches from a polygonal cell shape to a fibroblastic morphology and from basement membrane collagen (type IV-rich)  synthesis  to fibrillar  collagen (type  I-rich)  synthesis.  Basic fibroblast growth  factor  (bFGF) supplemented  with  heparin  was  able  to  induce effects identical to those of CEMF (333), thus a subsequent study examined whether bFGF was the direct mediator for corneal endothelium modulation and whether CEMF played a role in inducing bFGF production (334). Neither  exogenous bFGF nor  CEMF alone caused induction  of  bFGF mRNA in corneal endothelial cells,  but simultaneous treatment with bFGF and  CEMF selectively enhanced the 4.9-kb transcripts  encoding bFGF (334). When protein synthesis was inhibited by cycloheximide,  bFGF synthesis  was blocked in the presence of CEMF,  and as a consequence corneal endothelium modulation was inhibited. Furthermore, bFGF antisense oligonucleotides blocked by 50% the enhanced growth potential  mediated by bFGF induced with CEMF. Taken together, these findings suggested that de now synthesis of bFGF induced by CEMF is required for corneal endothelium  modulation (334).

Culture medium or homogenates of casein-induced rat peritoneal PM Ns were shown to induce markedly the production  of collagenase and PGE2 by  normal  synovid cells. Collagenase activity and  PGEe induction  were abolished by IL-la-neutralizing antibodies and PMN-derived culture medium  contained  relatively  small amounts  of  IL-la (335). However, the effects induced in synovial cells by recombinant  rat  IL-la were less than those induced by rat PMN culture medium. A combination of endogenous IL-la-deleted PMN-derived supernatant and recombinant IL-la restored the  synovial cell  collagenase and  PGEe production  to  the  levels  of  the original PMN-derived culture medium (335), thus proving that PMN culture medium contained not only IL-la, but also an additional factor syner-

gizing with  IL-la (335). This new factor, which was subsequently shown to be a negatively charged  protein  of about 80 kDa  (ruling out that  is  a member of the IL-6 or epidermal growth factor families) (335), may have important roles in connective tissue destruction and chronic inflammation in  diseases such as rheumatoid  arthritis.

Inflammatory neutrophils  collected from  rat peritoneal  exudates were shown to secrete a factor with hepatocyte-stimulating activity (HSF) (336); this factor induced a2-macroglobulin (a2M)  synthesis  in primary rat hepatocytes (337). Unfortunately, it was not assessed whether HSF corresponds to IL-6. Various other studies showed that inflammatory PMNs collected from the pleural cavity of rats released factors that enhanced the phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-induced proliferative response of normal lymph node cells  or  thymocytes (338). These  lymphocyte-stimulating activities were found in PMN supernatants and in their lysates, and were significantly upregulated  following pretreatment  of  neutrophils with  Con  A (338, 339). However, the nature of the latter activities (338,  339) and of other similar factors (340-344) was not further elucidated.

## Q.  NEUTHOPHINS

Laurenzi et al. (345) examined the expression of neurotrophin and neurotrophin  receptor  mRNA in  human  granulocytes and bone  marrow cells. By RPA and RT-PCR,  granulocytes were found to express constitutively mRNA encoding nerve growth factor (NGF),  brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF),  and neurotrophin-4 (NT-4),  but not neurotrophin-3 (NT3). Expression of NT-4 (but not NGF or BDGF) mRNA was specifically up-regulated by LTB4 (345). Whether the reported accumulation of neurotrophin  mRNA was  accompanied by  the  synthesis of  the corresponding proteins was not investigated. Such information is  urgently required.

## R.  CYTOKINES  AT ARE  NOT  PRODUCED NEUTHOPHILS TH BY

Human  neutrophils  do not  produce  RANTES, MCP-2,  MCP-3, or I309 (25), IL-2 (233), or  IL-10  or  IL-13 (50, 309,  346). A  very elegant demonstration was actually provided in the case of IL-10 and IL-13 (50). Human PMNs, purified by inimunomagnetic depletion of class II-positive cells, were found unable to synthesize, store, or release  IL-10 and IL-13 in numerous activatory  conditions. Various stimuli were utilized: LPS and/ or TNF-a with or without IFN-.)I  or GM-CSF, fMLP, PAF, LTB4,  PMA, opsonized or unopsonized zymosan, IL-lp, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10,  IL-4,  IL13, TGF-P,  OSM, leukemia  inhibitory  factor,  and  keratinocyte  growth factor, all of which were used  for up to 72 hr.  Lack of  IL-10 and  IL-13 production  was  confirmed  by  the  absence  of  IL-10  and  IL-13  mRNA expression by  RT-PCR.  The addition of  protease  inhibitors, which was

used  to  detect  IL-10  in  supernatants  of  stimulated  murine  neutrophils (292, 292), did not allow the detection of  IL-10 in  human PMN cultures (50).  This was consistent with clinical studies on patients with acute distress respiratory  syndrome (ARDS), in which alveolar PMN culture supernatants contained no IL-10 (347).  Very importantly, however, studies performed with  PMN  suspensions isolated by  means of  classical  methods  (dextran sedmentation followed by Ficoll centrifugation) and containing  1 to 2% of inonocytes  and lymphocytes  showed detectable production of  L-10 and 1 IL-13 (50). The latter experiments  might  explain some reports  of (348) the  presence  of IL-10  in supernatants  from  LPS-stimulated  PMNs, whereby IL-10 plays a negative role in the regulation of prostanoid production induced by LPS.

## IV. Production of Cytokines by Neutrophils Isolated from Individuals Affected by Different Pathologies

Investigations on  the  capacity of  neutrophils  to  produce  cytokines in human  pathological  conditions  are  not  as  numerous a s those  regarding mononuclear cells. Because neutrophils  are  abundant  in  the  circulation and are readily accessible  to experimental investigations,  more inform  a  t'  on i will  likely  appear in  the  future.  A  concise description  of  what  has  been reported to date is presented below.

## A.  PROI)U(:TION OF IL-8 IN VAIIlOUS DISEASES

Some researchers have examined the capacity of  PMNs to produce IL8  in the context of various diseases. Kuhns et nl. (349)  observed that during the  evolution of  the  inflammatory response  associated with  skin lesions raised by suction, IL-8 reached levels up to 175  n g h l   in the media bathing of  the exudative neutrophils at this inflammatory site (63).  These neutrophils exhibited loo-fold greater levels of cell-associated  IL-8, and spontaneously released  up  to  SO-fold  more  IL-8 than  freshly isolated peripheral blood  neutrophils  from  the  same  donors  (63). These  data  indicate  that neutrophils  migrating to  an  inflammatory focus have  up-regulated  their production of  IL-8, suggesting that, by releasing IL-8, PMNs may play a relevant role in  the autocrine  regulation of  the inflammatory response. the lesions.  Accumulation of IL-8 strictly correlated with the accumul*  t' rl 1011

Neutrophils  isolated  from  the  sputum  of  patients  with  cystic  fibrosis (CF)  were  found to release elevated amounts of  IL-8 and nitrite, PMNs from the  sputum  of  subjects with  active disease were  more  active than corresponding  cells  from  stable  subjects  (350). Accordingly, significant levels of  IL-8 and nitrite were present in the  soluble phase of sputuni of CF subjects, once again  at  much  higher  levels in  subjects with  disease

exacerbation (350). IL-8 and  nitric  oxide  produced  by  neutrophils  and other  cells could  therefore  represent  novel  therapeutic  targets  to  block lung damage  in  CF. Accordingly, long-term  erythromycin treatment  of patients  affected  by  chronic  airway  disease  (CAD) have  proved  to  be effective,  due to a moderate inhibitory effect of the drug on the production of IL-8  by Pseudoirzonas-stiiriulated neutrophils ( 1 15). Involvement  of PMNs as mediators of lung injury in the pathogenesis of pulmonary complications associated with cocaine abuse has been supported by  Baldwin et al. ( 8 5 ) , who  investigated whether  controlled in uiuo administration  of cocaine altered the function of neutrophils. It was found that exposure to cocaine in uiuo enhanced  the  antibacterial  and  antitumor  activities  of PMNs, but also potentiated their ability to release IL-8 (85).

The role of IL-8 in inducing neutrophil accumulation in the nasal discharge  of  patients  with  chronic  sinusitis  was  examined  by  Suzuki  and colleagues (351 ). Chronic sinusitis is  a common  inflammatory paranasal sinus  disease, clinically characterized  by  edematous  hypertrophy  of  the paranasal mucosa and persistent  purulent  nasal discharge and paranasal sinus effusion with selective and vigorous recruitment of neutrophils.  By immunohistochemistry  IH) and ( in situ hybridization, the researchers  examined specimens obtained from two groups of patients, those with chronic sinusitis and those with allergic rhinitis. The IL-8 levels in nasal discharge were  significantly higher in  the chronic sinusitis group compared to the allergic rhinitis  group (351). Immunoreactivity to  IL-8 was  observed  in emigrated  PMNs  from  nasal  smears,  in  nasal  gland  duct  cells,  and  in epithelial cells of the chronic sinusitis group, whereas those of the allergic rhinitis  group  mostly  showed  little  or  no  reaction.  Similar  patterns  of localization were shown by ISH for IL-8 mHNA. The results of Suzuki et al. (351) suggest that chemotactic factors in  sinus effusion, including IL8 derived  from  nasal  gland  duct  cells  and  epithelial  cells,  first  attract neutrophils out of  the mucosa, and then neutrophils that have emigrated into the sinus effusion secrete IL-8. This might induce a further neutrophil accumulation in the sinus of  chronic sinusitis patients.

Though  another  article  confirms that  neutrophils  from  asthmatic  or atopic  dermatitis  patients  do  not  express  significantly more  IL-8  than control neutrophils (352), a  different study  showed  that PMNs isolated from the sputum of subjects with bronchiectasis produced elevated amounts of IL-8, IL-lp, and, to a lesser extent, TNF-a (353). In the latter situation, an autocrine loop involving IL-1p was responsible for the maintenance of IL-8 production by PMNs within the bronchus lumen (353).

Lin and Huang evaluated the IL-8 gene expression  and release by PMNs and peritoneal macrophages (PMs)  during peritonitis caused by S. aureus, in  uremic patients  on continuous ambulatory peritoneal  dialysis (CAPD)

(354). Their previous study indicated  that  IL-8 was  detectable  in  clrain dialysate of  these  patients  during the  early acute  stage of  peritonitis,  at variable levels depending on tlie microorganism type (355). These authors revealed that both the IL-8  levels and tlie amount of IL-8 inRNA expression were highly correlated with the PMN count found in the drain dialysate, because  both  were  high  at  the  onset  of  peritonitis  and  then  decreased progressively (354). However, PMs expressed inore IL-8 inRNA than did PMNs. These data suggest that  through the  release of  IL-8, PMNs  may also be  considered  potential  contributors  to  the  pathogenesis  of  peritoneal injnry.

Different  groups  of  investigators (356, 357) examined the  expression of  neutrophil-specific chemoattractants  in  psoriatic  lesions.  Dense  focal accuinulation of neutrophils in the upper epidermis is a hallinark of psoriasis (358), but  tlie  signals for  neutrophil  diapedesis and  migration  in  tlie disease  are  not  fully  understood.  The  studies  provided  evidence  for a differential expression of  three neutrophil-attracting  cliemokines, namely IL-8, GRO-a, and  ENA-78.  ISEI  and  IH  of  serial  sections of  psoriatic lesions were  einployed to identify arid  localize the cells producing  these cliemokines.  A series of observations  were made. Along with keratinocytes, neutropliils residing in  microabscesses in tlie stratum corneuin expressed IL-8 messages at high levels (356). As opposed to IL-8, GRO-a was highly expressed by  single cells in  the  papillary  dermis  (vessel-associated cells and  infiltrating cells) (356, 357). GKO-a rnRNA expression was  highly vaiiable  and,  in  the  upper  epiderinidis, GRO-a and  IL-8  mKNA  were typically  coexpressed  by  clusters  of  keratiriocytes (356, 357). Though mRNA expression of the highly hoinologous chemokine ENA-78 was absent (357), focal  expression  of GRO-a and  IL-8  in  the  epidermis  was associated with  a  focal  infiltration  of  neutrophils (356, 3-57). However, GRO-a hybridization patterns did not correspond to the distribution patterns of  neutropliils, indicating that  neutrophils were not a major source for GRO-a (356, 357). Taken together, the data indicated that both  IL-8 and GRO-a are important  chemoattractants  for neutrophil  di. p  e  d  esis ' 1 in uiuo, and  that  migration of  neutrophils  and  formation  of  inicropustules appear to be influenced by the cooperative action of both IL-8 and GKO-a.

## B.  INFIAMMATORY  EL  DISEASE BOW

Neutrophils  are  important  cellular  inediators  in  inflammatory bowel diseases  IBDs) such as ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) ( (359). To visualize the  distribution of  IL-8 in  the intestinal  niucosa and to  understand  its possible role  in  tlie  induction  and  promotion  of  IBD, Mazzucchelli and  colleagues (360) analyzed tlie  expression of  the  IL-8 gene in resected bowel segments of 1 4 patients with active CD or UC. I n

situ hybridization revealed, in the affected mucosa, strong and specific IL8 signals that correlated with the histological grade of active inflammation. IL-%expressing  cells were mainly macrophages, neutrophils, and epithelial cells, and in  patients  with UC were diffusely distributed over the entire affected  mucosa,  whereas  in  patients  with  CD,  IL-8-expressing  cells showed a focal distribution  pattern (360). Neutrophils  very  likely represented the main IL-8-expressing cell population at the site of active IBD, at the base of ulcers, in  inflammatory exudates on the mucosal surfaces, in  crypt  abscesses, and  at  the  borders  of  fistulae (360). These  findings were in agreement with previous studies showing an association between increased IL-8 and myeloperoxidase levels in corresponding regions of the colonic IBD mucosa (361). IL-8 gene expression in uninflamed intestinal tissue resected for colon carcinoma and in inflamed colonic tissue resected from IBD was  also studied by  Grimm and colleagues (362). IL-8 mRNA was detected by ISH in macrophages and neutrophils adjacent to ulceration in inflamed bowel, as well as in many neutrophils in lamina propria, ulcer slough, and crypt abscesses, but was  not detected in uninflamed mucosa displaying intact epithelium or from carcinoma resections (362). IL-8 protein,  as  detected  by  IH, was  present  in  the  same  distribution  as  IL-8 mRNA. Recently recruited macrophages were also responsible for some of  this  IL-8  expression, whereas  epithelial cells in  normal  and inflamed tissue showed neither IL-8 message nor IL-8 protein. These data, further supported by other more recent findings (363, 364), suggest that neutrophils and recently recruited  macrophages are responsible for production of IL-8 in  IBD, and thus may trigger a mechanism for a continuing cycle of  neutrophil attraction and activation.

TNF-a and IL-1P are also implicated in the initiation and perpetuation of  intestinal inflammation in  IBD (365). Beil  and colleagues (366) used an ultrastructural immunogold morphologic and morphometric analysis to identify the  cellular  and  subcellular  sites of  TNF-a  in  colonic biopsies obtained from patients with CD. They found that neutrophils, in addition to  eosinophils,  macrophages,  mast  cells,  fibroblasts, and  epithelial  and Paneth  cells, expressed TNF-a. The  cytokine was  not  present  in  cytoplasmic granules of neutrophils, but it was associated with the membranes of Golgi structures and cytoplasmic vesicles, or in lipid bodies (366). More recently (346), PMNs isolated from blood of patients with IBD were shown to  release increased  levels of  TNF-a IL-1P, and IL-1RA in  response  to LPS compared to normal control neutrophils. The enhanced secretion of TNF-a and IL-1P did not appear to be specific for IBD because  PMNs from patients with infectious colitis also showed increased release of proinflammatory  cytokines (346). It was concluded that PMNs are an important source of proinflammatory cytokines in patients with intestinal inflamma-

tion, and therefore deserve more attention in the immunopathogenic mechanisms of  these diseases (346).

## c. NEUTH~P~IIL-DEHIVEI) CYTOKINES IN RHEUMATOID  RTIIRITIS A AND SYS'I'EMI(:  LUPUS EHYTIIEMATOSUS

Rheumatoid arthritis, a systemic autoimmune disease characterized  by chronic inflammation of  the  synovium, often leads to  the  destruction  of articular cartilage and juxtaarticular bone. Although the etiology of  RA is unknown, considerable evidence suggests that cytokines play a critical role in its pathogenesis (367).  In view of the fact that synovial  fluid from patients with active RA are heavily infiltrated with neutrophils (85-95% of the total cell population), several groups have investigated whether neutrophils can be a potential source of cytokines. PMNs possess the greatest capacity to induce cartilage degradation directly and therefore to act as mediators in the pathogenesis of  tissue damage observed in  HA (162).

Malyak et ul. (368),  found a very strong correlation between SF IL-1RA levels and the number of neutrophils present in these fluids. Synovial fluid PMNs contained preexisting IL-1P and  IL-1RA proteins  in  the b  sence of  detectable  mRNA,  and both  LPS  and  GM-CSF  induced  modest  increases in  IL-1P and  IL-1RA mRNA and protein  in cultured SF PMNs, as  well as  in  normal cultured  PMNs (368).  Thus, with  regard to the IL1P and IL-1RA proteins, PMNs isolated from inflammatory  SF were found to  be  qualitatively similar to  PMNs  from  normal peripheral blood,  and, therefore not to be activated in vivo. Interestingly, SF samples from patients  with  noninflammatory arthropathies  contained undetectable  levels of  IL-lRA, and therefore it was inferred that normal SF does not contain IL-1RA  (368). The  authors  therefore  concluded  that  neutrophils  might significantly contribute  to the total  IL-1RA levels in  SF in  patients  with active  RA.  The  ability  of  RA  blood-derived  and  SF-derived  PMNs  to produce  IL-la and IL-lp, in the absence or presence of  LPS, was also assessed by Dularay et nl. (229).  In contrast with the previous results (368), no production of IL-1P (or IL-la)  by SF PMNs was found, whereas blood PMNs from three of  eight  R A   patients  produced  IL-1. Opposite  results were  reported  also  by  Edwards  and  colleagues  (237, 369). This  group initially reported  that  in  RA  patients  SF  PMNs,  but  not  blood  PMNs, contained levels of  IL-lP mRNA ranging from 0.5 to 3% of the miuriinal levels that could be induced by  GM-CSF treatment  of  blood neutrophils (237). Subsequently,  they  detected  IL-10  mRNA  transcripts  in  Mood PMNs of patients with HA, at much greater levels than those detected in paired  SF PMNs  (369). In  contrast,  in  two  patients  with  seronegative arthritis  and  two  patients  with  ankylosing spondylitis, the  hybridization signals  for  IL-10  niRNA  in  the  blood  neutrophils  were  undetectable.

The results of  their  second study (369) implied that  activation of  IL-lP expression by PMNs in RA occurs in the circulation before the cells enter into diseased joints. As  a consequence, only a small subpopulation of  SF PMNs expressing IL-lP can be found at any moment, namely those that have been  most recently attracted into the inflamed joint.  More recently (244), the same group demonstrated that cell-free SF induced the synthesis of  IL-1P in neutrophils  isolated from fresh buffy coats. Both soluble and insoluble immune complexes, which are found in  RA  fluid, induced the synthesis of  IL-lP, but  very  little  of  this  cytokine  was  secreted (244). That neutrophils  isolated from the  SF of  patients with  RA  constitutively synthesize IL-1P has been observed by Jobin and Gauthier (253). IL-1P expression was considered to occur as the result of a neutrophil-neutrophil interaction  caused  by  the  high  cellular  density  observed  in  the  SF of patients with  RA  (ranging from 2 X 10Vml to 100 X 106/ml).

Contributing to the description of neutrophil-derived  cytokines in HA, Edwards's group showed that both RA  SF and blood PMNs express high levels  of  TGF-P1  but  no  TNF-a  mRNA (237), whereas  Taichman et al. (36) identified  VEGF  in  neutrophils  from  RA  synovial biopsies,  by immunohistochemical staining. Furthermore, Beaulieu and McColl (370) found RA SF PMNs to be Significantly  less efficient in producing IL-lRA, compared with  matched blood PMNs. The spontaneous or GM-CSF- or TNF-a-induced production of IL-1RA by SF neutrophils was significantly decreased when compared with blood neutrophils isolated from the same individuals. Under  the  same experimental conditions, production  of  IL1/3  and  IL-8  was  up-regulated,  suggesting that  there  was  not  a general down-regulation of  cell  function  in  SF PMNs.  These  results  were  also paralleled  by  a comparable  modulation  at  the  level of  cytokine mKNA expression (370). Beaulieu and McColl therefore concluded that neutrophils  are  likely to  be  an  important source of  IL-8 and  IL-1P  in  the  RA joint, but that SF neutrophils appear incapable of mounting a response as high  as that of blood neutrophils in terms of  IL-1RA production (370).

The potential role of neutrophil-derived chernokines to attract PM Ns to the SF was further investigated by Koch et al. (22), who found significantly greater levels of antigenic GRO-a in SF  from patients with RA as compared with osteoarthritis (OA)  or other noninflammatory arthritides. This GROa accounted  for 28% of the whole chemotactic activity for PMNs found in RA SF (22), suggesting that also GRO-a plays an important role in the migration of  PMNs into the inflamed RA joints. Both  RA SF PMNs and normal blood PMNs produced significant amounts of CKO-a,  either constitutively or after stimulation with  LPS (22). Therefore, production  of  IL8 (370), GRO-a (22), and likely more chemokines by neutrophils and other

cells  may  lead  to  the  recruitment  of  more  leukocytes to  the joint,  and therefore perpetuate  HA.

PMNs from patients with systemic  lupus erythematosus (SLE)  are known to exhibit several functional abnormalities that cause an increased susceptibility to infections (371), which is one of the hallmarks of SLE (372). Hsieh et ul. (373) found that the spontaneous and LPS-stimulated production of IL-8 by  the peripheral blood  PMNs of active SLE patients was impaired as  compared  to inactive SLE  or healthy individuals. This impaired  IL-8 production by SLE PMNs was not linked to the administration of steroids, because incubation of normal PMNs or inactive SLE PMNs with prednisolone for 24 hr did not significantly  affect IL-8 production (373). However, the  possibility that  a long-term  iininunosuppressive treatment  may  have led to defective IL-8 production in active SLE patients was not excluded. The same group also reported  that  the spontaneous  and LPS-stimulated production of IL-1RA by PMNs, but not by PBMCs, in patients with active SLE was significantly lower than that in patients with inactive SLE or in normal groups (374). This impaired  IL-1RA production  by  SLE  PMNs seemed, again, not linked to the administration of corticosteroids, because prednisolone did not affect the IL-1RA production of normal neutrophils i n vitro, either  spontaneously or after  LPS stimulation (374). Moreover, IL-1RA production  by  active  SLE  PMNs  increased  concomitantly with clinical and  laboratory  measures  of  improvement  after  effective clinical therapy,  but  not  in  the  patients  who  did  not  respond  to  the  treatment (374). Taken together, the results suggested that decreased IL-8 and IL1RA production  may  constitute  specific functional  defects  of  PMNs  in patients with  active SLE, and may predispose to infections and may  also be regarded as novel indicators of disease activity in  patients with active SLE.  However, a  more  recent  study  in  which  SLE  patients  were  not taking any antirheumatic or immunosuppressive medications (375) partially contradicts the  latter  findings (374), because  only in  inonocytes of  SLE patients was IL-1KA production somewhat lower than in normal individuals.  Furthermore,  no  significant  difference  between  SLE  patients  and controls was found in the production of IL-lP by neutrophils or inonocytes after  LPS  stimulation (375). The ratio of  IL-1RNIL-1 production  from neutrophils and  inonocytes was  also not different  for lupus patients  and normal donors (375).

IL-1P is  one of  the  genes that  appear to play  an  essential role  in  the pathogenesis of sepsis syndrome (376). McCall's group reported that circulating  PMNs  of  patients  with  sepsis syridroine  (sepsis-PMNs) were, in uitro, tolerant  to endotoxin-induced expression of  the  IL-lP gene (377).

This tolerance consisted of a combined reduction in LPS-stimulated levels of  IL-10 mRNA and a decreased synthesis of the immunoreactive IL-1P protein. It was excluded that the mechanisms responsible for the tolerance of  sepsis-PMNs were  due to  the  loss  of  the  CD14  surface protein,  the receptor required for endotoxin-mediated gene induction in PMNs (180), or that they were the result of a global reduction in the functional responses of  PMNs (377).  The down-regulation of  the IL-1P gene in  sepsis-PMNs occurred concomitantly  with an up-regulation of the constitutive expression ofthe  type I1 IL-1 receptor  IL-1RII) (378),  and did not persist in PMNs of ( patients recovering from the sepsis syndrome. Tolerance involved specific signal transduction pathways triggered by LPS, because sepsis-PM  Ns normally synthesized IL-lP in  response  to  S. cmreus, and  secreted elastase (377).  Interestingly, tolerance was not limited to infection by gram-negative bacteria, but was also observed when sepsis was induced by gram-positive bacteria, Rickettsia, Candicla species, or staphylococcal exotoxins, and not in  patients  seriously ill without detectable infection.

In agreement with these findings, the release of IL-8 by PMNs isolated from patients with sepsis was also significantly reduced whether activated by LPS or by heat-killed streptococci (108). Similar results were obtained by  studying neutrophils  of  patients  who had  undergone cardiac  surgery with  cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), a condition that provokes a sort of inflammatory stress (108). I n   vitro experiments  demonstrated  that  the observed  diminished  neutrophil  ability to  produce  IL-8  did  not  reflect an  endotoxin tolerance  effect stricto  sensu, because  LPS was  unable  to desensitize the cells to a second challenge by LPS, as reported for monocytes (379). However, pretreatment  of  PMNs with  IL-10  rendered  the cells less reactive to a subsequent stimulation with LPS (108), suggesting that  IL-10 may  have  been  responsible for the  observed down-regulated capacity to produce  IL-8 in those patients.

In  addition to circulating IL-8, high levels of cell-associated IL-8 were also detected in blood samples from patients with sepsis (380).  Other than erythrocytes, already known as a"sink'  for IL-8 (381)  PMNs and PBMCs were found to contribute substantially to the detection  of  cell-associated IL-8 (380).  These findings  were not surprising, because we (124) and others (63)  had previously shown that cell-associated  IL-8 is indeed measurable in neutrophils either in vitro (124) or in vivo (63).  Strikingly,  in sepsis  patients the  amount  of  IL-8  associated with  PMNs on a per cell basis was  twice that found with PBMCs, and 3000 times that found in erythrocytes (380). Taking into account the relative number of circulating cells, 78.592% of the detectable cell-associated IL-8 in blood was thus linked to PMNs.

The analysis of cell-associated  cytokines was extended to another component  of  the  inflammatory response,  IL-lRA, which  also  can  exist  as  an

intracellular  form (254). Cell-associated IL-1RA was  detected  in  septic patients (380). However, in contrast to IL-8, the levels of cell-associated IL-1HA were not always higher than those of  circulating IL-1RA. What is more, IL-8 and IL-1RA mRNA were detected in PBMCs and PMNs from some septic patients and from some healthy controls, thus illustrating that circulating cells can  contribute  to  the  production  of  both  IL-8 and  IL1RA (380). The authors  concluded  that  measurement  of  cell-associated proinflammatory and  antiinflaminatory cytokines  in  sepsis  patients  is  a more reliable reflection of their production than is the simple measurement in  plasma.

Adult periodontitis is a chronic infectious disease associated with active tissue damage. PMNs usually constitute the great majority (&gt;95%) f cells o in  gingival crevicular fluid  (GCF) obtained  froin  gingival inflammation. Furthermore, in GCF, it is possible to reveal, with considerable frequency, significant levels of both  IL-1 and TNF-a (382). Whether PMNs derived from adult periodontitis could express cytokine genes in oivo was investigated  by  Takeichi  and  colleagues (52). Significant levels  of  biologically active IL-la and IL-1P, but  not TNF-a or IL-6, were found in  GCF of adult periodontitis patients (52).  In addition, by using RT-PCR  associated with a slot-blot analysis,  they provided elegant evidence that highly purified PMNs (&gt;99.5%)  collected from GCF express IL-la, IL-10, and TNF-a messenger  RNA,  but  not  IL-6  transcripts (52). Takahashi et $. (383) examined by ISH the IL-1P mRNA-expressing cells in GCF hiirvested at 15 diseased sites from five patients with adult periodontitis and 8 clinically periodontal healthy sites from three volunteers.  ISH showed IL-1P transcripts in  both  PMNs and MNCs, but  not in  epithelial cells, in  all  GCF samples from  diseased  and  healthy  sites. The  latter  was  not  surprising, because a sinall  inflaininatory reaction  to  bacterial  plaque  is  constantly present even in clinically  healthy sites. PMNs were the predominant leukocytes in diseased and healthy sites, and the percentages or IL-lP mRNApositive PMNs in GCF samples from diseased and healthy sites were 92.3 and  80.996, respectively. Besides,  the  mean  amounts  of  IL-1P  inRNA expression in  PMNs were higher compared to MNCs in  all samples and there  was  heterogeneity  within  the populations of  PMNs  and  MNCs in their ability to express the IL-lP gene (383). These findlngs indicated that IL-1P  is  predominantly  produced  by  PMNs  in  the  gingival  crevice  of patients with adult periodontitis and in healthy controls. In line with these observations, Hendley et nl. (231) showed that freshly obtained oral PMNs accuniulated IL-1P mRNA and released the soluble cytokine after 3 hr of

culture,  but  failed  to  respond  to  further  stimulation with  GM-CSF.  In contrast, peripheral PMNs cultured in the absence of stimulus did produce this  cytokine, but  responded  well  to  GM-CSF (231). Furthermore,  the amount of IL-lP produced by oral PMNs was strikingly greater than that produced  by  circulating PMNs in vitru (231).

The same group confirmed the observations on IL-1P in a larger number of cases (40  patients with adult periodontitis and 40 orally healthy matched controls)  and  extended  the  study  to  include  the  production  of  TNF-a (164). They found that oral PMNs released considerable amounts of IL1P and TNF-a, but there was no difference between patients and controls when the cytokine levels were corrected for cell number. However, when the effect of disease activity  was examined, cytokine release by oral PMNs was found to be greater in patients with advanced disease (164). No accumulation of mRNA for either IL-lP or TNF-a was  demonstrable  in  oral PMNs  that  had  been  cultured  for 3 hr (164), whereas  freshly purified neutrophils expressed both  messages ( 1   4, 231). 6 Interestingly, within the healthy control group,  IL-1P production  by  oral PMNs was  significantly higher  in  males, but  no effect  of  race  on  cytokine production  could  be discerned in patients or controls (164). Examination of IL-lP production by  peripheral  blood  PMNs exposed to  GM-CSF revealed no difference between the patient and control groups. In contrast, IL-lD production by peripheral blood PMNs was significantly  reduced in patients with advanced periodontitis (164). Finally, evidence that PMNs in inflammatory  periradicular  tissues  may  be  a  significant source  of  IL-la  and  IL-1P has  been further generated  by  Miller et al. (384). Cell suspensions from  selected periapical granuloma specimens, as well as from purified peripheral blood PMNs and PBMCs, were subjected to IL-1 quantitation using an ELISA procedure. Such cell suspensions were found to produce significant levels of IL-1 and could be stimulated to produce increased levels after coculture with LPS. They have also found a positive staining for IL-6 in a subpopulation  (15-2096)  of  neutrophils  resident  in  inflamed periradicular  lesions (274).

Because a marked variation in  cytokine production  among individuals was discovered (164,  383), Galbraith and colleagues started to investigate a possible association betweep TNF-a genotype and the level of TNF-a production by oral PMN's obtaining promising preliminary results (385). Whether a particular TNF genotype is a risk factor for severity of disease in  adult periodontitis is  an interesting working hypothesis.

The levels of  expression of  some chemokines have been evaluated by Tonetti et al. (386), who performed in s i t u hybridization of IL-8 and MCP1  genes in frozen tissue sections from patients affected by adult periodontal infections. M,aximal IL-8 expression  was found in the  junctional epithelium

adjacent to the infecting microorganisms  where PMN infiltration was more prominent,  whereas MCP-1 was  expressed  in  the  chronic  inflairimatory infiltrate ant1 along the basal layer of the oral epithelium where only cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage were present (386). These topographically specific  tissue locations of chemokine mRNA expression were consistent  with a hypothetical  establishment of  a discrete  chemotactic  source for an effective leukocyte recruitment. The pattern of  IL-8 production in gingiva observed by Tonetti et nl. (386) was quite different from what was observed  in  patients  affected  by  rapidly progressive periodontitis  (RPP) (387). The latter disease is  a rapid and destructive form of  periodontitis, which typically emerges in the late second or third decade of life, and that is characterized by a massive infiltration of PMNs in inflammatory gingival sites (388). High IL-8 plasma levels as well as strong IL-8 niRNA expression in  both  epithelial  kind  connective  gingival  cells  from  patients  with  RPP was  found (387). Moreover, the gingival PMNs contained  IL-8 mRNA, suggesting an autoamplification of PMN recruitment and activation in the gingiva. In  ddition, resting  PMNs  of  RPP patients  showed  rednced  Lselectin, Lewis x, and sialyl Lewis x antigen expression as well as increased H202  production (387). PMNs showed a lack of increased response ( H 2 0 2 production) to  formyl peptitles  after ex uiuo priming with  IL-8, possibly was  accompanied by  normalization of  IL-8 values, PMN  oxidative burst, and PMN priming by IL-8, suggesting a link among these features of the disease  in  which  PMN-derived  IL-8  is  probably  self-amplifymg (387). These modifications of PMN adhesion molecule expression, together with their  increased basal  oxidative burst and excessive IL-8 production,  may contribute  to  the  noxious inflairiinatory reaction,  which  may  in  turn  tie autopotentiated by  PMN production  of  IL-8. caused by IL-8 desensitization.

Chronic apical periodontitis  is  an  infectious  disease,  characterized  by granuloma formation and progressive bone resorption  around the apex of the tooth. IL-la, IL-lD, and TNF-a are known to induce osteoblastic hone resorption,  inhibit  tmne  formation in uitro, and decrense bone  collagm synthesis. Based  on  previous evidence that  PMNs derived from  chronic inflamed tissues can produce proinflammatory cytokines (52), Takeichi ct (11  (1 78) characterized the ability  of alveolar  bone-derived PMNs to produce proinflammatory cytokines. High concentrations of  IL-la, IL-lP, ant1 IL6, but not of TNF-a,  were detected in periapical exudates (PEs),  collected from perinpical lesions with chronic periapical periodontitis  through  root canals (178). Because the PE contains predominiintly 1'MNs  with a sinull percentage  of  lymphocytes and/or macrophages, the  latter were piiiifietl and analyzed for cytokine inHNA expression using a cytokine-specific HTPCH. Highly purified PMNs isolated from PEs expressed significant levels

of  mRNA for IL-la, IL-10, and TNF-a. IL-6 mRNA was not detected, despite a high concentration of IL-6 detected in supernatants of PEs (178), likely deriving  from macrophages,  T lymphocytes,  osteoblasts,  or fibroblasts around periapical lesions.  These data strongly  suggested that human PMNs derived from alveolar  bone spontaneously  produce IL-la, IL-10, and TNFa at sites of inflammation, and probably initiate inflammation and regulate augmentation of bone resorption in uivo.

To determine  the  cytokine-producing cells  during  the  early and  late stages  of shigellosis,  Raqib  et al. (389) examined, by immunohistochemistry, cryopreserved tissues from Shigella-infected patients. Shigella infection is usually accompanied by an intestinal activation of epithelial cells, T cells, and macrophages within the inflamed colonic mucosa. Histopathologically, Shigella infection is characterized by the presence of chronic inflammatory cells with  or without  neutrophils  and  microulcers in  the lamina propria, crypt distortion, and, less frequently, crypt abscess. Raqib and co-workers found that Shigella-infected patients  had significantly higher numbers of cytokine-producing cells for all the cytokines studied (IL-la(/P, IL-lRA, IL-4,  IL-6,  IL-8,  IL-10,  IFN-7,  TNF-a, lymphotoxin-a,  TGF-01, -02, and -03), compared to healthy controls. However,  production of the various cytokines in rectal biopsies during acute and convalescent periods was not significantly different, with  the exceptions of TGF-0 and  IL-1RA (389). In  the  acute  Shigella  infection, the  PMNs  present  in  the  crypt  abscess were clearly seen to contain IL-10 (389). This observation is  revelant in view of  the  evidence that  IL-1 is  a key player in  the cascade mediating invasion and inflammation by  Shigella of  the intestinal mucosa (390).

Meningitis is  an  acute inflammatory disease of  the pia  and arachnoid and the fluid in the  subarachnoid space. Meningitis is  accompanied by a differential  immigration of  leukocytes into  the  subarachnoid  space,  but the mechanisms regulating leukocyte invasion during meningitis are still incompletely understood. Obviously, chemokines may represent the major chemoattractant stimuli for the differential recruitment of leukocytes into the subarachnoid space during meningitis. To better understand the role of chemokines, Sprenger and colleagues (391) analyzed 48 paired cerebrospinal  fluid (CSF) and serum samples from patients hospitalized for meningitic symptoms. Very high  levels of  IL-8, GRO-a, and  MCP-1 were detected in  the CSF during bacterial and nonbacterial  meningitis, whereas MIP-la and RANTES were below detection limits. In contrast, the levels of chemokines in the blood serum samples were not elevated (391). The levels of  IL-8  and  GRO-a  in  the  CSF significantly correlated with  the

immigrated granulocytes in the CSF of patients with bacterial meningitis. A  similar  correlation  between  MCP-I  levels  and  the  mononuclear  cell count in  nonbacterial meningitis was found (391).

In another work, protein concentration and inKNA expression of TNFa and TGF-P1 in the CSF of23  patients with bacterial or viral irieningitis were investigated (392). High  amounts  of  cytokines (especially of  TNFa) at  both  protein  and  inRNA levels were  detected  in  bacterial a s well viral infections (392). A preponderance of TNF-a coinpared  to TCF-P1 inRNA  was  visible  in CSF cells  of  patients  with  bacterial  meningitis, whereas a halaiice of  TNF-a and TGF-P1 mKNA or a higher expression of  TGF-P1 mKNA was detected in viral meningitis. Surprisingly, in  the acute-phase bacterial meningitis, but even in viral infections, neutrophils expressed  more  TNF-a and  TGF-P1  mHNA  than  did  lymphocytes or inonocytes/inacropliages,  which instead dominated cytokine synthesis during  the  healing phase.  TNF-a and  TCF-01  inHNA  were  expressed  by neutrophils at tlie time of  significant clinical worsening (392).

Finally,  PMNs  from  injured  patients  with  elevated Caizdida antigen titers were evaluated for their ability to activate the anticandidal functions and  to  produce  TNF-a  and  IL-8  (393).  Though  PMNs  demonstrated impaired function against C alhictins growth when compared with PM Ns from injury-matched controls, cytokine  production and autocrine activation remained intact (393),  demonstrating that the PMN dysfunction in these patients is  not  global.

Investigations by  ultrastnictural  localization of  HGF in  tissue samples obtained from control subjects and patients affected by acute and chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis revealed that, in  addition to biliary epithelial cells, PMNs represented a source of circulating HGF ( 4 9 ) . However, the number of  PMNs stained for  HCF in  the liver from patients with acute liepatitis was  not  greater  than  that  from  control  subjects,  probably  twciiiise  tlie specimens were obtained from recovering patients  (40). Electron  microscopy confirmed that the immunostained cells with segmented nuclei were polymolylionuclear leukocytes and  that  the  stained  grains werv  on  tlic membranes of rough endoplasmic reticulum, around specific or miropliilic granules. It was therefore proposed that PMNs corrld produce IiGF driiing liver regeneration, and this cytokine, in  tnm, may  affect liepatocyte and biliary epithelid cell proliferation (324).

Bortolami and colleagues assessed the effect of different doses of  IFNa on the production of TNF-a by resting and LPS-activated huinan neotrophils  from  normal and hepatitis  C virus  (HCV)-infected patients (394).

The results revealed that  non  of  the  IFN-a concentrations  (25-5000  U/ ml)  alone induced TNF-a from  PMNs, and that  TNF-a production  by PMNs  after  LPS  stimulation  was  similar  in  normal  and  HCV-infected patients. However, IFN-a associated with LPS induced a marked increase in TNF-a secretion by PMNs from HCV-infected patients, but had minimal effects on PMNs from healthy controls (394).  The data uncovered a new biological  property  of  IFN-a, which  may  be  taken  into  account  during therapy for  HCV-related chronic hepatitis.

Cassone's group reported  that  neutrophils  from  HIV-infected ( HIV' ) patients were able to synthesize amounts of  IL-1P and IL-6 comparable to those made by neutrophils  from healthy subjects, suggesting that cells from HIV'  patients were good responders to activating signals (245).  More recently, their analysis of tht.  ability of neutrophils from AIDS patients to produce cytokines was numerically extended  (13, 102). IL-1P, IL-6,  IL8, and TNF-a production bv PMNs from 21 HIV'  patients, including 11 with full-blown AIDS, and 20 HIV-uninfected (HIV-) subjects (matched for age and  sex to HIV+ suhjects) was studied by  HT-PCH  and ELISA. In all  subjects, cytokine gene expression was strongly stiinulated by  MPF2 or LPS, and inhibited by  IL-10 (13,  102).  In these studies, PMNs from HIV' subjects  showed increased  IL-6  and  TNF-a gene expression and produced more IL-6 and TNF-a than did PMNs from HIV- controls (13, 102). Quantitatively similar expression  of  IL-1P  transcripts,  as  well  as production of IL-1P and IL-8 proteins, was observed in  cells from  HIV' and HIV- subjects (13, 102.

We also investigated the  ability of neutrophils isolated from  HIV' pitients to produce proinflammatory cytokines (290).  We determined the in oitro responsiveness of  PMNs and PBMCs to LPS, used in the presence or absence of  IFN-y, in  47 HIV' patients  with  advanced stages of  virus infection. Release of TNF-a and IL-8 from HIV'  PMNs was found to he higher  than  that  from  normal  PMNs.  Conversely, release  of  IL-10 and IL-1RA in response to LPS, or to LPS plus IFN-y, was found to be lower in  PMNs froin HIVt  patients than that from controls. The release of IL12 induced by LPS, or by LPS plus IFN-y, did not significantly differ for PMNs from HIV'  patients and healthy donors. For all the cytokines, the capacity of IFN-y to modulate their production was not modfied in HIV' patients.  However, the  production  of  TNF-a and  IL-12 in  response  to LPS, or to LPS plus IFN-y, was found to be significantly  higher in PBMCs isolated froin HIV'  patients, whereas the release of IL-lP  was significantly lower. In the case of IL-8, no statistically significant difference was  found for PBMCs isolated from HIV'  patients and healthy donors (290).  Collectively, Cassone's  group data and ours suggest that in  HIV' patients  with advanced stages of disease, the ability of PMNs (and PBMCs) to produce

specific cytokines in response to LPS is significantly  altered, and this might condition the evolution of HIV disease.

Clinical and experimental studies from Jablonska et nl. (273, 395, 396) have focused on the measurement of cytokines  by neutrophils and PRMCs from  breast  cancer  patients.  The  authors  found  significant  differences concerning the parameters examined for PMNs and PRMCs from cancer patients as coinpared with normal individuals (395).  Neutrophils of cancer patients stimulated with zylnosan and LPS were found to produce significantly lower amounts of TNF-a as compared to PMNs of healthy controls (396). Conversely, neutrophils  isolated from  patients  with  breast  cancer displayed an'increased' capacity to constitutively produce  IL-6 as  compared to controls, but did not respond to a further stimulation with LPS or zyinosan (273). However, in this latter study, extremely high  levels of IL-6 were released by  resting neutrophils froin normal or patient donors (273).  In line  with these results, another group has reported that neutrophils isolated from patients with early oral carcinoma produce IL-6 and IL-lP in  response  to OK-432, but,  again, at  levels  so  elevated  that  they  were coinparable to those found in  autologous PBMCs (246). Finally, Ericson and colleagues (27S) have reported that circulating neutrophils  from  patients with metastatic breast  cancers undergoing  G-CSF therapy  express detectable levels of IL-6 mKNA by RT-PCH,  as well as detectable intracellular  IL-6 protein  (15 pg/ml)  (275). Cross-linking FcyHI  or  FcyRII  on these G-CSF-treated PMNs resulted in a synergistic  increase in the amount of  secreted IL-6 (275).

## V.  Modulation of Cytokine Production in Human Neutrophils

An important aspect that has emerged from many studies is that cytokine expression in neutrophils often changes as a  consequence ofthe'furictioiia1' state of  these cells at the inoment of receiving the stimulus. Various types of inflammatory or immunomodulating agents can positively or negatively affect the functional responses of neutrophils, including the prodiiction of cytokines (397).  The mechanisms whereby cytokine productioii is potentiated or down-regulated are (in most cases) still a mystery, the elucidation of  which  is  rendered  even  more  difficult by  the  fact  that  these  inimunomodulating agents, usually, but not  always, do not  directly trigger any response in neiitrophils. Though IFN-y and IL-10 represent the best studied examples, other cytokines (or experimental conditions) have been described to modulate neutrophilic cytokine production, as outlined below.

## A.  EFFECTS F IFNy O

As evidenced in Table VI, IFN-y mainly potentiates the production  of cytokines  by neutrophils. This up-regulation occurs regardless of the agonist used,  and is especially evident after long incubation times  (i.e., 16 hr or more). In particular,  the  LPS-elicited secretion of  TNF-a and IL-1P, as well  as  the TNF-a-stimulated release of  IL-lP, are  markedly enhanced by  IFN-y (224). Under  some  circumstances  however, IFN-y  exerts  an inhibitory effect toward neutrophil-derived  cytokine production.  For  instance, preincubation of PMNs with IFN-y significantly  inhibits the release of IL-8 after 2 hr of stimulation with fMLP or Y-IgG (77).  Similarly, IFNy inhibits the  early production  of  IL-8 induced  by  LPS  or TNF-a, but augments the release of  IL-8 at later time points (124, 179).  An  identical biphasic action of IFN-y has been observed in the case of MIP-la,  MIP-lp, and GRO-a release in LPS-stimulated neutrophils (21, 2 79).  Importantly, Northern  blot analyses have revealed that  these various effects of  IFN-y are paralleled by corresponding changes at the level of  cytokine (TNF-a and IL-1p) or chemokine (IL-8,  MIP-la,  MIP-1P, and GRO-a)  mRNA expression.

Other studies confirm that treatment of human  neutrophils with  IFNy and LPS for 20 hr  markedly increases the production  of  TNF-a over that of neutrophils treated with LPS alone (50,  70, 1 398), and have further extended  this  priming  effect  on  the  release  of  TNF-a  to  IFN-y  used in  combination  with  GM-CSF  (50).  Moreover, the  addition  of  sodium nitroprusside  (SNP), an  exogenous source  of  nitric oxide, together  with

N-acetylcysteine (NAC),  which increases the bioavailability  of nitric oxide, was shown to further potentiate the IFN-y plus  LPS-induced TNF-a and IL-8 secretion over a 20-hr period  of  incubation (72, 398). It  should be noted that exposure of  LPS-treated  PMNs to SNP or SNP phis NAC, but not to NAC done, also increased the production of TNF-a (398) and IL8 (72),  as compared with  exposure to  LPS  alone.  Interestingly,  though the  up-modulation  of  IL-8 production  was  associated with  an  increased expression of  LPS-induced  IL-8 mRNA (72), this  was  not  the case with TNF-a (398). The potential effect of nitric oxide on  LPS-induced TNFa and IL-8 production by human neutrophils may represent a mechanism by which endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells can augment the activation state of neutrophils as the latter migrate from the blood to sites of infection.  It  may  also  represent  a  novel  way  by  which  nitric  oxide regulates chemotactic  responses. Conversely, these responses  could also contribute  to  the  cytokine-mediated tissue  injury and  organ  Failure  observed during systemic infections.

The modulatory actions of IFN-y affect also the expression of IL-IHA. We  have  demonstrated  that  in  LPS-stimulated  neutrophils,  IFN-y  increases the  production  of  IL-1RA by enhancing  the  release  of de  riovosynthesized  IL-lRA,  without  modifying  IL-1RA  mHNA  accumulation (248). We also observed that  in  response to fMLP (10 nM), neutrophils released small but significant amounts of  IL-1RA: following IFN-y treatment, this fMLP-elicited IL-1HA production was greatly potentiated and was accompanied by a transient up-regulation of IL-  1  RA mRNA accumulation (248). In contrast, IL-1P protein was undetectable in culture supernatants  from  neutrophils  stimulated with  fMLP (248), even though  an  increased accumulation of IL-lP mRNA was noticed under these conditions (5).  Furthermore, prior  treatment  of  granulocytes with  IFN-.)I enhanced the  IgCi-opsonized yeast particle-induced  IL-1RA formation, but only at late times of incubation. Under all conditions tested, IFN-y by itself failed to exert any detectable effect toward gene expression and release of  IL1RA or IL-lP (248). It therefore appears that, depending on  the type of stimulus  used,  IFN-y  enhances  IL-1RA  production  by  acting  through different  mechanisms.

The ability of  IFN-.)I  to  modulate cytokine production  by  PMNs may have important implications in vivo. For instance, the ability of IFN-.)I  to up-regulate  cytokine and cheinokine production  by neutrophils  exposed to provocative doses of LPS might be one of the key factors contributing to the pathogenesis of  endotoxic shock (399). It might also represent  one of  the  key mechanisms contributing to the improvement  of host defense against microbes in CGD patients undergoing IFN-y therapy (307,  400).

## B. EFFECTS  F O IL-10

The effects of IL-10 on the production of cytokines by human neutrophils (289) and monocytes (401) have been  reviewed, and herein I will briefly deal with this information (see also Table VII). IL-10 was initially reported to inhibit the extracellular  production of TNF-a,  IL-lp,  and IL-8 triggered by  LPS  and  Y-IgG (79). Subsequently, it  was  demonstrated  that  IL-10 suppresses also the production  of  IL-la by  LPS-stimulated neutrophils, and that all its inhibitory effects are significantly  greater than the inhibitions observed  with  either  IL-4  or  TGF-j3 (51).  Interestingly,  Northern  blot analyses revealed that IL-10 diminished the LPS-induced mRNA accumulation of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-a, IL-1, and IL-8) only at time points later than 4-5 hr,  but  not  at  onset  (1-2  hr) (51, 79). All  of  these observations have been repeatedly confirmed by  several groups (88,  108. 309, 346, 348, 402, 403) and further extended by the demonstration that IL-  10-mediated inhibition of neutrophil-derived  cytokines also occurs in neutrophils  isolated  from  HIV-infected  individuals and  stimulated  with MP-F2 from C. nlbicans (13, 102).

Evidence  that  MIP-la arid  MIP-lj3 release by  neutrophils  stimulated with  LPS  is  inhibited  by  IL-10  has  been  provided  by  Kunkel's  group (24). Consistent with our previous studies on IL-8 (79), the extracellular production of MIP-la and hlIP-16, as well as the LPS-induced accumulation  of  mRNA encoding these chemokines, was  significantly suppressed by  IL-10 only after 4-8  hr of culture, and not before (24). Subsequently,

we showed that IL-10 also influences GRO-a production induced by LPS with a pattern identical to those of  IL-8 and MIP-ldP ( 2 1 ) . In addition, we demonstrated that IL-10 slightly  inhibits the release of GRO-a triggered by Y-IgG but potentiates  the release of  GRO-a induced by TNF-a ( 2 1 ) , evidence that not all of the effects of  IL-10 toward granulocytes are inhibitory.

The studies of  how  IL-10 and  IFN-y  affect  cytokine and  chemobnc production have revealed the existence of a PMN-centered cytokirie network regulating the production  of  IL-8, MIP-la, MIP-1P, and probably also GHO-a, in  LPS-stimulated PMNs ( 4 ) . This consists of  two distinct phases ( 4 ) . The early phase accounts for a low level of chemokine release, directly induced by LPS. This initial wave of chemokine release is followed by a second delayed phase, in which endogenous TNF-a and IL-lP synergize with  LPS in  inducing dramatically elevated levels of  IL-8,  MIP-La, MIP-1P, and probably also of GKO-a. This sequential production of chernokines by LPS-activated PMNs, regulated by TNF-a and IL-ID, might be finalized  to  amplify  the  recruitment  and  activation  of  neutrophils  and other leukocytes (luring an inflammatory response to LPS. Supporting the potential existence of  this network, the i n vitro profile of  TNF-a, IL-1P, and IL-8 secretion in response to C. rieofonnans was  found analogous to that observed with LPS (107). In contrast, an autocrine loop involving only IL-1P was shown to maintain the secretion of IL-8 by PMNs isolated from the  sputum  of  subjects with chronic bronchial sepsis (353). In the latter conditions, neutrophil-derived IL-8 was inhibited by IL-10 at levels significantly  lower  than  in  peripheral  blood  neutrophils  stimulated  with  LPS (353). It must, however,  be specified  that sputum neutrophils were presurnably  in an"activated"  state,  because  they  constitutively  secreted  large amounts of  IL-8, IL-1P, and TNF-a that were only slightly increased in the presence of  LPS (353).

IL-10 has been proved to be a potent inhibitor ofthe extracellular release of  IP-10 and  MIG  induced by  IFN-y plus  either  LPS  or TNF-a (146, 147), and of the extracellular  production of the p40 chain of heterodimeric IL-12 in human  PMNs treated with  LPS ( 1 2 ) . As a consequence of  the latter suppressive action, no biologically active IL-12 could be  measured in supernatants of neutrophils stimulated by  LPS plus IFN-y in the presence of  IL-10 ( 1 2 ) . Once again, these  inhibitory effects mediated  by  IL10 were paralleled by alterations at the level of cytokine mKNA accnmulation. In view of the fundamental role of IL-12, IP-10, and MIG to initiate and perpetuate  a Thl response (134-137, 283), 1L-10-mediated suppression of neiitropliil-derived IL-12, IP-10, and MIC, could represent a mcchanism, acting at the level of innate immunity, whereby IL-10 prevents TI11 cell generation and attraction during infections (404).

In contrast to the inhibitory effect on the production of proinflammatory cytokines  and  chemokines,  IL-10  markedly potentiates  the  mRNA  and extracellular yields of  IL-1RA (by two- to threefold  after  18 hr) in  LPSstimulated neutrophils, but not in Y-IgG-treated cells (258).  Additionally, IL-10 has been shown to up-regulate the constitutive neutrophil secretion of  IL-1RA (346). This  being  said, Jenkins et al. (405) reported  that  in neutrophils treated with LPS over a period of 22-24  hr, IL-10 significantly reduced  the overall IL-1P production,  but did not  influence that  of  ILIRA. However, they did not discriminate between the net effects of  IL10 on cell-associated versus secreted IL-10 or IL-1RA. In addition, they showed that  although IL-10 moderately decreased the  LPS-induced  IL1/3 mRNA at times later than 4 hr, in agreement with our previous results (79), IL-10  did  not  affect LPS-induced  IL-1RA mRNA levels, in  sharp contrast  to  our  findings  (258). We  do  not  have  an  explanation for  this discrepancy, although a possible hypothesis might be partially related  to the different concentrations of LPS used in the two studies. Nevertheless, the  net  result  of  the  effect  of  IL-10  on  neutrophils  was  to  increase  the ratio  of  IL-IRA  to  IL-1P (405), consistent  with  our  previous  data (79, 258). In  another  study, in  which  the yields  of  IL-1RA detected  in  cellfree supernatants of agonist-stimulated neutrophils were much higher than the  values  found  by  other  investigators (14, 258, 405), only  IL-4  was reported to amplify  the extracellular production of IL-1RA elicited by LPS (used at 100 ng/ml) (263). Conversely, IL-10 as well as IL-4 displayed an extremely high potency in up-regulating the production of IL-1RA induced by TNF-a (263), suggesting  that the effects of IL-10 on IL-1RA production triggered by LPS or TNF-a act through different pathways.

By  regulating  PMN-derived  cytokine production,  IL-10 may  have  an important  regulatory  role  in  limiting the  duration  and  extent  of  acute inflammatory responses, for instance in lethal endotoxemia. In this regard, Marie et al. (108)  have recently shown that, unlike monocytes (406), neutrophils exposed to LPS for 24 hr before a secondary stimulation with  LPS were not 'tolerant,' but instead displayed an enhanced IL-8 production. But if IL-10 and LPS were added simultaneously to PMN cultures during the  pretreatment  period, the  'priming' effects of  LPS were completely obliterated (108). These results suggest that  the  IL-10 produced  during sepsis (407) may render neutrophils unresponsive to a further stimulation with  LPS. On the other hand, the  fact that  the release  of  cytokines can be modulated not only by IFN-7, but also by IL-10, IL-4, and IL-13 (see below), argues for the possibility  that both Thl and Th2 lymphocytes  might play a role in  influencing the production  of cytokines by PMNs. Studies addressing the in uiun effects of  IL-10 on  neutrophil-derived  cytokmes are urgently required.

## 01; IL-4 AND IL-13

11,-4 and IL-13 represent additional inolecules able to inodulate inoderately the rcleasc of some cytokines by rieutrophils. For instance, treatment of  P M N s  with  1L-4 results in  a substantial reduction  in  the  IL-8 stcdystate  niHNA  Ic-vc.ls and protluction  stiinulated  by  LPS ( 5 1 , 88, 10Fj). In contrast, IL-4 is a poor inhibitor of  PMN-derived  IL-8 in  response to YIgG ( 5 ) and, similarly  to IL-13, does not inhibit the release of IL-8 triggered by  high  doses  of  TNF-a (20 nghl), whether  or  not  TNF-a  is  iised in coin1)ination with  LPS (88).  In its inhibitory action on  LPS-induced IL-H releasc, IL-4 is  i n o r e potent than equivalent concenterations of TGF-6 or IL-1:3,  but less potent than IL-10 ( 5 1 , 88).  Interestingly, though the inhibitoiy  effects of  IL-4 ( a s well as of  IL-13) greatly vary  depending on  the donor, the effects of IL-10 do not (88). Despite tliis donor variability, 11,-4 potentiates tlie negative effect of IL,-1O on IL-8 and other proinflammatoi~ cytokine release  by  neutrophils  (our unpublished  observations). In  fact, other than IL-8, IL,-4  has  also been  shown to  markedly decrease (by up to ,50941) the synthesis of IL-lP induced by LPS over a 22-hr period (235). This occurred without  affecting the LPS-stimulated IL-10 mHNA levels (235, and our unpublished experiinents),  suggesting that IL-4 acts at posttranscriptional levels. Furtherinore, IL-4 induces a substantial production of  IL-  1  A  from  neutrophils, which  is  more than  additively increased  by R coincu1)ation with LPS (235, 263). As  mentioned,  IL-4 or IL-10, but  not IL-1:3 o r TCF-P,  also  amplifies  the  production  of  IL-  1  RA  induced  by TNF-a (263). Although there are no reports on the effects of  IL,-4 or 1L13 011 the production  of  TNF-a by  I'MNs, our preliminary data suggest that TNF-a mHNA expression and release induced by LPS are inhi1)itcd by  IL-4, but less efficiently than by IL-10 ( 5 ) . It remains to be investigated whether JL-4, a s IL-10, down-regulates tlie releasc of IL-8 inchiced by I P S becaiise of its inhibition on endogenous TNF-a and IL-16 prodiiction ( 4 ) .

Under  some  circumstances  GM-CSF may act as ii priming  agent  for iieutropliil-tleriv~~cl tokines. y For instance, CM-CSF may piinie  neutrophils  for an enhanced TNF-a and IL-8 production induced by  LI'S ( 5 0 ) .

IL-8, and MIP-la, whereas it only marginally affected IL-1RA synthesis. These actions occurred without  inodifications of  the IL-la, IL-lp, IL-8, and MIP-la mRNA steady-state levels (120,  267), supporting the notion that GM-CSF acts at a translational level. Though the majority of  IL-la, IL-lP, and IL-8 newly synthesized in response to either GM-CSF or EBV remained inside the cell, the combination of  the two agonists resulted in significantly more of  the  IL-8 being  secreted (267), whereas  IL-la and IL-1 remained cell associated (120). This was in contrast to what observed with MIP-la, the majority of which was secreted irrespective of the treatment (120).

Several other experimental conditions have been  described  as further modulating the production of cytokines by activated neutrophils. For example, a synergistic release of  IL-8 by neutrophils has been shown to occur in  response to IL-15 plus inactivated C. albicans (86), to LPS plus TNFa (50,  108) or fMLP (68), and to some bacteria or mycobacterial  derivatives plus TNF-a (114,  120). On a related note, the release of IL-6 induced b y cross-linking of  FcyRI or FcyRII was potentiated  by  G-CSF (275). The effects of inflammatory  microcrystals on neutrophil-derived cytokines have already been extensively summarized (5).

## VI. Molecular Regulation of Cytokine Production in Neutrophils

An  increasing body  of  knowledge  is  now  available  on  the  molecular mechanisms that regulate cytokine gene expression in neutrophils. Studies addressing cytokine release at the molecular level have revealed that cytokine production  is  usually preceded by an  increased accumulation of the related  mRNA transcripts. A s   in inonocybc cells (which have been more extensively studied in this regard), the control of cytokine gene expression in  neutrophils  can  take  place  at  the  transcriptional,  posttranscriptional, translational,  and posttranslational levels.  This evidence derives from either direct experimental demonstrations or indirect indications  obtained through the use of selective metabolic drugs ( 5 ) . The latter include actinornycin  D (ACT D),  which is a blocker of RNA synthesis that can indicate that the induction of a given gene is regulated at the transcriptional level, or cycloheximide,  puromycin, and emetine, which are inhibitors of protein synthesis. Results obtained with ACT D have indirectly suggested that the induction of  IL-lp, IL-lRA, IL-8, and MIP-la transcripts in neutrophils stimulated with various agonists involves transcriptional events. As will be discussed below, this is already known to be the case for IL-lp, IL-8, and MIP-la. CHX has been shown to inhibit, superinduce, or have no effect on the induction of a given cytokine mRNA, depending on the particular mRNA under  investigation and  the  stimulatory conditions. In  any case.

the  use  of  CHX has  made it clear that  the influence of de novo protein synthesis on  the  steady-state level  of  a  given  cytokine mRNA can  vary considerably depending on the triggering stimulus.

## A.  TRANSCRIPTIONAL  LATION REGU

The transcriptional activity of a given gene can be directly determined by the  nuclear  run-on  assay technique.  However, very few investigators have performed such assays in PMNs probably due to the extreme tlifficulties encountered in attempting to detect the very low transcriptional activity of  these  cells (51, 408). This  being  said, the  use  of  this  approach  has nevertheless revealed that neutrophils actively transcribe the IL-1P gene in response to IL-1, TNF-a, IL-1 plus TNF-a (409), LPS (410), and GMCSF (232). Similarly, the IL-8 and MIP-la genes have been shown to be transcriptionally induced in  response to LPS in neutrophils (410, 411).

Very little is  known concerning the regulation of  gene transcription  in neutrophils, but it is noteworthy that many cytokine genes depend on the activation of  transcription  factors, such as  NF-KB (412). For this reason, we have started to investigate the expression and distribution  of  NF-KB/ Re1 proteins and of their cytoplasmic inhibitor, IKB-a,  n human peripheral i blood neutrophils, as well as their respective fate on cell activation (413). Among a wide range of neutrophil agonists,  TNF-a, LPS, fMLP, and PMA were  found  to  induce  efficiently both  the  nuclear  accumulation  of  NF&amp;/Re1  proteins  and  the  concomitant  degradation  of  cytoplasmic IKBa, whereas  IL-1P,  LTB4, and  PAF proved  to  be  weaker  stimuli at  the concentrations  tested (413). Moreover, the  onset  of  both  processes was paralleled by the  activation of  nuclear  NF-KB DNA-binding activity. In contrast,  GM-CSF, G-CSF, IFN-a, IFN-7, IL-8, and IL-10 exerted  no detectable effect on  any of  these  responses  (up to  120 min) (413). The stimuli that promote the nuclear accumulation of Re1 family proteins and the concomitant activation of  NF-KB  can be subdivided into two general categories: those whose action  is  rapid, and the slower acting ones. The effect of the former (TNF-a and LPS, and on a much smaller scale, ILlp)  was evident by 10  min and reached a maximum by 30 min. In contrast, the latter agonists (fMLP and PMA, and to a lesser extent, PAF and LTBJ required at least 30 inin to exert a similar action, a maximal effect usually being observed between 45 and 60 min. We finally demonstrated that in neutrophils, the degradation of 1 ~ B - a   otein and the concomitant nuclear pr activation of NF-KB  were accompanied by a marked accumulation of IKBa mHNA transcripts, resulting in the reexpression of the protein, through de novo synthesis (413). More recently, we have also reported that NF-KB is rapidly and transiently induced in neutrophils undergoing phagocytosis of Y-IgG particles (414) or stimulated by IL-15, but not by  IL-2 (90). Other

groups have  confirmed our results  (76, 239, 415), except in  the  case of GM-CSF, which, in  contrast to our findings (413), was  found to induce NF-KB activity (239). Therefore,  further studies  are  required  to  clarify whether GM-CSF activates NF-KB in PMNs.

## B. REGULATION  T A THE LEVEL,  MRNA  STABILITY OF

As  opposed to transcriptional regulation, there are many demonstrations that cytokine gene expression of neutrophils can be regulated at the level of mRNA stability. For instance, this is one of the mechanisms explaining the up-regulation of  IL-10 mRNA expression in neutrophils treated with IL-1, TNF-a, IL-1 plus TNF-a (409),  or GM-CSF (232).  mRNA stabilization  analyses have also demonstrated that  MIP-la mRNA isolated from PMNs stimulated in the presence of GM-CSF plus LPS had a prolonged half-life, relative to LPS alone (23).  Another cytokine  mRNA, that encoding IL-lRA, was found to be mainly regulated at the posttranscriptional level in  neutrophils.  The  augmented  expression of  IL-1KA  mRNA  in  PMNs treated  with  IL-13  (49) and  TGF-P1  (262) was  shown  to  depend  on  a marked increase in IL-1RA transcript  stability. The possible contribution of  transcriptional  induction  of  the  IL-1RA gene could not, however, be excluded, in  that ACT D partially blocked the enhancing effect that  IL13 (49) and  TGF-P1  (262) had  on  IL-1R4  mRNA  steady-state  levels. Finally, the half-life of IL-1RA mHNA was prolonged in PMNs stimulated in the presence of IL-10 and LPS, as compared with cells stimulated with LPS alone (258).

The mechanisms underlying some of  the  modulatory effects of  IL-10 and IFN-7 on cytokine mRNA accumulation in  LPS-treated neutrophils have been  extensively analyzed. The stimulatory effect of  LPS on  IL-10 gene transcription was  found to be uninfluenced by  either IFN-7 or IL10 (410). Under identical experimental conditions, both  IL-10 (258) and IFN-7  (our  unpublished observations)  also failed to have a significant effect on  the  stability of  IL-lP  mRNA  isolated  from  LPS-treated  PMNs.  In contrast, the inhibitory effect of IL-10 on LPS-induced IL-8 mRNA accumulation was  shown  to  correlate with  an  enhancement  of  IL-8  mRNA degradation (24,118),  and our experiments indicated that IL-10 and IFNy also inhibit the rate of LPS-stimulated IL-8 gene transcription in PMNs (410). It can therefore be envisaged that IL-10 inhibits LPS-induced  IL8 mHNA accumulation both through inhibition of IL-8 gene transcription and  through  enhanced  degradation  of  IL-8  mRNA.  MIP-la represents another  gene  whose  early  down-modulation  by  IFN-7  in  LPS-treated PMNs (24, 179) is  regulated  at  the  level of  transcription  (411). A s   also observed  for  IL-8  (79, 179) and  MIP-1P  (179), IFN-7 inhibits  mRNA expression and production of MIP-la from LPS-stimulated PMNs at early

time points, but  augments  MIP-la expression later on (179). IFN-y did not affect MIP-la mHNA stability in PMNs treated with LPS for 2-4  hr ( I   79,  41 1 ). However, after stimulation of  neutrophils with  LPS for 24 hr, tlie  stability of  MIP-la inHNA was  shown to be significantly prolonged IIV IFN-y (179). In contrast to IFN-y, IL-10 inhibited LPS-induced MIPl h inRNA acciimulation through enhanced mHNA degradation (24). \Ve found  that  IL-10  does  not  inhibit  the  rate  of  LPS-stimulated  MIP-la gene  transcription  in  PMNs  (our unpublished  observations), therefore confirming  that IL-10 primarily  acts at the level of MIP-la inHNA stability. Although no studies on MIP-1P gene transcription have heen reported to date,  MIP-1P inHNA expression was  influenced by  IL-10 and  IFN-y in the same manner as MIP-la, that is, at the posttranscriptional  level (24, 179). Stability of  MIP-1P mRNA in  LPS-treated neutrophils was  significantly prolonged by IFN-y at 24 hr (1  79),  but not at the 4-hr time point, arid was  markedly diminished by IL-10 at 4 and 8 hr ( 2 4 ) .

Another  series  of  observations  indicate  that  mechanisms  other  than gene transcription or inHNA stabilization are involved in the regulation of cytokine production  in  neutrophils. A  clear  demonstration  of  a  form  of translational  control in PMNs has been shown for IL-1 (1 1 ) . It was observed that  although LPS induced the expression of  IL-la and IL-1P iiiHNA  in PMNs, these cells were niiich less efficient in translating these transcripts when conipared with  PBMCs ( 1 1 ) . In contrast, both  PMN- and PBMCderived IL-1 niHNAs were translated with equal efficiency in an in vitro protein  synthesis system (11). IL-4  markedly decreased  the  total  IL-IP protein synthesis  in LPS-induced  PMNs,  without  reducing  the  LPSstimulated  IL-lP inRNA levels, suggesting that  the effects of  IL-4 were mediated at the translational level (235).

Control  at  the translational level  has  also been  suggested for  IL-1RA and MlP-la rnKNA, under specific experimental conditions. Pretreatmrwt of neutrophils with TNF-a before stimulation with calcium pyropliosphate dihydrate microcrystals up-regulates the levels of IL-1KA niHNA as coinpared with induction by TNF-a alone, whereas cell-associated  and secreted protein  levels of  II,-lHA were inhibited in  the presence of  CPPD (251). Under tlie same conditions, CPPD crystals synergistically increased both I L l P inHNA and protein levels in TNF-a-treated neutrophils. These data suggest that  inhibition of  IL-1HA synthesis by  CCPD  in TNF-a-treated ncutrophils occurs at the translational level (251). In the caw of MIP-la, both CPPD and inonosodium urate inonohydrute inhibited the iminunodetectable  MIP-la inc1iicc.d by  TNF-a, withoiit  affecting MIP-la stcadystate inHNA levels ( 2 5 ) . Because the crystals neither enhaiiced the degw

dation  of  MIP-la protein  nor  interfered  with  the  immunodetection  of MIP-la by  ELISA, the data suggest that  the inhibitory effect of  microcrystals on  MIP-la protein production is primarily translational ( 2 5 ) .

Both zymosan and S. cerevisine have been shown to inhibit the production  of  MIP-la  induced  By  TNF-a (114). As  hypothesized  for  CPPD and MSU, a possible inhibitory mechanism at of phagocytic agonists was postulated to occur at the level of the MIP-la gene translation. This was because  zymosan  and S.  ccrevisine, while  inducing the  accumulation of MIP-la mRNA, neither inhibited  MIP-la secretion nor caused MIP-la extracellular degradation ( I 14). Similarly, when  neutrophils  were  stimulated  by M. tuberculosis or  PPD  in  the  presence  of  TNF-a, expression of  MIP-la  mRNA was  significantly higher  than  that  stimulated  by M. tuberculosis or PPD alone, but production of antigenic MIP-la was diminished,  not  increased  (80). In  this  case,  a  retained  enhanced  neutrophil apoptosis rate, induced by  mycobacterium derivatives plus TNF-a, was responsible for the  reduced production of  MIP-la (80).

Further  evidence  that  cytokine  or  chemokine  mRNA  transcripts  may be  under  translational control has  been  derived from studies addressing the effects of GM-CSF in EBV-treated neutrophils. Pretreatment of neutrophils with GM-CSF prior to EBV stimulation, synergistically enhanced the production of IL-la and IL-lP, but only slightly affected the synthesis of  IL-1RA (267). The fact that  cytokine synthesis was  increased by  GMCSF in the absence of changes in  mRNA levels suggests a more effective translation of IL-1 and IL-1RA mKNA (267). Additional studies from the same  group  showed  that  GM-CSF  increased  the  production  of  EBVinduced neutrophil  IL-8 and MIP-la by approximately two- to threefold (120). Pretreatment with GM-CSF failed to increase levels of the steadystate mRNA encoding IL-1 and IL-lRA, supporting the idea that GM-CSF predominantly primes EBV-treated neutrophils at a posttranscriptional or a translational level (220).

Finally,  it was reported that the induction by GM-CSF of TNF-a mRNA accumulation in PMNs is not accompanied by TNF-a Synthesis or release (162). Although  the  reasons  for  this  lack  of  TNF-a  synthesis were  not further investigated,  it nevertheless may be speculated that TNF-a production might be subjected to translational regulation. If so, it is also conceivable that by increasing the steady-state level of TNF-a InRNA, GM-CSF may act as  a 'priming' agent for a subsequent triggering stimulus, as  in fact has been  demonstrated to occur on LPS stimulation (50).  In another study,  nitric  oxide-generating  compounds  increased  neutrophilic  LPSinduced TNF-a production, yet without increasing TNF-a mRNA levels (398). It must be stressed, however, that  Northern blots were performed at  a  single time  point  (1  hr). If  Northern  blots  performed  at  later  time

points could confirm the lack of effect of nitric oxide-generating  compounds on  TNF-a  rnRNA  steady-state  levels,  then  the  enhancement  of  TNFa production  by  these  compounds would likely reflect  a  modulation  of translation or secretion.

## D. POS7THANSI~ATIONAI.  HE(~IJ1,ATION

Several reports  describe  regulatory inechaiiisins in  neutrophils  at  the level of cytokine  secretion. A more effieint  secretion of IL-1KA as compared to that obtained with the single agonists was observed in PMNs stimulated with  IL-4 plus LPS (235), or with IL-10 plus TNF-a (263). Similarly, the enhancement  of  IL-1RA  release  by  IFN-y (248) or  GM-CSF (267) in neutrophils stimulated with LPS or EBV, respectively,  appeared essentially to take place at the level of secretion.

IL-8  is  another  cytokine  for  which  there  is  numerous  experimental evidence that  production  may  be  regulated  at  the  level of  secretion.  In one of our studies we separately quantified the IL-8 immunoreactivity that remained  cell associated, and  that was  released by  the cells, in  order to better  examine  whether  the  effects  of  IFN-y  on  agonist-induced  1L-8 production might reflect changes in IL-8 synthesis  or secretion (124). This study brought  forward a number of interesting observations (124). First, the total production of  IL-8 in  LPS- and Y-IgG-treated PMNs (as well as in  resting cells) continuously increased, up to 18 hr. Second, the amounts of  IL-8  released  by  resting  PMNs,  as  well  as  by  LPS-, TNF-a-, and  YIgG-activated cells, increased  throughout  the  incubation period, but  the ainounts of secreted IL-8 were inferior to those that were cell-associated, except for Y-IgG. Third, although the accuinulation of  IL-8 mRNA paralleled the  increase  in  total  IL-8 protein  levels in  both  LPS- and  Y-IgGactivated PMNs, the latter secreted IL-8 more efficiently than  did LPSstimulated cells. Fourth, in PMNs pretreated with IFN-y and then stiinulated for up to 6 hr, the total synthesis of IL-8  was significantly lower than when  the  cells  were  exposed  to  the  stimuli  in  the  absence  of  IFN-y. However, total  IL-8 production  after  18 hr  of  incubation  with  various stimuli was  not  significantly affected by the presence or absence of  IFNy, except  for  Y-IgC-treated  cells.  All  these  effects  were  paralleled  by changes at  the  inRNA level. Moreover, the percentage of  IL-8 secreted after stimulation with  LPS and TNF-a for up to 18 hr, or with Y-IgG for 2  hr, was  significantly higher in PMNs that were pretreated  with  IFN-y in  comparison  with  untreated  cells.  Thus,  even  though  IFN-y-treated PMNs synthesized less  IL-8 than  untreated  PMNs, they  secreted  IL-8 more efficiently after stimulation with  LPS or TNF-a, at all time points examined.  Altogether, these studies indicated that the up-regulatory effects of  IFN-y on LPS- and TNF-a-induced secretion of  IL-8, observed after 18 hr, were  largely explained by  the  potentiating  effect of  IFN-y at  the

level  of  IL-8  secretion.  That  IL-8  accumulation  is  under  translational control was also revealed by the fact that CHX, but not ACT D, inhibited the accumulation of cell-associated IL-8 after culture at 37°C for 2 hr (63).

In  vitro assays of  LPS-stimulated  neutrophils  from  healthy  or  septic patients  demonstrate equivalent levels of  cell-associated IL-8 (108). Because PMNs from septic  patients release smaller  amounts of IL-8 compared to  those  of  control  subjects,  it  is  evident  that  in  septic neutrophils  the proportion of IL-8 secreted is lower (108). Finally, the percentage of IL8  secreted by PMNs in response to LPS was shown to increase in correlation with the doses of LPS used (380), and the enhancement of IL-8 production by  GM-CSF, in  EBV-treated neutrophils, appeared  to take place  at the level of translation and secretion (120).

Experiments performed in my laboratory revealed that the extracellular production of GRO-a by PMNs does not always correlate with equivalent changes  at  the  level  GRO-a  mRNA  expression. That  did  occur  in  YIgG-stimulated  PMNs,  and  the  extracellular production  of  GRO-a was approximately two- to threefold  more effective than with LPS or TNF-a stimulation (21). However, the increase of GRO-a transcripts was markedly less  pronounced (21). These findings indicated  that  Y-IgG phagocytosis regulates GRO-a production at the level of secretion, and this is in keeping our observations on Y-IgG-stimulated secretion  of  IL-8, as  summarized above (124). In contrast, culture of PMNs with fMLP strongly promoted GRO-a mRNA accumulation but contained amounts of GRO-a that were not  significantly higher  than  those  from  untreated  cells (21). A  possible explanation is that GRO-a is released but rapidly degraded by the proteolytic enzymes that are simultaneously secreted in response to fMLP. Conversely, it cannot be excluded that in spite of its ability to strongly induce GRO-a mRNA, fMLP fails to provide the intracellular signals necessary to either translate or secrete GRO-a. If so, this would suggest that GROa production is controlled at the translational or posttranslational level, as previously observed for GRO-a during malignant transformation of normal melanocytes (416). What is  more,  IL-10 did  not  affect the  LPS-elicited accumulation of GRO-a mRNA ( 2 1 ) , suggesting that its inhibitory effect on  LPS-induced  GRO-a production  likely occurs at the  translational or posttranslational level.

A last consideration is that in most of the studies quantifying the proportion  of  cell-associated cytokines, the percentages  of the cytokines linked to their receptors were not measured. This should be considered, however, because it may profoundly influence the results and the conclusions.

## VII.  Cytokine Production by Neutrophilr in  vivo

Studies evaluating the possibility that PMNs are a significant source of cytokines in vivo are ongoing. In specific experimental animal models the

production of  cytokines by neutrophils appears to be fiiridamental for the evolution and/or resolution of the induced pathological proce summarizes the  cytokines that  have  been  described  to  be  prodiiced  by neutrophils in oivo.

## A. EFFIX:'I.S o~ LPS ADMINISTHATION NEU'I.HOPIIIL-DEHIVEL) ON CYTOKINES in Vivo

A classic way to study neutrophil cytokine expression i n uivo is  an LPSinduced acute  inflamiriation in  animals. A n   exainple is  the  intratraclieal injection (IT)  of endotoxin, which in rats causes a dramatic influx of PMNs into the bronchoalvolar space. When  kinetics of  cytokine mRNA expression in tlie lung were investigated by Northern analysis, it was  found that IL-la inHNA peaked at 2 to 6 hr, whereas IL-1PIIL-lRA inRNA peaked at  6 hr, concurrent with  the  maximum  influx of  neutrophils  (15).  It was hypothesized that the production of  IL-1 by PMNs may play a role in tlie activation of lyniphocytes  during the transition between acute neutrophilic and chronic mononuclear inflammation, whereas the synthesis of  IL- 1  HA might  function a s a  negative  feedback  mechanism  tliat  down-regulates neutrophil influx into inflammatory sites. Fractionation of alveolar macrophage (AM)  -enriched and PMN-enriched subpopulations from bronclioalveolar lavage cells revealed that neutrophils were the predominant  source for both  IL-lculp and IL-1RA mKNA (15). Using a similar model, Xlng ~t nl. (417) provided i n uiuo evidence that PMNs can represent a significant source of TNF-a at sites of  acute inflammation in rats. By  Northt~n lot b analysis, they  fouiid  that  PMNs  displayed  several  times  more  TNF-a mRNA than did AMs  at 6 and  12 hr after  IT instillation of  LPS. By in situ hybridization, most of the cells positive for TNF-a mRNA were PMNs localized within  tlie  inflamed tissue near  bronchioles  or vessels.  By [ € I , TNF-a protein  was  localized  mainly  to  AMs  at  early  times  after  LPS challenge (1-3 hr),  whereas thereafter (6-12 hr)  PMNs were the predominant source of TNF-a protein (41  7). The same group siibsequently demonstrated  that  in  lung  PMNs  and  AMs,  LPS  triggers  a  distinct  cytokine response,  by  selectively increasing inHNA transcripts  encoding  TNF-a, IL-1P, IL-6, and  MIP-2, but  not  KANTES or TCF-01 (418). At ii time (1 hr) when only a minimal PMN infiltration was present, AMs appeared to be the predominant source of  all cytokines examined, whereas at later times (6  and 12 hr),  when PMN infiltration became maximal, PMNs were the prominent source of those cytokines.  A low, basal, noniriducible signal for TGF-P1 (but not for RANTES) rnHNA was detected in both AMs and PMNs (418). Interestingly, ISH of  the  lung tissue  revealed  that among the cells that stained for MIP-2 mHNA in response to LPS were, particularly, the PMNs located in the vicinity of bronchioles and vasculature, but

not within  the vasculature (418). Under  similar experimental  conditions (IT  instillation  of LPS),  recruited PMNs could rapidly (30 min) and persistently (up  to 16 hr) be induced to express MIP-2 and KC/GRO-dMGSA (419). Although Northern  analyses were performed on pooled  BAL cell mRNA, these BAL cell populations changed from predominantly macrophages (&gt;95%) to mostly PMNs (60%  within 2 hr, 91% after 16 hr) after LPS instillation (419). Furthermore, expression of MIP-2 and KC  mRNA was  also observed within exudative neutrophils obtained after intraperitoneal injection of thioglycollate (419). Collectively, these observations support  the  notion  that  in  these  lung  models of  LPS-elicited inflammation, infiltrating PMNs  represent  a  significant source  of  proinflammatory cytokines.

Lukaszewicz and  colleagues (420) studied CINC mRNA induction  in lungs of normal, neutropenic, and adrenalectomized rats after intraperitoneal injection of E. coli LPS. After a single dose of LPS, rapid induction of  CINC mRNA coincided with  neutrophil infiltration into lungs, a  response that lasted approximately 12 to 24 hr. However, it was not formally proved to be a  causal  relationship  between CINC expression  and neutrophil lung infiltration (420). Interestingly, CINC mRNA induction in lungs was heightened 30% in  adrenalectomized animals, consistent with the role of glucocorticosteroids as potent  inhibitors of chemokine production (421 ), and 400% in neutropenic ones (420). The latter data suggest that neutrophils may act to inhibit expression of CINC, limiting in this way their own influx into tissue via a negative feedback mechanism.

Production of TNF-a, IL-lp, IL-8, and IL-1RA was also analyzed in a model of  local Shwartzman reaction  (LSR) studied in rabbit  lung (422). In this model, myeloperoxidase activity (representing  neutrophil accumulation) peaked at 1-2  hr and was sustained for 48 hr after intravenous (IV) challenge w ih t LPS.  Kinetics of  cytokine production revealed that TNF-a was the first to appear, peaking at 0.5  hr, whereas IL-1p and IL-8 increased later  and  peaked  at  2  hr (422). IL-1RA was  present  even  before  the challenge, and its increased production showed a dual peak: at 0.5-2  and at 48 hr. The authors speculated that this endogenous IL-1RA might serve to suppress part of IL-1 activity and function through a negative feedback mechanism to prevent  an  excessive inflammatory response.  IH  showed that  the  cellular sources of  these  cytokines were  infiltrating neutrophils and AMs (422), and it was  inferred that production  of  cytokines was not a direct mediator for the initiation of LSR, but likely the consequence of events following leukocyte infiltration.

Circulating PMNs can also constitute a prominent source of  cytokines in LPS-mediated inflammations.  Williams et al. (423) showed that following IV infusion  of  LPS  for  2  hr  in  rats,  PMNs  rather  than  PBMCs  in  the

pulmonary vasculature  were  the  major  source  of  IL-10  transcripts.  In contrast,  no  induction  of  IL-10  expression was  observed  in  airway  or circulating  leukocytes.  Under these experimental conditions, LPS increased pulmonary vascular  sequestration  of  leukocytes, recruiting  most  prominently an activated pool of neutrophils that were more atlherent, that were primed for increased reactive oxygen intermediate (KO1 ) production, and that expressed increased IL-10 messages. Thus, this early study suggested a more prominent role than previously appreciated for sequestered neutrophils in  sepsis-induced lung inflammation. Another study has shown that neutrophils  that  traffic to  the  lungs  are  a  major  source  of  IL-lp in  the lungs after hemorrhage and endotoxemia (424). In particular,  IL-1p was detected  by IFI in  enriched  pulmonary  neutrophil  populations  isolated 1 hr  after hemorrhage  or endotoxernia, but not in  lymphocytes ( 4 2 4 ) . I n neutropenic  inice  IL-lp expression  was  lower  than  in  control  animals, providing a possible explanation of previous observations that neutropenia decreases alveolar leak and acute lung injury in endotoxin-treated uninials (425). In  addition,  neutrophils  seen  in  the  pulinonary  vasculature were noted  to  express  IL-lP (424), suggesting that  endotoxin or  hemorrhage induces IL-10 production by neutrophils before these cells enter the Iiing parenchyma. These data indicate that IL-lp-producing neutrophils traffic to the lungs rapidly in response to hemorrhage or endotoxeinia and support the concept that proinflammatory cytokine production by lung neutrophils may contrihte to the developrnent of lung injury after lilood  loss and sepsis. In a different study, Cirelli et (11. (426) confirmed that an  iiccuinulation of intravasculw mononuclear phagocytes  and neutrophils  in the puliiioiiary circulation takes place during a continuous infusion of endotoxin in sheep. These authors detected an increased cytoplasmic TNF-a immunoreuctivity in both mononuclear phagocytes and neutrophils sequestered in puliiionary arterioles, capillaries,  and venules (426). Coincidentally,  plasnia Ic~els of  TNF-a  sigiiificantly increased,  suggesting that  both  neutrophils  and mononuclear pliagocytes contribiited  to the rise  in  the circulating levels of TNF-a, and the developrnerit of  acute lung injury (426).

Other studies deinonstrated that ethanol intoxication inhibits iNOS biit not TNF-a mHNA expression in  AMs  or neutrophils recruited to the rat lung in  response to  LPS (427), and that the  release of  constitutive TNF-a by inflammatory neutrophils isolated from pleural exudate of  rats treated with  prolactin  is  markedly  enhanced (428). Furthermore,  carragecnan (CAH) pretreatment  was  shown  to  prime  inice  for an erihanced  LPSinduced TNF-a production in sera and increased their mortality rate (429). It  was then  ohseivetl  that CAR treatment  enhances  the  LPS-indiiced TNF-a activity in the supernatants of neutrophils, but not of mononiiclear cells (429).  Because  both serum TNF-a and mortality risk were significantly

lower in neutropenic mice, the data suggest that neutrophils are the major TNF-a-producing cells, thus being responsible for mortality (429).

Nil1 et al. (430) compared the temporal sequence of endotoxin-induced TNF-a,  IL-la, and  IL-10  gene  expression  and  cellular  localization  of cytokine proteins  in pulmonary tissue of  two  strains of  mice that have  a genetically based  differential  sensitivity to  endotoxin.  Cytokine  mRNA were  studied  by  RT-PCR and  ISH  in  lung  tissue  obtained  from  the endotoxin-sensitive C3H/HeN  and endotoxin-resistant C3H/HeJ  mice at different times after  IP injection of  LPS (430). Although  levels of  TNF-a niRNA and protein in the two mouse strains were similar at 1-2  hr, IL-la gene and protein expression in pulmonary tissue isolated from endotoxinresistant mice was lower at any time point examined (430). IL-10 mRNA and protein  levels were  up-regulated  and  continued  to  increase  over  a 12-hr  time period in C3H/HeN mice,  whereas they were basically undetectable in CH3/HeJ endotoxin-resistant mice. In both types of mouse strains, TNF-a, IL-la, and IL-10 immunoreactive proteins were localized primarily to the infiltrating  neutrophils, as well as to AMs and type I1  pneumocytes (430). However, quantitation of neutrophil infiltration into pulmonary tissue demonstrated that there was a significant decrease in the inflammatory infiltrate in pulmonary tissue isolated from CH3/HeJ mice following LPS administration, which correlated with decreased levels of immunoreactive cytokine proteins within pulmonary cells (430). These results unequivocally implicate that infiltrating neutrophils  are important cellular mediators of pulmonary  tissue  damage  induced  by  endotoxin  in  the  CH3H/HeN endotoxin-sensitive mice.

Terebuth et al. (431) performed IH to localize cells expressing IL-6 in selected organs of normal and endotoxin-challenged mice. In normal mice, a constitutive cytoplasmic IL-6 immunoreactivity was  detected in  blood monocytes and their precursors, in bone marrow and splenic stromal macrophages,  and  in  granulocytes as  well (431). Though  significant serum levels of  IL-6 were  absent, cell-associated IL-6 bioactivity was  found  in circulating PMNs but not in  lymphocytes. However, after IP injection of LPS, there was a two- to threefold increase in PMN cell-associated IL-6 bioactivity from  1 to  3 hr,  followed by  an  ahnost  complete depletion  at 6 hr. Concomitantly,  serum levels of IL-6  peaked at 3  hr after LPS challenge and  dropped  significantly by 6 hr.  Interestingly,  constitutive,  increased intracellular  IL-6  in  circulating  PMNs  was  detected  in  the  absence  of IL-6 mRNA, which was instead present in granulocytic/inonocytic  progenitors in the bone marrow. In the latter cells, IL-6 transcripts increased with a  siniilar time  course  after  LPS  challenge (431). These data  suggest  a scenario  in which circulating  granulocytes  bear IL-6 as a stored component, likely  acquired  during  bone  marrow  maturation.  During  endotoxemia,

granulocytes release  IL-6 as  a result  of  appropriate signals received, for example, during margination or chemotaxis.

To better clarify the pathogenesis of arthritis, Yoshinaga's group used a model of rabbit arthritis induced by intraarticular injection of LPS. Initially, they observed that the IL-1P produced by  neutrophils  and macrophages in the synovial exudate was responsible for both leukocyte infiltration and loss of proteoglycans (432). Destruction  of cartilage was the consequence of  leukocyte-derived cartilage-degrading substances, such as elastase and superoxide anion (432). In  leukopenic rabbits, injection of  LPS induced neither  production  of  IL-1p  nor  loss  of  PG. They  also investigated the generation kinetics of IL-lRA, and its significance in  the pathogenesis of LPS arthritis. Production of IL-1RA (by  leukocytes) was delayed compared to IL-lp,  was sustained for 1  eek, and was in 180-  to 200-fold molar excess w of  IL-1p. LPS-induced leukocyte infiltration was inhibited by 70-7,5% by rabbit IL-1RA (432). Furthermore, the administration of anti-IL-1RA mAb with  LPS into rabbit knee joints increased the IL-1 activity fourfold and the  production  of  antigenic  IL-lP by  30-50%.  This  treatment  also enhanced  the  LPS-induced  leukocyte  infiltration  and  protein  leakage  by 20-40% (433), suggesting that endogenous  IL-1HA may  suppress a part of  IL-1 activity i n situ, but that its amount was too low for suppression of all  the  biologic effects of  IL-1p.  Subsequently, the  same group injected homologous IL-8 in rabbit knee joints and investigated the inflammatory response (434). In these experiments, IL-8 induced a massive accumulation of neutrophils (but no appreciable numbers of lymphocytes)  and provoked the  release  of  neutrophil  elastase, which  led to cartilage destruction.  In addition, injection of  IL-8 induced bioactive and immunoreactive  II,-lp and  IL-lRA, but  not  TNF-a in  the joint  cavity. As  determined  by  IH, IL-1P- and IL-1RA-positive cells were, again, infiltrating leukocytes (434). Production kinetics of iininunoreactive IL-1RA in  SF overlapped that of IL-lp, but the peak concentration  of  IL-1RA exceeded that of  IL-lp by it 40to  50-fold molar  ratio.  Strikingly, in  neutrophil-depleted  rabbits, IL-8  induced  no  cartilage  destruction  and  far  lesser  concentrations  of IL-lp and  IL-1RA as compared with  normal rabbits (434), proving that infiltrating neutrophils  were  the  main  producers  of  these  cytokines and that  they were  responsible for cartilage destruction. What  is  more, IL-8 induced little macrophageflymphocyte  accumulation in neutrophildepleted rabbits, suggesting that early neutrophil accumulation may affect the later accumulation of macrophages or lymphocytes, likely througli the production of specific chemoattractants. The authors thus concluded that IL-8 is a potent  neutrophil  activator in vivo and may  have a crucial role in the biology of  inflammation and the pathogenesis of inflammatory processes, including septic arthritis (434). In  more  recent  papers, the  same

group investigated the network and involvement  of inflammatory  cytokines in their rabbit model of  LPS-induced arthritis (435). The study was based on the assumption that production of TNF-a precedes that of  IL-1p and IL-1RA and  that  IL-8 is  detectable  after  IL-1.  Surprisingly, maximum levels of TNF-a and IL-8 were detected 2 hr after LPS injection, whereas IL-1p and  IL-1RA were  detected after 6 and 9 hr, respectively. By  IH, synovial cells were positive for TNF-a and IL-8, and infiltrating leukocytes were positive for IL-lp, IL- IRA, and IL-8. In neutrophil-depleted rabbits, the levels of TNF-a, and IL-8 were similar to those in normal rabbits. In contrast,  no  IL-1p was  detected in  neutrophil-depleted  rabbits  and  the levels of  IL-1RA were much lower (435). The effects of neutralizing antibodies against  TNF-a, IL-lP,  and IL-8 led to many important observations. First, TNF-a and IL-8  were produced by synovial  lining  cells,  were the first cytokines appearing at the site of  inflammation, and induced subsequent production of  IL-1p and IL-1RA by neutrophils.  Second, IL-1p induced further production of IL-lp, and, endogenous IL-1RA down-regulated the production  of  IL-1p but  not that of TNF-a or IL-8 (435). Interestingly, the  early phase  of  the  leukocyte influx was  not  blocked by inhibitors  of each cytokine,  indicating that this phase was dependent on other chemoattractants, such as C5a, PAF,  or LTB4 (435). Furthermore, late accumulation of  neutrophils  was  inhibited  only  by  40  to  60% by  anti-TNF-a  mAbs, recombinant IL-lRA, or anti-IL-8 IgG, suggesting  that factor(s)  other than IL-8  (probably  GRO-a,  MIP-2, or  ENA-78) were  involved in  the  late phase of leukocyte influx in LPS-induced arthritis (435). That IL-8 is partly involved in TNF-a-  but not in IL-lp-induced neutrophil recruitment (436) was  subsequently confirmed by Matsushima's group (437,  438).

Finally, MCP-1 was immunohistochemically detected in synovial lining cells and infiltrating  neutrophils, but the amounts of MCP-1 detected in SF from neutrophil-depleted rabbits were similar to those in normal rabbits, suggesting that synovial lining cells were the main  source of  MCP-1 detected  in  SF (439). Administration of  neutralizing anti-MCP-1 antibody inhibited  LPS-induced  monocyte  infiltration by 58.4%, suggesting that synovial production  of  MCP-1 plays an important role in the recruitment of monocytes in these arthritis models (439).

Yoshinaga and colleagues (440) investigated the  involvement of  TNFa, IL-lp, and IL-1RA in LPS-induced uveitis. Intravitreal injection of LPS in rabbits induced a massive leukocyte infiltration and protein leakage into the  aqueous  humor,  with  the  peak 24 hr  postinjection.  TNF-a, IL-la, and IL-1RA were significantly  augmented, and leukocyte-depletion studies showed that infiltrating leukocytes  were the major cellular sources of these cytokines. Further experiments revealed that TNF-a, and IL-lP were the

principal mediators of  LPS-induced uveitis and that endogenous  IL-  1 KA was  able to down-regulate inflammatory reactions (440).

Mori et (11. (441) examined by Northern  blot analysis the expression of 12 different  genes in  peritoneal  exndate neutrophils,  harvested  at  5 and 24 lir after  IP injection of casein in  rabbits. Though  rnRNA from  IL-la, TNF-a, and MCP-1 rnRNA was below detection levels during the entire inflammatory period  of  observation, the  remaining  nine  gene  products were  classified into  three  categories (441 ), The  first  group  included yactin, MRP-8, and MRP-14, the latter two being calcium-binding proteins and  coinporients of  a  complex  molecule with  inhibitory  activity against casein  kinase I and  11. These  messages were  constitutively expressed in hlood  neutrophils  and  were  also  rapidly  induced  after  emigration  into inflammatory sites. The second group of  gene products  included  IL-10, IL-8,  MIP-10, and  the  fMLP-H, which  were  induced  rapidly  after  the onset of inflamination (2-5  hr),  but returned to basal levels of expression by  24  hr.  The  functions  of  the  second  group  of  gene  products  relate especially to chemotaxis, one of  the  hallmarks of  early inflammation. To the  third  group of  expressed genes, only ferritin-related  inRNAs ( F   and H chains) were ascribed, because they were induced slowly (4-i hr) and increased with the progression of the inflarnmatory  process. This study not only  underlined  that  neutrophils  contribute  to  the  acute  inflainmatory reactions  by  synthesizing a variety  of  proteins  for it fitirly  long  period, but  also  evidenced  that  such  response  is  regulated  and  subjected  to  a programmed sequence. Expression of IL- 1 0  wiis in iigreeinent with previous findings reported by the same group, who, by using IH staining at the single-cell level, unequivocally proved that polyinorphonuclear leukocytes were the major cells synthesizing IL-1 following  casein-induced inflammation  in  rab6its (222, 223,  442). Furthermore,  an  IL-1-like  activity was prodiiced hy neutrophils obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage froin experiinentally inflamniet~  rat  lung.  Activity was  released  spontaneoiisly from neutrophils at high levels but it was enhanced by stimulation  with endotoxin in vitn) (220).

Yoshinaga's group analyzed the cytokine network involving TNF-a, IL10,  IL-8, and IL-1RA in a rabbit experimental model of acute gout (443). Though  the production  of  TNF-a  in  synovial  fluids  reached  a  peak  at 2 hr after intraarticular injection of monosodium urate crystals, the production  of  IL-1p  and  IL-8  occurred  in  two  phases,  the  first  at  2  hr  and the  second  at  9 and  12 hr, respectively. By  contrast,  tlie  production  of endogenous IL-1  RA reached  a peak at 9 hr (443). Infiltrating leukocytes,

including neutrophils, were the source of  IL-1P and  IL-1RA and of the second-phase IL-8 (443). Studies with specific neutralizing antibodies or other inhibitors demonstrated that IL-8 and TNF-a were independently produced  in  the  early stage  of  MSU  crystal-induced arthritis  and  were responsible for the production  of IL-lP and IL-lRA, whereas IL-lP was responsible for the second phase of  expression of  IL-lP and IL-8. Thus, the production kinetics of IL-8 and IL-10 in MSU crystal-induced arthritis was completely different from that observed in LPS-induced arthritis (see above) (435). Intravenous injection of'colchicine completely inhibited neutrophil infiltration and damage without affecting the prodnction  of TNFa or the first peak of IL-8, suggesting that colchicine inhibits MSU crystalinduced arthritis by directly inhibiting the migration of neutrophils (443). Further evidence on the pathogenic roles of locally produced IL-8 in rabbit MSU crystal-induced gouty arthritis has been provided by Nishiinura and colleagues (444), who detected immunoreactive IL-8 protein  in  synovial lining  cells  at 12-24 hr after thc MSU crystal  injection, and also  in infiltrated neutrophils in synovium ( 4 4 4 ) . MCP-1 was also detected in synovival lining cells and infiltrating neutrophils by iminunohistochemistry (439).  Production  of  MCP-I  in crystal-induced arthritis was  independent  of TNF-a or IL-1,  but  was  shown  to  play  an  important  role  in  the  recniitment  of nionocytes in this arthritis model (439).

In  work  aiming to  identify the  neutrophil cheinoattractants  generated in a model of myorcadial infarction in the rabbit, Ivey et al. (44,s) attributed important  roles to the complc~ment  fragment CSa and to IL-8. Ischemia induces  all  the  typical  changes  characteristic  of  an  acute  inflainniatory response, among which an early neutrophil  accumulation is a prominent feature. A determinant step in neutrophil accumulation is the local generation of chemical signals responsible for leukocyte recruitment. Neutrophil accumulation is  markedly accelerated  during reperfusion  after  ischemia, and early studies have implicated PMNs in the generation of tissue damage associated with reperfusion ( 4 4 6 ) . In their study, Ivey et nl. (445) dernonstrated  that  inmunoreactive  CSa  and  IL-8 were  present  in  myocardial tissue after ischemia and reperfusion, but the time course of their appearance was quite different. C h was detected after 5 min of the initiation of reperfusion, whereas IL-8 concentrations rose slowly and were significantly eIevated at 1.S  hr and were highest at 4.S hr, in dose parallel with leukocyte infiltration. Further experiments revealed that neutrophil depletion virtually abolished IL-8 generation  in  the  myocardium, but had no influence on CSa generation. Therefore, in this model, CSa was probably liberated from preformed substrates as early as a few minutes after the initiation of reperfusion and induced a first phase  of  neutrophil  infiltration. Once in the tissue, neutrophils became the source of IL-8 in the myocardium, and

this IL-8 generation was  responsible for a subsequent wave of neutrophil accumulation (445).

In studies attempting to clarify the mechanisms by which mononuclear cells  are  attracted  to  a  previously  ischemic  and  infarcted  myocardium, Youker and colleagues, in a dog experimental model, provided preliminary evidence that  even neutrophils  play  a  role  in  myocardial healing (447). What  is  more, in  this  study PMNs were  shown to  express IL-6  mRNA and protein, but the significance of  this was  not discussed (447).

Other findings have involved locally produced IL-8 as a pivotal mediator of cerebral reperfusion (448). Reperfusion of rabbit brain after a transient focal ischemia induced a perivascular neutrophil infiltration and aggregation as well  as tissue damage (448). Brain tissue levels of  IL-8 increased significantly at 6 hr  after  reperfusion,  without  a  noticeable  elevation of plasma IL-8 levels. IL-8 protein  was  detected by IH in the vascular wall and, to a lesser degree,  in infiltrated neutrophils. In addition, a neutralizing anti-IL-8 antibody significantly diminished neutrophil  infiltration and reduced brain  edema and infarct size in comparison to rabbits receiving a control antibody (448). As a whole, the results suggested not only a crucial role of neutrophil infiltration in this cerebral reperfusion injury model but also that  IL-8 might be considered as a novel target  for the  intervention of  this injury.

In a rat  model  of  transient  retinal  ischemia, a condition  that  leads  to neuronal  damage,  Hangai et nl. (449) studied  the  levels  of  IL-1  gene expression by semiquantiative RT-PCR,  and also used ISH and 113. Little expression of  IL-la and IL-1P genes was observed in normal retina, but this was  highly  up-regulated  after  ischemia and subsequent  reperfusion, in  a  time-dependent  manner (449). Time  courses  of  IL-la  and  IL-lfi mRNA expression were also different, in that induction of  IL-la mRNA occurred  before  that  of  IL-lP mKNA.  For  IL-10,  three  types  of  cells, including neutrophils, were identified as the cellular origin of  mRNA. The authors speculated that neutrophils recruited after ischemia are activated and consequently synthesize IL-1, which then promotes secretion of products that damage the inicrovasculature and retinal tissue (449).

In a rat  rnodel  of  lung injury obtained  by  IT instillation of  bleoniycin, which subsequently leads to fibrosis,  Sakanashi et nl. (450) investigated the kinetics and the molecular mechanisms underlying macrophage infiltr t'  011. ' 1 1 Northern  blot  analysis revealed that  the expression of  MCP-1 rnKNA  in the lung was  most prominent  the first day after instillation and declined thereafter, thus preceding the numerical change of the exudate rnonocytes. IH disclosed that the  main  sources of  MCP-1 productiou  were  alwolar and interstitial macrophages, as well a s PMNs (450). Based on these results, the  authors  speculated  that  MCP-1 produced  by  PMNs  and hy alveolar

and interstitial  macrophages induced the infiltration of  blood  monocytes in  the very early phase, and that the subsequent accumulation of macrophages  was  enhanced  by  the  MCP-1  production  by  monocyte-derived exudate macrophages (450). Under similar experimental conditions, erythromycin was shown to exert a prophylactic effect on the acute lung injury induced by intratracheal administration of bleomycin, an effect probably linked to a down-regulation of neutrophil-derived elastase and other mediators (cytokines?) (451).

An important component of the pathophysiologic  response to hyperoxia is  pulmonary  inflammation, although  the  roles  of  specific inflammatory mediators during pulmonary hyperoxia toxicity are not completely known. In  rabbits  exposed to  hyperoxia (452), a quantitative  ISH  of  BAL  cells showed that both  IL-8 and MCP-1 were expressed in AMs, whereas only IL-8 was present in recruited PMNs. Interestingly, IL-8 mRNA production in PMNs was elevated throughout the time that PMNs were available for analysis,  and although no data on IL-8 protein were provided, the presence of  increased levels of  IL-8 mRNA in  PMNs entering the alveolus implies an autocrine role for this cytokine in PMN activation (452). Other studies have focused on cytokine regulation during hyperoxic lung injury in adult and neonatal mice (453,454). In one study, lungs from adult mice assayed by Northern blot analysis displayed increased levels of IL-1P inRNA after 2 days of  hyperoxia, whereas  IL-la mRNA was  barely detectable (453). In situ hybridization and immunohistochemical analyses revealed an accumulation of IL-1P transcripts and protein in pulmonary interstitial macrophages and in a subset of neutrophils (453). In another study,  Johnston et al. (454) examined hyperoxic lung injury in neonatal and adult mice. Neonatal animals of  several species are more  tolerant  to hyperoxic exposure than are adults. However, the mechanisms of increased neonatal tolerance are unknown, as are the cell types that contribute to oxygen resistance. Adults and  neonatal  mice  were  exposed to  more  than  95% oxygen  for  78  hr and  10 days, respectively, and lung mRNA was  assayed by  ribonuclease protection  assays (RPA).  After 72 hr  of  exposure, the messages encoding TNF-a, IL-1P, and IL-6 were increased twofold in adult lungs. However, at  this  time  point  these  mice  were  dead  nearly dead.  No  alterations  in neonatal lung mRNA were detected until 7 days of  oxygen exposure. At that time neonatal mice demonstrated increases in lung mRNA encoding TNF-a, IL-lp, and IL-6 of three-, five-, and eightfold, respectively.  Acute alveolitis and slight edema were detected, but lethality was  not observed until  10 days of exposure. In situ hybridization in neonatal mice revealed an accumulation of TNF-a and IL-lP transcripts in pulmonary interstitial macrophages  and  in  a  subset  of  neutrophils  after  7  days  of  exposure. Messages  encoding  IL-la,  1L-2, IL-3, IL-4,  IL-5,  IL-10,  IFN-y,  and

LT-a  were  not  altered  in  either  adult  or  neonatal  mice controls  at  any time point examined. In conclusion, adult mice demonstrated little change in  cytokine  niRNA until  lethality was  imminent, whereas  newborn  mice demonstrated an acute induction of TNF-a, IL-lP, and IL-6 early in the development of  hyperoxic injury. A rapid cytokine response  early in  the development of liyperoxic injury may play an important role in the adaptation of  neonatal lungs to toxicity from prolonged oxygen exposure.

Using  the  model  of  antiglomerular  basement  membrane  (anti-GRM) nephritis in  rats, Wu et nl. (26) investigated the  mechanisms underlying in sitti chemokine expression and the in vivo function of these molecules during the acute phase of  this inflammatory model. Previous studies had established  that  CXC  chemokines are  important  for the  acute  influx  of PMNs in anti-GRM nephritis and the consequent damage to the glomerulus  (manifested as proteinuria) (455). Other studies had  also iinplicated CC chemokines in  the pathophysiology of  glomerulonephritis (456). Wu et (11. (26) described that during the evolution of anti-GBM nephritis, CXC chemokine expression (MIP-2 and CINC)  was monophasic and paralleled neutrophil influx, whereas CC chemokine expression (MIP-la, MIP-lP, and MCP-1) was biphasic, with peaks coinciding with the influx of  PMNs and  then  macrophages.  IL-lP and TNF-a  mHNA  expression exhibited features  intermediate  between  those  of  CXC  and  CC chemokines. The initial peak of chemokine expression was attenuated by decornplement  t'  on a i (which selectively attenuates PMN influx),  neutropenia (by cell depletion with a specific antiserum),  and irradiation-induced leukopenia. The delayed peak was attenuated only by leukopenia, but was augmented in the accelerated  form of  this disease model, corresponding to an increase in  iniicrophage influx. Differential expression of chemokines by PMNs and inacrophages was not an intrinsic property of these cells,  because these leukocytes expressed similar profiles of  chemokines in vitro, either after adherence or with endotoxin stimulation (26). In general, macrophage expression of chemokine mRNA was quantitatively more modest than in PMNs. IH for MIP-la in acute nephritis validated that expression during acute nephritis was accompanied by local protein production.  Moreover, neutralizing Abs to MIP-la attenuated the acute-phase proteinuria, but not the accompanying influx of  PMNs or macrophages. In comparison, neutralizing mAbs to CINC inhibited both  PMN influx and proteinuria. A combination of the two  antibodies was  not  significantly more  effective than  either antibody alone (26).  The study conclusively  established that myeloid cells are necessary for glomerular chemokine expression during nephritis,  and  that the differential expression of CXC and CC chemokines not only relates specifically to the differential influx of leukocyte subsets, but must involve additional Factors. In addition, this study argued against the simplified scheme

that CXC chemokines are mediators of acute inflammation,  and CC chemokines are mediators of chronic inflammation.

## C.  NEUTROPHLDERIVED CYTOKINES I N in Vivo INFECTIONS

In a  very interesting  study,  Jordan et al. (457) determined the  endogenous mediators involved in  the  induction  of  IL-1RA during oral  infection of mice with the enteropathogenic Y. enterocolitica. These bacteria initially proliferate in the tissue of the terminal ileum, predominantly in the Peyer's patches (PPs),  where the immediate antibacterial host defense is characterized by  an infiltration of granulocytes and monocytes. By  ISH, Northern blot, and IH, the authors found expression of IL-1RA mRNA and synthesis of  IL-1RA in PPs, as well as in noninfected organs such as spleen, but not in the liver (457). In contrast, the mRNA for IL-lP in PPs was expressed considerably earlier, because sessile macrophages were its primary source. No temporal differences were observed between IL-la and IL-1RA (457). Circulating and recruited neutrophils, but not PBMCs, were identified to be the primary source of  IL-1RA in tissues, whereas approximately 20% of the positive IL-1RA-staining  cells were accounted for by inflammatory macrophages.  In  addition,  ISH  of  adjacent  sections  of  PPs  revealed  a distinct hybridization pattern for each cytokine, suggesting that IL-la, ILlp, and IL-1RA were produced independently by different cell types, or alternatively  by cells of the same phenotype located within different tissue areas. Strikingly, neutralization with an antiserum of IL-6, a cytokine that was  also promptly induced by Y. enterocolitica infection, caused suppression of both IL-1RA mRNA in PPs and synthesis of IL-1RA in circulating neutrophils.  In  support of  these in  vivo findings, IL-6 induced  IL-1RA expression in cultures of macrophages and PMNs in vitro, and anti-IL-6 antiserum  blocked these effects of  IL-6 (457). In  this  respect, previous studies in humans had demonstrated that IL-6 infused into cancer patients rapidly increased the  levels of  circulating IL-1RA (458). Altogether, the observations of Jordan et al. (457) uncovered important interrelationships among IL-1, IL-6, and IL-1RA in Y.  enterocolitica infections. For example, after the production  of IL-1 and IL-6 early after Yersinia infection, IL-6 in turn induces IL-lFU, which then may inhibit IL-1 activities through a negative feedback loop, thus facilitating  the resolution of the inflammatory response locally and presumably at remote sites of infection.

More insights into the mechanisms underlying neutrophil influx in the airways during chronic bacterial infection were uncovered by  Inoue et al. (112), who  studied  the in  vivo effect  in  dog  trachea  of P.  aermginosa supernatants on the expression and localization of IL-8 mRNA in airways. Application of the supernatants stimulated IL-8 mRNA expression in epithelial and gland duct cells and in recruited neutrophils ( 1 12).  The molecule

responsible for  this  IL-8 induction  was  a small-molecular-mass (l-kDa) product  of P. aerugiriosa ( 1 12).  IL-8 expression in  recruited  neutrophils suggests a potential mechanism for amplifying the inflammatory response and  for a positive  feedback  of  a  protective  antibacterial  response,  for example, by rendering phagocytosis more effective.

Expression of TNF-a and IL-la transcripts, but not of  IL-6, in neutrophils elicited from L. monocytogenes-infected mice was demonstrated by Dai et al. (459).  These observations have been made in elicited peritoneal PMNs from IFN-y receptor-deficient (IFN-yR-'-) mice, used as a model to study the innate immune responses during infection with L. wwnocytogenes (459). In agreement with previous reports on the essential role of  IFN-y to limit bacterial spread, these mutant mice were unable to limit bacterial growth and died of sepsis even with an infection dose of seventy Listeria microorganisms.  The authors detected large inflammatory foci of infection in the spleen or liver of IFN-yR-/- mice; the foci were populated mainly by PMNs that, interestingly,  were fully able to kill Listeria (459).  Nevertheless, despite their fundamental contribution in innate immune responses against Listeria,  neutrophils  were  unable  to  rescue  mice  from  fatal  listeriosis, arguing for their limited protective role in IFN-yR-'-  mice.

Thomas and colleagues investigated the role of  neutrophils in herpetic stroinal keratitis (HSK) (460). HSK is  an immunopithologic response observed in iinmunocompetent mice after corneal infection with herpes simplex virus-1. The earliest sign of disease is a specific neutrophil infiltration, which lasts for 48 to 72 hr and then disappears. This rapid PMN response most likely contributes to curtailing viral replication, minimizing viral dissemination. In search of how PMNs exert antiviral effects, the researchers performed  ISH  experiments.  Preliminary  results  revealed  TNF-a  and iNOS signals in  cells resembling  PMNs in  acute inflamed cornea (460). These  molecules  might  thus  play  an  antiviral  activity  against HSV. In addition, results from  the same group showed that enriched PMNs from mice peritoneum  produce IL-12 on exposure to HSV (297).

Finally, Homani's group (291, 292) has provided fundamental information  on  the  role  of  neutrophils  in  the  generation  of  inurine  T  helper responses to C. albicans. It is well known that subsets of CD4' T helper cells can be characterized on the basis of their pattern of cytolune production either in mice (461)  or in human systems (53). h1 cells predominantly T produce  IL-2,  IFN-y, and  LT-a, and are effective inducers  of  delayedtype hypersensitivity (DTH),  whereas Th2 cells mainly produce IL-4, 11, S , and  IL-10 and provide more  effective help  for €3 cells.  Human  Thllike cells preferentially develop during infections by intracellular bacteria, protozoa, and viruses, whereas Th2-like cells predominate during helminthic infestations and in response to common environmental allergens (53).

Strongly polarized human Thl-type and Th2-type responses play different roles in  protection  and  can  also promote  different  immunopathological reactions ( 5 3 ) .

Candida albicans is a commensal microorganism that, especially in immunonocompromised hosts, may represent an important cause of morbidity  and  mortality. Studies  in  mice  have  clearly established  that  multiple mechanisms may  control the outcome of  experimental infections (462). In  immunized  mice  the  outcome  is  greatly conditioned  by  the  type  of predominant T helper cell subset activated by the initial exposure to the yeast:  Thl cell activation  leads to resistance and onset of durable protection, whereas Th2 cell responses are associated  with susceptibility  to progressive disease (462). Neutrophils  have a major  role in  providing a first  line  of defense in C. albicans infection (463,  464). Previous studies in  Homani's laboratory had indicated that numerous factors are involved in preferential induction of murine Thl or Th2 cell reponses to Candida (462). Cytokines emerged, obviously, as key regulators in the development of CD4'  subsets from precursor Th cells (462), and for the Thl responses several lines of evidence  indicated  production  of  IL-12  as  the  determinant (463, 465). Importantly, depletion  of  granulocytes in  resistant  mice led to the onset of  Th2  rather  than  Thl  responses,  indicating  that  the  latter  cells  may participate in Candida-driven Thl development (463). It is worth remembering here that neutropenia constitutes in humans one of the major factors responsible for fungal dissemination to visceral organs. Using a live vaccine strain or virulent challenge in mucosal or systemic infections of mice with C. albicans, Romani's group (291) initially  examined the effect of depletion of  neutrophils on the course of  primary and secondary challenge and on development of CD4+  cell-dependent immunity. They obtained evidence of  deleterious  effects  of  neutrophil  depletion  occurring  at  the  time  of infection under all conditions of  testing, both  in  naive and in  previously immunized  mice (292). Neutrophil  depletion  concurrent  with  infection also resulted  in  the  selective appearance of the IL-4 message in purified CD4'  splenocytes, an  early indicator of  Th2 development.  In  contrast, PMN depletion  appeared  to benefit  the  hosts  late  in  the  course  of  an overwhelming systemic infection.  In  an  attempt  to correlate  neutrophil function with  the  nature of  the T cell  response, the  authors  also tested the ability of neutrophils to produce cytokines associated  with functionally distinct CD4+  Th cell responses to Candida. They found that neutrophils were  endowed with  the capacity to  secrete  IL-12 and  IL-10 i n uitro in response  to  different  strains  of C. albicans  or  to  IFN-y  plus  LPS.  In particular, IL-10 and bioactive IL-12, but not IL-4, were found in cultures stimulated with  IFN-y plus LPS. IL-12 but  not  IL-10 was  produced  in response to the live vaccine strain PCA-2, which causes healing infection,

while the opposite pattern was observed in response to the highly virulent CA-6 strain, which causes nonhealing infection (291).  The authors therefore  concluded  that  neutrophil  ablation  early  in  the  coiirse  of  Th  1associated self-limiting infection appeared to change the qualitative development of tlie T cell response, and rendered mice susceptible to infection (292). Subsequcdy, the ability of neutrophils to release IL-12 and IL-  10 i n  vivo, diiring tlie course of C. albicnns systemic  infection, was investigated by injecting intravenously  the live vaccine strain PCA-2, or the CA-6 strain (292). Under those conditions, neutrophils expressed secreted 11,-12  and IL-10, correlating with  the respective development  of self-limiting (Tlilassociated) and  progressive (Th2-associated) disease  (292). Importantly, macrophages wcw  characterized  as  cells with  a  poor  ability  to  secretc IL-I0  and,  even  less,  IL-12  (293). Neutrophil  depletion  prevented  the developinent of protective Th1 responses in  healer  mice, but  exogenoiis IL-12  was effective  in protecting neutropenic hosts susceptible to infection, consistent with  a role  for  neutrophil-derived  IL-12 in Tlil  developmrmt (292).  Neutrophil depletion, however,  increased resistance later in infec.tion of  susceptible host, the latter finding being related  to a decreased Il,-lO production  (292). Another  very important  observation in  the  studies  of Hoinani arid colleagues was  that  the  balance  between  IL-I0  and 11,-12 production by neutrophils was modified by exogenous IL-12, in that PMN release of  IL-10 increased after  IL-12 treatment  in  both  uninfected and infected inice (292).  Although this IL-12-induced production of IL-10 by neutrophils might  have been the  result of  indirect  mecbators stimulating PMNs, this  mechanism  could act  as  a  regulatory response  to  challt.ngc with  11,-12.  In  addition,  such  an  effect  of  IL-12  might  accoiint  for an observation previously made by Komani's group of a paradoxical effect of IL-12 in  the  resistant  host. They in  fact  reported  that  administration of IL-12 not only fails to promote (enhance)  protective anticantlidal iininrinity in iiongranulocytopenic mice, but wtnally promoted Th2 development in a healing infection with detectal)le levels of  circulating IL1  WIL-4 (292). The increased production  of  IL-10 by nentrophils  aftcr IL-12 treatirient might be the explanation for this, or could contribute to tlie failure of  IL12  to exert protective effects in mice with candidiasis  (292).  An nnbalancc~d overproduction of IFN-y mediated by IL12 adniinistration has been  also proposed a s a factor that may lead to ;in enhanced susceptibility  to Candido infections (466). In  summary, the results of  Homani rt ul. (291, 292) are veiy important because they deinoristrate that PMNs, through the rc~lcwc~ of IL-12 tind 11 , 10, may significantly  contribute to the patterns of susceptibility and resistance in mice with candidiasis. Moreover, they indicate that neutrophils have not only an effector role in C. dbicans infection, Iiut also an iinmuiiomodulatory one, regulating Tlil and TI12 differentiation. More

strikingly, the work of  Roniani et al. (292,  295) has demonstrated for the first  time  that  neutrophils,  via  their  ability to  release  cytokines, play  an active role  in  determining the  qualitative development  of  the  T  cell  response (462). Further  evidence  for  an in  vivo role  of  IL-12-producing neutrophils  as  initiators of  a Th-1 cell-mediated immunity has been  observed in  response  to Toxoplasnm gondii or  in  the  IFN-yR-'-  mice,  as mentioned previously (467). All the latter concepts likely originated from the work of my group (12).

Romani's group has also uncovered a previously unappreciated  role for endogenous IL-4 to induce a protective antifungal CD4'  Thl response in mice with C. albicans infection (293). IL-4 deficient mice, while having an impaired Th2 response, did not default to the Thl pathway, thus becoming highly susceptible in the late stage of C. albicans infection (293). Defective IFN-y and IL-12 production, but not IL-12 responsiveness,  was observed in IL-4-deficient mice that failed to mount protective Thl-mediated acquired immunity in response to a live vaccine strain of  the yeast or on inucosal immunization in vivo. However, late treatment with exogenous IL-4, while improving  the outcome of infection, potentiated CD4+  Thl responses even in  the absence of  neutrophils.  In the same study, the authors found that IL-4 efficiently primed  neutrophils  for  IL-12 production  in  response  to the fungus,  and the effect was associated  with the induction of IL-4 receptor on these cells (293). Priming with IL-4 also resulted in the release of high levels  of IL-6 by neutrophils in vitro. The findings indicate that endogenous IL-4 is  required  for the induction  and  maintenance  of  IL-12-dependent protective antifungal responses, possibly  through combined activity  on cells of  the innate and adaptive immune systems.

Other studies from the same group reported  that  TNF/LT-a  doubledeficient  mice  are  more  susceptible  to  infection  caused  by  virulent  or low-virulence C. albicans cells, and this susceptibility correlates with  an impaired  development  of protective  Thl response (296). In  this  model, neutrophils from controls and TNFILT-a double-deficient mice produced comparable levels of bioactive IL-12 (296). This suggested that secretion of  IL-12 by  PMNs occurs independently of TNF signaling and that  the impaired development of protective antifungal Thl responses in TNFLTa-deficient mice occurs in spite of  IL-12 production (296). In contrast, a negative effect of excess iron on the antifungal effector functions of neutrophils and macrophages, and on the expression  of IL-  12  mRNA, particularly in neutrophils from infected mice, was found in another work (293). Iron overload  greatly  increased  susceptibility to  disseminated  infection  with low-virulence C. albicans cells (295). Therefore, it appeared that one likely mechanism by which iron overload increases the susceptibility to infection is  through inhibition of a directive cytokine, such as IL-12 (295).

## D. A ROLE  FOR NEUTROI'I~~L-DERIVED  INES  Onim CYTOK I N in Viuo EXPERIMENTAL  ELS MOD

Other studies have  indicated  that  the in uivo production  of  cytokines by PMNs may significantly affect other processes, for instance, the antitumor and immune response. In a series of papers published by Sendo and co-workers (468-472), for example, cell-mediated immune responses and antibody production were analyzed in  rats that were  depleted of  PMNs using  a  specific  antineutrophil monoclonal  antibody  designated RP-3. Those experiments demonstrated that both  the priming and the effector phases of delayed-type hypersensitivity to sheep red blood cells (SHBCs) (468) were  partially  inhibited  in  PMN-depleted  rats,  possibly  through inhibition of MNC recruitment in DTH (469,471), suggesting  that neutrophils enhance DTH to SHBCs. The same group previously demonstrated that  IL-&amp;induced  CD4+ T  lymphocyte  recruitment  into  subcutaneous tissues of  rats was  inhibited  by  the RP-3 treatment (471). Furthermore, by  assessing the direct  or indirect  splenic plaque-forming cell  (PFC) response to SRBCs in rats depleted of PMNs 6-12  hr before immunization, the authors detected an increased number of anti-SRBC antibody-producing cells (470). This phenomenon was observed only when the antigen was administered  intraperitoneally  and  not  with IV immunization (471) and suggested that neutrophils could suppress antibody production  in certain situations. More recently, they also showed that G-CSF administered at the elicitation phase enhances DTH response to SRBC and MNL recruitment (472). Using a similar experimental animal model, the  same  group  also demonstrated that transplantation immunity against cancer and generation of  CD8+  effector T cells in  response  to tumor-associated antigens were abrogated by  selective depletion  of  neutropliils (473, 474). Although the precise mechanisms underlying all these phenomena were not elucidated, it  can  be  envisaged  that  they  are  related  to  the  lack  of  PMN-derived cytokines.  These molecules would affect, for instance, antigen presentation (IL-I), lymphocyte  proliferation  and  activation  (IL-1, TNF-a), macrophage activation (TNF-a),  and leukocyte recruitment (IL-8, IP-10, MIG, MIP-ldMIP-1/3, CINC, and MIP-2).

The potential ability of  PMNs to mediate antitumor activity in uivo has been  clearly elucidated  by  Stopacciaro et  al. (151). They took advantage of  the murine colon adenocarcinoma C-26 cell line engineered to release G-CSF (C-26/G-CSF),  to study the mechanisms responsible for inhibition of  tumor uptake in  syngeneic animals, and of regression of an established tumor in sublethally irradiated mice injected with these cells. Using C-26/ G-CSF they identified  the  cell  types  that  infiltrate  the  turnor  and  the cytokines expressed i n situ. It  was found that inhibition of tumor uptake and

regression of an established tumor in sublethally irradiated mice occurred through different mechanisms. In the former case, PMNs were the main cells  responsible  for  inhibiting  the  uptake  of  C26/G-CSF.  In  the latter case PMNs, macrophages, and T cells, including CD8'  T cells, which are required for IFN-y-mediated tumor regression, determined the rejection of a C26/G-CSF nodule initially grown in sublethally irradiated mice. Both depletion of CD8+  T cells and neutralization of IFN-y produced by CD8' T cells resulted  in  a reduction  of  PMN number and TNF-a expression, and therefore  in  tumor  progression  (151).  Notably, as  evidenced  by  IH and  ISH,  either  newly  recruited  granulocytes surrounding the  injected neoplastic cells, or, in  sublethally irradiated mice, the  PMNs infiltrating the  C-26/G-CSF tumor during its initial growing phase, expressed transcripts for IL-la, IL-lp,  and TNF-a (151). In another study (475), analysis of the phenotypic changes resulting from cytokine activities during rejection of C26/G-CSF, and inhibition of such changes  by anti cytokine  antibodies,  indicated  that  TNF-a was  instrumental  in  tumor  regression.  C-26/ G-CSF regresssing tumors were  characterized  by  hemorrhagic  necrosis dependent on the infiltrating leukocytes and the cytotoxic cytokines they produced (475). Complete tumor regression was the result of  tumor cell hypoxia following damage of the tumor microvasculature, which was the target  of  the  cytotoxic cytokines (TNF-a) and  the  PMNs (475). Locally produced  IL-1 and TNF-a induced VCAM-1 and  E-selectin  on  tumor vessels, and thus indirectly attracted T lymphocytes (475). Treatment with monoclonal antibodies to IFN-y or TNF-a blocked tumor regression by inhibiting VCAM-1 and E-selectin expression on tumor-associated endothelial cells,  and this resulted in a reduced number of infiltrating  leukocytes. Thus, whereas  tumor  inhibition was  mediated  mainly by  PMNs,  tumor regression occurred because of the cooperation of  PMNs and T cells, as well as of a combination of cytokines, for which T cell-derived IFN-y and PMN-derived TNF-a were necessary.

Neutrophil  production  of cytokines in vim is  implicated in  other processes. For  instance,  in  studies  aiming to  elucidate  the pathogenesis  of pulpitis and apical periodontitis, Tani-Ishii et al. (476) identified cells that express IL-la and TNFa-  in infected pulps and in developing rat periapical lesions after surgical pulp exposure.  As detected by immunohistochemistry, IL-la and TNF-a positive cells were present as early as 2 days after pulp exposure in  both  the pulp  and the  periapical region (476). In  contrast, cells  expressing IL-lp and  LT-a were  not  found  in  pulp  or periapical lesions during this period. Cells expressing IL-la and TNF-a were identified  primarily as macrophages  and  fibroblasts, with  occasional  staining of  PMNs (476). Osteoblasts  and  osteoclasts were  also positive, whereas lymphocytes were negative. In general, cytokine-expressing  cells were lo-

cated proximal to abscesses  and the root apex (476). The data demonstrated that  resident connective tissue cells, as well as  infiltrating leukocytes, express bone-resorptive  cytokine in  response  to  infection in  these  lesions. Expression of IL-la and TNF-a in neutrophils infiltrating early periapical lesions of normal and immunodeficient mice was subsequently confirined (477) and its importance  further demonstrated (478).

The importance of  IL-lp in the pathogenesis of  acute pancreatitis has been demonstrated by dramatic attenuation of pancreatic destruction and significant increases in survival when its actions are inhibited. Hypothesizing that infiltrating  leukocytes  contribute substantially  to the intrapancreatic  production  of  IL-lp, Fink  and  Norman (479) examined the  specific role of  those cells. Mice were assigned to one of four groups 48 hr prior to induction of pancreatitis: (1)  PMN depletion via antimiirine PMN antiserum (PMN-tl), (2) macrophage (Mqh) depletion via antimacrophagc antiserum (M+d)(3) PMN and Mqhdepletion [PMN + M+d],  and (4) immunocompetent pancreatitis.  Edematous  pancreatitis  was  then  induced in  all experimental groups by caerulein, and intrapancreatic  IL-  1 0  production was  determined  by  IH and RT-PCR (479). The experiments performed by  these authors demonstrated that intrapancreatic IL-lp production was primarily attributable to  the  leukocytes infiltrating the  gland  during the progression of  the disease. IH techniques suggested that the macrophage was  the major contributor of  IL-1 protein. On the other hand, there was greater attenuation of  IL-1 inHNA levels in  animals that were devoid of neutrophils (479). Elimination of either macrophages or neutrophils  (and their  inflammatory products, including IL-10) could thus  have beneficial effects and significantly decrease the severity of pancreatic destruction.

To obtain  greater  insights into  the  pattern  of  cytokine exprcwion  in wound tissues, and in their regulation during the repair process, Hubner and colleagues (480) have been able to show a strong and early induction of  IL-la, IL-lp, and TNF-a expression after cutaneous injury in normal mice.  The  highest  levels  of  these  cytokines were  seen  as  early  as  1224 hr  after wounding, and after completion of the proliferative phase of wound healing, mHNA levels of these cytokines returned to the lmal level. Remarkably, during  the  early  phase  of  wound  repair,  proinflammatory cytokines were predominantly expressed in  PMNs. At  later stages of  the repair process, expression of  IL-la, IL-lp, and of  TNF-a was  also seen in inacrophages. Induction of these cytokines after injury was significantly reduced during wound repair  in  healing-impaired glucocorticoid-treated mice (480). These findings demonstrate  that wound  healing defects  itre associated  with impaired IL-la, IL-10, and TNF-(r expression and suggest that  early induction of  these  genes is  important  for normal repair. More importantly, the data provide evidence for a novel function of  PMNs as

regulators of  inflammatory process and as initiators of  proliferative processes. This hypothesis was  supported by the colocalization of  cytokineexpressing  PMNs  and,  for  example,  KGF-expressing fibroblasts at  the wound edge. Thus, the early expression of proinflammatory cytokines by PMNs that invade the wound seems to be of major significance for induction of growth fktor  expression and thus for the initiation of wound repair.

In another model of locd wounding response secondary to spinal cord injury in  mice,  Bartholdi et ul. (482) investigated the expression pattern of  proinflammatory and chemoattractant cytokines. They could show by ISH that transcripts for TNF-a and IL-1 as well as MIP-la and MIP-1P were  up-regulated  within  the  first  hour  following injury.  In  this  early phase, expression of the proinflammatory cytokines was restricted to cells, probably resident CNS cells, in the area surrounding the lesion. Though TNF-a was expressed in a very early time window, IL-1 could be detected in  a  subset  of  PMNs  that  immigrated into the  spinal cord  around 6 hr. Messages for the chemokines MIP-ldP were expressed in a generalized way in the grey matter of  the entire spinal cord around 24 hr and again were restricted to the cellular infiltrate at the lesion site at 4 days following injury. The data suggest that resident CNS cells, most probably microglial cells, and not peripheral inflammatory cells, are the main source for cytokine and chemokine mRNA (482). The temporal  mRNA expression patterns  for  TNF-a, IL-1P,  IL-6,  M-CSF,  and  TGF-P1 in two rat  injury models with very different  cellular inflammatory reactions have been assessws;  in particular, contusion of the spinal cord and axotomy of the facial nerve were investigated (482). Comparative analyses  using semiquantitative RT-PCR  show an early and robust but transient up-regulation of  IL-lD, TNF-a, IL-6, and M-CSF mRNA in spinal cord after contusion injury. In contrast, expression of  IL-lP and TNF-a mRNA in the axotomized facial nucleus was minimal and delayed, and levels of  M-CSF mRNA remained unaltered. Similar to injured spinal cord, the axotomized nucleus showed a dramatic and early up-regulation of IL-6 mRNA, but unlike spinal cord, IL-6  mRNA  levels  subsided  only  gradually. Both  injury  types  showed gradually increasing levels of TGF-P1 mRNA that were maximal at 7 days postinjury. RT-PCR  analyses  were also performed on isolated blood-borne mononuclear cells and neutrophils and showed that these cells contained high levels of IL-1P and M-CSF mRNA, moderate levels of TGF-P1 and TNF-a mRNA, and minimal levels of  IL-6 mRNA. However, RT-PCR analyses together with histological observations indicated that expression of  the proinflamniatory cytokines IL-lP, TNF-a, and IL-6 is  short-lived and self-limited after contusion injury, and that it occurs primarily within endogenous glial cells.

Last, the time course of appearance of the TGF-P and its localization in developing  endochondral bone was examined by Carrington and colleagues (18).  These authors used the demineralized matrix-induced bone-forming system  in  rats.  For  the  first  time,  TGF-/3 was  detected  in  developing endochondral bone in viva Intracellular immunohistochemical localization of TGF-P revealed that the cell types in which TGF-P could be detected varied with the time after implantation of  the demineralized  matrix: first were inflammatory  cells, and then cells  in late hypertrophying and calcifying cartilage, i.e.,  the osteoblasts and, interestingly, also bone marrow granulocytes (18). Therefore, production of TGF-/3  by granulocytes may contribute to the regulation of  ossification during endochondral bone development.

## VIII.  Concluding Remarks

The classic role attributed  to neutrophils is  still based on the obsolete view that PM Ns are terminally differentiated, short-lived cells, with minimal (if any) transcriptional or translational activity. However, the studies summarized in  this  review clearly demonstrate the ability of  neutrophils to synthesize and release various cytokines.  Moreover, the fact that neutrophils clearly predominate over other cell types under various in vivo conditions suggests that, at least under some circumstances, the contribution of PMN-derived cytokines can be of  foremost importance. In  this respect, there  already exists evidence suggesting that under some circumstances, the contribution of PM N-derived cytokines can be of foremost importance to the evolution of  certain pathologies.

Within the field of neutrophil-derived cytokines, one of the facets that, in my opinion, urgently needs to be further elucidated is the identification of  all the stimuli that are able to induce cytokine synthesis in neutrophils. It  has  become  clear  that  the  interaction  of  PMNs  with  a  given  agonist produces  a characteristic response,  thus  such studies  might prove  to be especially helpful in understanding the pathogenesis of diseases in which neutrophils represent (or  are presumed to be) the first cell type encountering, and interacting with, the  etiologic agent.  For example, the  influx of the different leukocyte populations to inflammatory  lesions might very well reflect the individual  chemokines being produced by neutrophils: IL-8 and GRO-cr predominantly recruit neutrophils, whereas MIP-lcu/P, IP-10, or MIG essentially recruit  monocytes and lymphocyte subtypes. Thus, depending  on  the  nature  of  the  primary  insult,  and  its  effect  toward  the production of chemokines by neutrophils, the evolution of a given type of inflammatory reaction may be anticipated.

Another very important aspect that, to date, has been  mostly ignored by investigators  working in the field of cytokine production by neutrophils

is  the  potential  involvement of  transcription  factors in  the  regulation of cytokine gene transcription. This partially reflects the fact that very little is known about the transcriptional events that control cytohne and chemokine gene expression  in PMNs. However,  the inhibitory effects of actinomycin  D  toward the  inducible  accumulation of cytokine mRNA in  PMNs, and  a  limited  amount  of  direct  evidence  (see Section VI), suggest that transcriptional events might play a central  role in  this process.  Many of the regulatory elements located in the promoter regions of most cytokines, as well as the families of transcription factors that bind to them and control their transcription, have been well identified and characterized in various cell  types.  However, there  can exist  substantial differences  in  the  exact pattern of transcription factor binding, depending on the cell type. Thus, performing such studies in  PMNs could represent  a step forward in our understanding of  the cell-specific regulation of  cytokine gene expression. Among other things, these studies could lead to the identification of novel transcription  factors,  and  eventually  neutrophil-specific  factors (483). Moreover, they could potentially elucidate the molecular bases of the many qualitative and quantitative differences observed between neutrophils and monocytes in terms of  their ability to produce individual cytokines, such as  IL-6, IL-12, IP-10, and so forth. Finally, the expression of  neutrophil transcription factors could be the result of a regulated myeloid differentiation program, which in certain hematopoietic diseases or malignancies  may be altered. In a broader context, studies addressing the mechanisms that regulate  the  intracellular  distribution  and  release  of  cytokines are very scarce, both in neutrophils and other cell types. The need for such studies is best illustrated considering that they would advantageously  complement the  considerable knowledge already accumulated  on  cytokine gene  and protein  expression. In this regard, we recently found that neither STATl nor STAT3 is tyrosine phosphorylated in response to stimulation with IL10 in neutrophils (484), whereas in autologous PBMCs, we confirmed that IL-10  rapidly triggers  the  phosphorylation of  both  proteins  on  tyrosine residues, as previously reported (485-488). Under appropriate stimulatory conditions, however, both STATl and STAT3 can undergo tyrosine phosphorylation in  neutrophils (484, 489). The reasons for which IL-10 does not trigger tyrosine phosphorylation of STATl and STAT3 in neutrophils remain  unknown, but  our  data  make  it  likely  that,  in  neutrophils,  the activation of  STATl and STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation is not required for the modulatory effects of  IL-10 toward cytokine production (4, 289). More importantly, our results also raise the possibility that the regulation of cytokine generation by IL-10 in other cell types might also occur independently of STAT protein activation.

An  increasing body  of  evidence,  mainly derived  from in  vitro studies, indicates that  PMN survival can be  greatly extended  following exposure to microenvironinental signals, such as LPS, inactivated streptococci, ILlp, TNF-a, IL-6, IFN-y, G-CSF, and GM-CSF (202,203). These obsewations raise the possibility that  PMN viability in vivo may be considerably greater than what has been heretofore believed. If so, the ability ofneutrophils to synthesize iminunomodulatory cytokines could prove to be a phenomenon of  considerable pathophysiological importance. In  any case, it has become clear that PMNs should be considered not only as active and central  elements  of  the  inflammatory response,  but  also  as  cells  that, through cytokine secretion,  may  significantly influence the direction  and evolution of the inflammatory and immune processes. In such a scenario, PMNs would play a pivotal role in regulatory interactions between innate resistance (mediated by phagocytic cells and NK cells) and adaptive inimunity (mediated by T and B cells).  In addition, recent studies have indicated that  PMNs can syntliesize and express M H C  class I1 molecules on their surfice (490,  491; our unpublished  observations), and there is  now even evidence showing that PMNs are capable of  supporting T cell activation by bacterial superantigens (492). Furthermore, highly purified lactoferrinpositive  precursors of end-stage PM  Ns cultured with the cytokine  combination  GM-CSF plus  IL-4  and  TNF-a  were  shown  to  develop  dendritic cell morphology, and to acquire features characteristic of  dendritic cells, including potent T cell-stimulating activity in allogeneic, as well as autologous,  mixed lymphocyte  reactions  (MLRs) (493). Surprisingly,  these neutrophil-derived dendritic cells were found to be at least  10,000  times more efficient in presenting soluble antigen to autologous T cells, relative to  freshly isolated monocytes (493). This therefore  raises  the  possibility that  PMNs might have the ability to initiate a cellular iinmune response. This putative function of neutrophils would again imply an important  role of  these cells in  many pathological conditions.

Although relatively novel, research  addressing cytokine production  by neutrophils has brought forward new and exciting discoveries. In view of the variety of cytokines and chemokines secreted by neutrophils, it can be envisaged that  PMNs can  orchestrate the  infiltration of  leukocytes into sites of injury, and therefore determine the evolution of the host response. This being said, it is still premature to assess the true biological significance of  cytokine production by neutrophils. Even though our understanding of cytokine production by PMNs is far from complete, particularly in humans in vivo, its full appreciation is  likely to yield valuable clues as to potential therapeutic approaches designed to control various disorders known to be influenced  by PMNs. In vivo studies will ultimately  be essential for critically

testing specific hypotheses about the biological impact of neutrophil cytokine production in health and disease.
