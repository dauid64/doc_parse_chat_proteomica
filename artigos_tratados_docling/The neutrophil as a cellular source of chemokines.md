## The neutrophil as a cellular source of chemokines

Summary: Neutrophils are known to play an important role in inflammatory responses by virtue of their ability to perform a series of effector functions that collectively represent a major mechanism of innate immunity against injury and infection. In recent years, however, it has become obvious that the contribution of neutrophils to host defence and natural immunity extends well beyond their traditional role as professional phagocytes. Indeed, neutrophils can be induced to express a number of genes whose products lie at the core of inflammatory and immune responses. These include not only Fc receptors, complement components, cationic antimicrobial  and  NADPH  oxidase  proteins,  but  also  a  variety  of  cytokines (including tumour necrosis factor/G61 ,  interleukin  (IL)-1 /G62 ,  IL-1R /G61 ,  IL-12 and vascular  endothelial  growth  factor),  and  chemokines  such  as  IL-8, growth-related gene product, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1 /G61 , MIP-1 , interferon- -inducible protein of 10 kDa and mono/G62 /G67 kine  induced  by  interferon- .  Because  these  chemokines  are  primarily /G67 chemotactic for neutrophils, monocytes, immature dendritic cells and Tlymphocyte subsets, a potential role for neutrophils in orchestrating the sequential recruitment of distinct leukocyte types to the inflamed tissue is likely to occur. The purpose of this review is to summarize the essential features of the production of chemokines by polymorphonuclear neutrophil leukocytes and the contribution that we have made to characterize some aspects of this newly discovered crucial function of neutrophils.

## Introduction

Chemokines represent a group of structurally related cytokines whose importance in inflammatory processes is best illustrated by their ability to specifically recruit discrete leukocyte subpopulations (1-3). Members of this large family of molecules typically consist of 8 to 14 kDa proteins sharing 20 to 70% homology in amino acid sequences. Despite the structural diversity of chemokines,  their  receptors  are  invariably  seven  transmembrane-spanning receptors that signal through G protein interactions (1-3). More than 40 chemokines have now been identified in humans, and it is becoming evident that these proteins play fundamental roles not only in coordinating the immune system responses, but also in B and T -cell development and in the modulation of angiogenesis (4). Based upon the positions of the first two cysteine residues in their primary sequences, chemokines have been classified into two major groups: the C-

X-C and the C-C subfamilies (1-3). The C-X-C chemokines can be further subdivided into two classes depending on the presence of the glutamate-leucine-arginine (ELR) motif preceding the first two cysteines (1-3). Members expressing this motif are generally chemotactic for neutrophils and also have angiogenic properties (1-3). These chemokines include interleukin (IL)-8, the prototype, growth-related gene product (GRO) /G20 /G61 , GRO , GRO , epithelial cell-derived and neutrophil-activating /G62 /G67 78-amino acid peptide (ENA-78), neutrophil-activating peptide  (NAP)-2  and  other  members  (1, 2).  In  contrast,  C-X-C chemokines  that  lack  the  ELR  sequence,  such  as  interferon (IFN)- -inducible /G67 protein of 10  kDa  (IP-10), monokine induced by IFN-  (MIG) and IFN-inducible T-cell /G67 /G61 chemoattractant (I-TAC) (5, 6), fail to attract polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN), but act on T lymphocytes and exert angiostatic activities (5, 6). The C-C subfamily includes monocyte chemotactic proteins (MCP)-1 through MCP-5, RANTES, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1 /G61 , -1 /G62 and -1 , eotaxin and oth/G67 ers,  and  are  predominantly  chemotactic  and  stimulatory  for monocytes,  macrophages,  dendritic  cells,  lymphocytes,  NK cells, eosinophils and basophils (1-3). Two additional recently discovered chemokines do not share the structural features of the  C-X-C  and  C-C  classes,  and  likely  represent  members  of additional families: lymphotactin and fractalkine (3, 4). Lymphotactin lacks cysteines one and three of the typical chemokine structure, whereas fractalkine is a membrane-bound glycoprotein in which the first two cysteine residues are separated by three amino acids (C-XXX-C) and the chemokine domain sits on a mucin-like stalk (3, 4).

Our group and other researchers have clearly established that, under appropriate in vitro experimental conditions, human neutrophils  can  synthesize  and  secrete  a  number  of  chemokines, including IL-8 (7, 8), GRO /G61 (9), MIP-1 /G61 (10), MIP-1 /G62 (11), IP-10 (12) and MIG (13). The capacity of neutrophils to express the genes for I-TAC (13) and GRO /G62 (14) has also been reported, but no information on their secretion is available yet. In contrast, expression of the MCP-2, MCP-3, RANTES or I-309 gene  product  was  undetectable  in  stimulated  PMN  (15). Finally , contradictory findings have been reported on the ability of neutrophils to express MCP-1 in vitro (8, 15-18), a situation that  clearly  requires  further  investigation.  A  comprehensive, chemokine by chemokine description of the experimental conditions observed to induce chemokine production by neutrophils, and of the manner whereby chemokine release is immunologically modulated or regulated at the molecular level, is already available (19). What follows, instead, is an up-to-date overview of the fundamental findings in the field.

## Chemokine production by neutrophils in vitro

The first chemokine shown to be produced by neutrophils, and certainly the most studied, is IL-8. It is worth recalling that neutrophils are not only producers, but also the primary targets for IL-8,  responding  to  this  mediator  by  chemotaxis,  release  of granule  enzymes,  respiratory  burst  activity ,  upregulation  of adhesion molecules expression on the surface, and increased adherence to unstimulated endothelial cells (1, 2). Two receptors for IL-8 are expressed in neutrophils, namely CXCR1 and CXCR2, the latter being also used by NAP-2 and GRO family members (1, 2, 20). IL-8 is also chemotactic for basophils and T-lymphocyte  subsets,  although  much  less  potently  than  for neutrophils, and is reportedly an angiogenic factor (3).

The initial demonstration that PMN themselves can express and release biologically relevant amounts of active IL-8 after exposure to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or phagocytosis of Saccharomyces cerevisiae opsonized with IgG (Y-IgG) already goes back to 10 years ago (7, 8). Since then, dozens of papers have followed (and still continue to appear in the literature) that not only confirm and extend these original findings but also uncover novel characteristics  of  the  production  of  IL-8  by  neutrophils.  For instance,  it  is  now  well  established  that  the  stimuli  able  to induce this response also include, besides classical neutrophil agonists, many other classes of biological agents. Suffice to say that cytokines and growth factors (such as tumour necrosis factor  (TNF)/G61 ,  IL-1 /G62 ,  IL-15,  granulocyte-macrophage  colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and thrombopoietin), chemoattractants (including N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP), activated complement component 5, platelet-activating factor and leukotriene B4), particulate agents like microcrystals (monosodium urate and calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate), proteolytic enzymes, surface molecules, various bacteria, fungi, protozoa, viruses and products derived from these microorganisms, all possess the capacity to trigger the secretion of copious amounts of IL-8 by neutrophils (reviewed in (19)). According to the current data, IL-8 ranks amongst the neutrophil-derived products which are synthesized in larger amounts (in the order of ng/ml as opposed to pg/ml for most other chemokines  or  cytokines)  (21).  The  lesson  that  we  have learned from all these observations is that the release of IL-8 by neutrophils seems to represent a stereotyped response of these cells, occurring as soon as these cells interact with any sort of ligand or contact foreign particles. The most obvious speculation explaining such a response is that a prompt release of IL-8 would represent a feedback mechanism to ensure greater numbers of PMN to inflammatory foci, with proper exception (22). Alternatively , neutrophil-derived IL-8 may serve to immobilize

the cells that are already present in the inflamed tissue, through receptor desensitization. Although there is no doubt that IL-8 is synthesized de novo and released into the surrounding medium in response to a given stimulus, it has also been demonstrated that the greater part of newly made IL-8 remains cell associated (23-25). Intracellular IL-8 may potentially serve as a reservoir, with a paracrine signalling function when apoptotic neutrophils are cleared by macrophages.

Our studies have mostly focused on the immunoregulatory and  molecular  mechanisms  governing IL-8 gene  expression and production in neutrophils. It must be underlined that due to  the  difficulty  (or  even  the  impossibility)  of  extending  to neutrophils  many  of  the  new  molecular  biology  techniques used in other cell types, our advance has sometimes been limited. Nonetheless, it has been unequivocally established that the production of IL-8 by neutrophils is typically preceded by (and largely dependent upon) an accumulation of the corresponding mRNA transcripts,  and  that  depending  on  the  experimental condition, IL-8 gene expression is regulated at transcriptional, post-transcriptional  and/or  post-translational  steps  (11,  23, 26).  In  addition,  we  (27-29),  and  others  (30-33),  have recently reported that the transcription factor NF/G6b B is activated by many of the same stimuli that elicit the production of IL-8 (and  other  chemokines/cytokines)  in  neutrophils.  In  this regard, studies aimed at the identification of promoter sequences mediating chemokine gene induction in neutrophils would represent an important and timely undertaking, helping to explain the selective chemokine expression in neutrophils under particular conditions (see below).

Another C-X-C chemokine secreted by human neutrophils is GRO /G61 . Like IL-8, GRO /G61 has powerful chemotactic and activatory properties on PMN (via CXCR2), including degranulation, increased expression of adhesion molecules and in vivo recruitment of neutrophils to the sites of injection (1, 2). To date, GRO  has been shown to be produced by human neutrophils /G61 (in  the  range  of  pg/ml)  after  phagocytosis  of  Y-IgG,  in response to LPS, TNF/G61 , GM-CSF, fMLP , microcrystals, or after activation with Mycobacterium tuberculosis and lipoarabinomannan (one of the major cell wall components of M. tuberculosis ) (19). We also showed that the extracellular release of GRO /G61/G20 did not always correlate with changes in GRO /G61 mRNA expression, suggesting that GRO /G61 production by PMN might be regulated at the  post-transcriptional,  translational  and  post-translational level (9). It should finally be noted that in neutrophils of species other than human there is evidence that various members of the GRO family are also expressed (34-36). Taken together, these studies suggest that the generation of GRO /G61 (and possibly GRO ) (14) by neutrophils may contribute to stimulating the /G62

recruitment  and  activation  of  further  neutrophils  at  sites  of inflammation. A simultaneous synthesis of IL-8 and GRO /G61 is one of the classical examples of functional redundancy observed within certain classes of related chemokines (1-3).

Of considerable importance have been the studies showing the ability of appropriately stimulated neutrophils to secrete not only other members of the C-X-C chemokine family , namely IP10 and MIG (12, 13), but also MIP-1 /G61 and MIP-1  (10, 11), /G62 two C-C chemokines. In view of the cellular targets of IP-10, MIG, MIP-1 /G61 and  MIP-1 , these studies not only support the /G62 notion that PMN may potentially recruit leukocytes other than neutrophils, but also extends the list of potentially redundant chemokines  produced  by  these  cells.  In  fact,  MIG  and  IP-10 (and I-TAC as well) constitute a group of strongly related C-X-C chemokines that all act on a single receptor, called CXCR3 (5, 6). Strikingly , CXCR3 seems to be preferentially expressed on activated T lymphocytes of the T -helper type I (Th1) phenotype (37). In regard to MIP-1 /G61 and MIP-1 , these chemokines dis/G62 play extensively overlapping biological activity , acting as potent chemotactic/activating  factors  for  monocytes,  macrophages, natural  killer  (NK)  cells  and  immature  dendritic  cells  (1-3). Importantly , it was recently reported that MIP-1 /G61 and MIP-1 /G62 serve as chemoattractants for Th1 but not Th2 cells (38).

According to the studies  published  to  date,  MIP-1 /G61 and MIP-1  are released by neutrophils in response to various ago/G62 nists,  including  LPS,  TNF/G61 ,  eosinophil  major  basic  protein, several bacteria, fungi, protozoa, viruses and related microorganism products (19). In contrast, the expression and production of IP-10 and MIG (and the mRNA expression of I-TAC) seems to be more selectively regulated. In fact, the release of IP10 and MIG in substantial amounts requires a co-stimulation of PMN with IFN-  along with either LPS or TNF/G67 /G61 (12, 13). Message stability analyses demonstrated that IP-10 mRNA isolated from PMN stimulated with IFN-  alone, or in combination with /G67 either TNF/G61 or LPS, had similar half lives (12). Furthermore, a significant release of IP-10 by neutrophils may be obtained even if PMN are stimulated with IFN/G61 in association with LPS, TNF-  or IL-1  (13). Strikingly , IFN-  alone, which by itself /G61 /G62 /G67 represents a very efficient agonist of IP-10, MIG and I-TAC production in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) (5, 6, 12,  13),  proved  to  be  ineffective  toward  the  extracellular release  of  IP-10  and  MIG  by  neutrophils  (12,13).  The  latter findings suggest that the mechanisms governing the expression of MIG, IP-10 and I-TAC in neutrophils and PBMC are specific and subjected to distinct regulatory pathways. To this end, it will be crucial to determine whether the activation of distinct patterns of transcription factor binding to promoter elements

represent the key mechanisms governing the differential induction of IP-10, MIG and I-TAC in the various leukocyte types.

As in the case of IL-8 (7), MIP-1 /G61 ,  IP-10 and MIG have been detected in the neutrophil supernatants not only by measuring their antigenicity , but also by demonstrating their actual biological activities.  For  instance,  cell-free  supernatants  from human PMN stimulated with increasing concentrations of LPS were demonstrated to possess a dose-dependent chemotactic activity for human monocytes, that was significantly attenuated (by approximately 60%) in the presence of neutralizing antihuman MIP-1 /G61 antibodies (10). Similarly , we found that supernatants  harvested  from  IFN-   plus  TNF/G67 /G61 -  or  LPS-stimulated PMN exerted chemotactic activities towards CXCR3-expressing lymphocytes and triggered rapid integrin-dependent adhesion of phytohaemogglutinin/IL-2-activated T lymphocytes to fibronectin (13). All of these effects were consistent with the presence of IP-10 and MIG in neutrophil culture supernatants since they were substantially blocked by anti-MIG and anti-IP10 neutralizing antibody (13). We did not test whether supernatants derived from IFN-  plus LPS- or TNF/G67 /G61 -stimulated PMN possess anti-angiogenic properties, but this will be ascertained in future experiments.

Table 1 summarizes the effects of the most widely used agonists  on  the  release  of  neutrophil-derived  chemokines.  Although  the  current  knowledge  concerning  the  full  ability  of each stimulus to induce the generation of chemokines is not complete, it is evident that the pattern and the magnitude of chemokine release by neutrophils are conditioned by the stimulus. For instance, Y-IgG, LPS and TNF/G61 induce the release of IL-8, GRO /G61 and MIP-1 /G61/G2c/G20 while GM-CSF and fMLP seem to induce the production only of IL-8 (19). Among these stimuli, Y-

IgG represents the most potent agonist for IL-8 and GRO /G61 release, whereas LPS is the most powerful agonist for MIP-1 /G61 secretion. In the case of IP-10 and MIG, co-stimulation of neutrophils with IFN-  and either LPS or TNF/G67 /G61 is required to achieve high levels of gene expression, while any of these stimuli used individually is either ineffective or (in the case of IFN- ) only /G67 weakly effective (12, 13). In addition, IFN-  enhances (9, 23, /G67 39) and IL-10 inhibits (9, 40, 41) the production of IL-8, GRO /G61 and MIP-1 /G61/G2f 1  in neutrophils treated with LPS for 21 h. The lat/G62 ter effects reflect another important phenomenon, which is that chemokine production by PMN depends not only on the stimulus, but also on the 'functional' state of the cell at the moment of receiving a given stimulus (21).

## Cytokine networks regulating neutrophil-derived chemokines

The majority of the studies addressing the control of chemokine production by PMN have been conducted using LPS as a stimulus, probably because it is a potent inducer of chemokine production  in  several  cell  types.  Some  of  these  studies  have revealed that the kinetic profiles of IL-8, GRO /G61 ,  MIP-1 /G61 and MIP-1  release by LPS-stimulated PMN are very similar (21). /G62 Typically , the extracellular release of these chemokines starts as early as after 1 h, slowly increases for up to 5-6 h, and then dramatically rises up to 18-24 h of stimulation (9, 11, 39, 40). Studies performed in our laboratory (23, 40) and elsewhere (39) have uncovered the mechanisms underlying such kinetics and  have  revealed  the  potential  existence  of  a  PMN-centred cytokine  network  (42).  Essentially ,  the  initial  (up  to  5-6  h) release of chemokines derives from a direct (transcriptional) effect of LPS, whereas the second delayed phase is mainly mediated  by  the  endogenous  production  of  TNF/G61 in  an  autocrine/paracrine  manner;  LPS-stimulated  IL-1 /G62 also  serves  as endogenous mediator, acting synergistically with TNF/G61 (40). Interestingly , other experimental conditions have been reported to have analogies with the above-described network, for instance in the case of neutrophils stimulated with Cryptococcus neoformans (43) or with Toxoplasma gondii antigen (44). However,  the  autocrine  role  of  endogenous  TNF /G2d/G61 in  mediating neutrophil-derived chemokine  expression and production does not apply to all situations. For instance, addition of antiTNF-   neutralizing  antibodies  to  the  IFN-   plus  LPS-treated /G61 /G67 PMN indicated that the role of endogenous TNF /G2d/G61 in inducing IP-10 is marginal (12). This is in keeping with the fact that despite the considerable amounts of TNF/G61 released by PMN stimulated with IFN-  plus Y-IgG (23), IP-10 is not expressed /G67 under these conditions  (12).  Furthermore,  we  have  recently

Purified populations of PMN and PBMC isolated from the same donor were cultured with 100 ng/ml LPS or 5 µg/ml OMV for 3 h. Total RNA was then extracted and chemokine mRNA levels assessed by ribonuclease proctection assay using the RiboQuantTM hcK-5 Human Multi-Probe Template Set (PharMingen International, San Diego, CA), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Ten micrograms of total RNA were used for each condition.

observed that PMN respond to stimulation with outer membrane vesicle (OMV) from serogroup B Neisseria meningitidis by producing cytokines such as TNF/G61 , and chemokines such as IL-8 and MIP-1 /G61 and MIP-1 /G62 ( Fig. 1 ), in a manner qualitatively and quantitatively similar to that of LPS-treated cells (J. A. Lapinet-Vera,  P . Scapini,  F. Calzetti,  O. Perez,  M. A.  Cassatella, manuscript submitted). However, anti-TNF /G2d/G61 neutralizing  antibodies  had  no  influence  on  the  capacity  of  OMV  to induce the release of either IL-8 or MIP-1 /G62 (J. A. Lapinet-Vera, P . Scapini,  F. Calzetti,  O. Perez,  M. A.  Cassatella,  manuscript submitted). Although we could not exclude the role of other endogenous  cytokines  produced  in  response  to  OMV  (for example IL-1 /G61 and IL-1 /G62 ), these studies indicate that, in neutrophils, chemokine production can employ stimulus-dependent, distinct pathways.

## Chemokine production by neutrophils in human pathological conditions and in vivo

Even though most of the studies addressing neutrophil-derived chemokines have been conducted in  vitro ,  other  observations support the concept that the release of chemokines constitutes an important function of PMN. For instance, some researchers have used immunohistochemistry, ELISA, in situ hybridization

or reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT -PCR) to document the capacity of neutrophils to produce chemokines in the context of various inflammatory diseases or infections, which  are  classically  characterized  by  a  massive  neutrophil infiltration (summarized in Table 2 ).

These  studies  have  substantially  established  that  neutrophils that have migrated to an inflammatory focus exhibit an altered ability (usually upregulated) to express/produce chemokine(s),  supporting  the  idea  that  neutrophil-derived chemokines  may  contribute  to  the  regulation  of  leukocyte accumulation (reviewed in (19)). Other works, performed in vivo , have provided further evidence that PMN might represent a significant source of chemokines. The majority of the in vivo studies  have  evaluated  the  production  of  neutrophil-derived chemokines in animal models of acute inflammatory responses,  infections  or  reperfusion  after  ischaemia.  Collectively , these works have demonstrated that IL-8, MIP-2 (functionally equivalent to human IL-8), GRO /G61 ,  cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant (CINC)/KC (functionally equivalent to GRO /G61 ), MIP-1 /G61/G2c MIP-1 , MCP-1 (reviewed in (19)) and /G62 IP-10  (A.  Stoppacciaro,  personal  communication)  can  be expressed by neutrophils. In some circumstances, these chemokines  are  expressed  by  neutrophils  at  levels  quantitatively higher than those observed in other cell types (19).

## Final remarks

The  capability  of  PMN  of  producing  several  chemokines,  as well as major pro-inflammatory cytokines, indicates that these cells are important in influencing early cell trafficking and activation during pathophysiological processes. A likely scenario that may occur is that after migration to a focus of infection, PMN  are  stimulated  by  the  aetiological  agent  to  produce chemokines  that  subsequently  serve  an  instrumental  role  in recruiting other leukocyte types cells during the early phases of infection. Indeed, through the production of IL-8, GRO /G61 , MIP1 /G61 ,  MIP-1 /G62 ,  IP-10,  MIG, I-TAC and likely other chemokines ( Fig. 2 ),  neutrophils  can  promote  the  further  recruitment  of neutrophils themselves, as well as the subsequent accumulation and  activation  of  other  granulocyte  types,  monocytes,  macrophages, immature dendritic cells and T -lymphocyte subsets.

A number of studies already support such a scenario. For instance, the role of PMN in the development of the specific immune response against Chlamydophila abortus ( Chlamydia psittaci serotype I) was recently studied in a pregnant mouse model involving treatment with an antineutrophil monoclonal antibody called RB6-8C5 (45). The results suggested that the lack of  neutrophils  in  this  infection  model  led  to  a  substantial decrease in the number of macrophages and T lymphocytes in the  liver,  this  diminution  being  especially  noticeable  in  the

CD8 +  T-cells, which are essential for the resolution of infection (45). A lack of recruitment of macrophages and lymphocytes in other mouse models involving RB6-8C5-induced depletion of PMN had been already described in the case of autoimmune diseases (46) and in response to tumours (47). Furthermore, in a similar model in rats (depleted of PMN using a specific anti-neutrophil monoclonal antibodies designated RP-3), the immunity against transplanted cancer and generation of CD8 + effector T cells to tumour associated antigens were abrogated by  the  selective  neutrophil  depletion  (48,  49).  In  line  with these  observations,  the  same  group  previously  demonstrated that IL-8-induced CD4 +  T -lymphocyte recruitment into subcutaneous  tissues  of  rats  were  inhibited  by  the  RP-3  treament (50).  Finally ,  the  neutrophil  infiltration  of  hapten  challenge sites  during  contact  hypersensitivity  responses  (CHS)  were shown to be essential for the subsequent recruitment of CD8 + T cells and the elicitation of CHS (51). Collectively , these studies suggest that an early neutrophil accumulation may affect the later accumulation of macrophages or T lymphocytes. Although  the  precise  mechanisms  underlying  all  these  phenomena were not elucidated at the molecular level, it can be envisaged that they could be related to the lack of PMN-derived chemokines or other chemotactic factors.

In different immune responses Th lymphocytes differentiate into effector cells that produce different cytokines. The two most distinct polarized populations of Th are the Th1 and Th2 subsets (52). Th1 cells induce phagocyte-dependent immune responses,  exemplified  by  the  delayed-type  hypersensitivity reaction, whereas Th2 cells promote IgE production and eosinophil function, which are key events in the pathogenesis of allergic  inflammation  (52).  Th2  cells  can  also  exert  an  antiinflammatory action by negatively regulating Th1-cell-mediated immunity. Chemokines, other than having an important role in the induction of inflammatory responses, are also likely crucial in selecting the type of immune response (Th1 vs Th2) (53). A variety of chemokine receptors become upregulated upon lymphocyte activation  and  differentiation  into  effector cells, especially those responding to inflammatory chemokines. Many studies have indeed provided evidence that this is the case for CD4 +  T -cell subsets (37, 53), and some studies suggest that there are similar differences in expression of chemokine receptors in functionally distinctive CD8 +  T -cell subsets (Tc1/Tc2) (54).  CCR5  and  CXCR3  are  preferentially  expressed  in  Th1 cells, while CCR3, CCR4, CCR8 and CXCR4 are the chemokine receptors preferentially expressed  in  Th2  cells (55,  56). Accordingly, during bacterial or viral infections, MIP-1 /G61 / , IP/G62 10, MIG and I-TAC (as well as IL-8) production correlates with the  presence  of  Th1  cells  (57).  In  contrast,  during  allergic

inflammatory responses, eotaxin, I-309, macrophage-derived chemokine  and  thymus  and  activation-regulated  chemokine are induced, and the majority of the CD4 +  T lymphocytes are of the Th2-type phenotype (58-60). In this regard, if one considers the chemokines that to date have been shown to be produced (by MIP-1 /G61 , MIP-1 , IP-10, MIG and I-TAC), it immedi/G62 ately  emerges  that  they  represent  the  ligands  for  CCR5  and CXCR3. These observations therefore suggest that neutrophils might contribute selective chemotactic signals that participate in the tissue-specific homing of Th1, in keeping with the frequently  noted  strong  association  of  neutrophils  with  Th1

responses (61). In this context it is worth mentioning that neutrophils  also  produce  IL-12  (62),  a  key  mediator  of  Th1 responses  (63),  and  that  there  is  evidence  that  neutrophilderived IL-12 may play a role in orienting immunity toward the Th1-type response (64, 65). Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that production of chemokines and cytokines by neutrophils influence the development and control of Th1 responses. Whether neutrophils are also able to produce chemokines specific for the heterogeneous population of dendritic cells (at different stages of maturation), or for B cells, is not known yet. Clearly , these are very exciting areas for future study .
