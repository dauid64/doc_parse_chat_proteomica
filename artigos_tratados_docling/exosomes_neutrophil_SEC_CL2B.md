## Abstract

Neutrophils in /uniFB01 ltrate the airways of patients with asthma of all severities, yet their role in the pathogenesis of asthma and their contribution to airway remodeling is largely unknown. We hypothesized that neutrophils modulate airway smooth muscle (ASM) proliferation in asthma by releasing bioactive exosomes. These newly discovered nano-sized vesicles have the capacity to modulate immune responses, cell migration, cell differentiation, and other aspects of cell-to-cell communication. The aim of the study is to determine whether bioactive exosomes are released by neutrophils, and, if so, characterize their proteomic pro /uniFB01 le and evaluate their capacity to modulate ASM cell proliferation. Exosomes were isolated from equine neutrophil supernatants by differential centrifugation and /uniFB01 ltration methods, followed by size-exclusion chromatography. Nanovesicles were characterized using electron microscopy, particle size determination, and proteomic analyses. Exosomes were cocultured with ASM cells and analyzed for exosome internalization by confocal microscopy. ASM proliferation was measured using an impedance-based system. Neutrophils release exosomes that have characteristic size, morphology, and exosomal markers. We identi /uniFB01 ed 271 proteins in

Neutrophils, or polymorphonuclear leukocytes, are the most abundant leukocytes present in the human blood. They play a central role in acute in /uniFB02 ammation, including

the immune response against bacterial and fungal pathogens (1). During the last two decades, new discoveries have underlined the complexity and sophistication of

neutrophil functions (reviewed in Ref. 2). It is now recognized that neutrophils release chemokines, or other cytokines, capable of

proteins that were differentially expressed, which carried proteins associated with immune response and positive regulation of cell communication. Furthermore, neutrophil-derived exosomes were rapidly internalized by ASM cells and altered their proliferative properties. Upon stimulation of LPS, neutrophil-derived exosomes can enhance the proliferation of ASM cells and could therefore play an important role in the progression of asthma and promoting airway remodeling in severe and corticosteroid-insensitive patients with asthma.

## Clinical Relevance

Our /uniFB01 ndings demonstrate a new pathway of intercellular communication mediated by bioactive neutrophil exosomes, underscore their possible contribution to airway remodeling in asthma by modulating airway smooth muscle proliferation, and raise the possibility of immunoregulatory activities in the pathogenesis of an array of other diseases.

regulating the immune/in /uniFB02 ammatory response (3, 4).

Recent studies have reported novel antimicrobial functions of neutrophilsecreted microvesicles (MVs), or ectosomes, arising from plasma membrane budding (5 -8). Neutrophils also release plasma membrane and secretory vesicles (9), and endocytosis could also be involved in an alternative pathway of secretion. In many other cell types, cellular compartments displaying intraluminal membrane-bound vesicles, called multivesicular bodies (8, 10), can fuse with the plasma membrane in an exocytic manner, resulting in the release of nanovesicles called exosomes (11 -16). These nanoparticles are rich in lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids, including microRNAs (miRNAs), noncoding RNA, and mRNA (17). They are able to circulate through tissue and biological /uniFB02 uids, and cross the endothelial barrier to interact with a target cell. Exosomes can stimulate their target cells, induce protein transfers (18), present antigenic peptides (19), and cause epigenetic reprogramming (20). They therefore have the capacity to modulate the host s microenvironment and produce ' conditions that may favor proliferation of neoplastic cell populations (21 -23).

Although the composition of exosomes is dependent on the origin of the tissue or cell type, several proteins related to their biogenesis are common to most exosomes and allow their characterization (exocarta. org/exosome\_markers) (17). Most notable among those proteins are heat shock proteins (HSPs) -27, -70, and -90, signal transduction kinases, members of the endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) complex, adhesion molecules, such as integrins and tetraspanins (CD9 and CD63) (17). Some of these proteins are linked to adhesion and fusion with adjacent cells, cell signaling, and delivery of proteins, mRNAs, and miRNAs. Exosomes have characteristic size (30 -90 nm), shape (on transmission electron microscope), density, and expression of speci /uniFB01 c biomarkers.

Neutrophils in /uniFB01 ltrate the airways of nocturnal, chronic nonatopic, and atopic subjects with asthma, and may be the predominant cells in airway secretions of patients with mild to severe asthma (24). Nevertheless, little is known about the role of neutrophils in the pathogenesis of asthma and of their contribution to lung tissue damage and its repair processes. Asthma is characterized

by air /uniFB02 ow obstruction, primarily due to bronchospasms and remodeling of the airway wall. An increased number of airway myocytes (hyperplasia) contributes to the thickening of the airway smooth muscle (ASM) layer (25, 26). Some studies have suggested that neutrophils and their products might contribute to tissue in /uniFB02 ammation (27) and modulate apoptosis and proliferation of smooth muscle cells (27 -29).

In asthma, the release of potent in /uniFB02 ammatory mediators contributes to respiratory failure (30). It was recently demonstrated that exosomes are released in the lungs, and that they are linked to lung biology and diseases (31, 32), including asthma (33, 34). The implication of exosomes in asthma is further highlighted by the distinct phenotypes and functions of exosomes present in the airways of patients with asthma compared with those of healthy individuals (35). The role of neutrophils in asthmatic airways and their derived extravesicles in the development of airway remodeling in asthmatic airways deserves elucidation. We hypothesized that neutrophils present in asthmatic airways modulate ASM cell proliferation by releasing speci /uniFB01 c bioactive exosomes. First, we demonstrated that neutrophils secrete exosomes, then we characterized the protein content, morphology, and size of these exosomes, and then we evaluated the exosomes ' capacity to enter the ASM cells and modulate their proliferation.

Given the dif /uniFB01 culty of obtaining large humansamplesand, particularly, fresh human blood, the experiments were performed using equine neutrophils. These cells share many similarities with human neutrophils, and they are used to investigate neutrophil-associated respiratory diseases in humans (36 -38). The study also implicates ASM cells isolated from endobronchial biopsies from four different healthy horses.

## Materials and Methods

## Animals

Blood neutrophils were harvested from healthy, adult, mixed-breed mares ( n = 20 for all experiments), from the research herd of the Equine Asthma Research Laboratory at the Universit' de Montr' eal. All e experimental procedures were performed in accordance with the guidelines of the Canadian Council for Animal Care and were approved by the Animal Care

Committee of the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine of the Universit' e de Montr'al. e Horse lungs ( n = 4) were obtained from the slaughterhouse horses within 30 minutes of death and were kept on ice until biopsies could be performed (within a maximal delay of 90 min).

## Cell Culture

Blood neutrophils were isolated from EDTA anticoagulated blood (160 ml/horse) by centrifugation on a density gradient using Ficoll-Paque (Ficoll-PaqueTM PREMIUM 1084; GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences Corp., Mississauga, ON, Canada) according to the manufacturer s instructions. The purity ' and viability of neutrophils were 99.50 ( 6 0.85)% (mean [ 6 SD]) and 97.75 ( 6 0.79)%, respectively ( see the online supplement). Neutrophil apoptosis was also evaluated using allophycocyanin annexin V staining ( see the online supplement). The level of apoptotic activity was less than 25% after 18 hours in culture, and was unaffected by LPS treatment ( see Figure E4 in the online supplement).

ASM cells were isolated from bronchial tissue obtained from horse lungs from the slaughterhouse by enzymatic digestion ( see the online supplement). All experiments with primary ASM (internalization and proliferation experiments) were conducted in triplicate, with three different lung donors.

## Exosome Isolation and Puri /uniFB01 cation

For proteomic analysis, exosomes were prepared from neutrophil supernatants using differential centrifugation and sizeexclusion chromatography (SEC) on Sepharose columns, as previously described (39) (with minor modi /uniFB01 cations). This method allows recovery of vesicles without contamination of proteins and lipoproteins ( see the online supplement).

For in vitro experiments and exosome identi /uniFB01 cations, exosomes were isolated using the centrifugation/ /uniFB01 ltration/ultracentrifugation approach ( see the online supplement).

## Exosome Labeling

Exosomes isolated from neutrophils (centrifugation/ /uniFB01 ltration/ultracentrifugation method) were labeled with the hydrophobic dye PKH67 (MIDI67-1KT; SigmaAldrich, Oakville, ON, Canada) according to a previously described method (40) ( see the online supplement).

## Live Cell and Standard Confocal Microscopy

ASM cells were incubated with PKH67labeled exosomes for 3 hours ( see the online supplement).

## Nano Liquid Chromatography --Tandem Mass Spectrometry

Samples (unstimulated and LPS-stimulated neutrophils derived exosomes) were analyzed by nano -liquid chromatography -tandem mass spectrometry as triplicates for statistical information ( see the online supplement).

## Database Searching and Label-Free Quanti /uniFB01 cation

Spectra were searched against a horse protein database (UniprotKB -taxonomy Equus caballus -27,986 sequences) using the Andromeda module of MaxQuant software v. 1.5.0.25* and Open Source software (41) was used for label-free quanti /uniFB01 cation ( see the online supplement).

## Gene Ontology Enrichment Analysis

Gene ontology enrichment analyses were performed using GoMiner (build 454 [42, 43]), and the BiNGO plugin (v. 3.0.3, PMID [44]) for Cytoscape (v. 3.2.1, PMID [45]) ( see the online supplement).

## Proliferation Assay

ASM proliferation was monitored in real time using the XCELLigence system E-Plate (ACEA, San Diego, CA), a validated method for dynamic, quantitative measurement of cell proliferation (46) that continuously monitors the cellular events, recording label-free changes in electrical impedance (reported as cell index) (47, 48) ( see the online supplement).

## Results

## Neutrophils Secrete Exosomes

Although previous studies have reported that neutrophils secrete MVs ( z 200 nm), we observed, through transmission electron microscope and nanoparticle size analysis, that neutrophils secrete extravesicles ranging from 30 to 400 nm in size (Figure 1). Using ultracentrifugation (100,000 3 g ), small vesicles (Figures 1A -1C, black arrows ) ranging from 30 to 80 nm (expected exosomes), and large membranous vesicles (Figures 1A -1C, white arrows )

ranging from 150 to 400 nm (expected MV) were concentrated. We have not detected particles of greater than 500 nm in any preparation, excluding the vast majority of apoptotic bodies, as components of the samples.

Several different exosome detection methods were combined for this study. Neutrophil-derived exosomes were isolated from cell supernatants through a series of /uniFB01 ltration and centrifugation steps. Exosomes were ef /uniFB01 ciently enriched based on their size (Figures 2B -2D), displaying a bell-shaped curve demonstrating a homogeneous population (Figure 2B). As reported without /uniFB01 xation process (49), we also observed round-shaped vesicles in low levels of /uniFB01 xative (Figure 2D). Exosomes were shown to be 78-kD glucose-regulated protein (endoplasmic reticulum marker)

Microvesicles (MV) and exosomes were next isolated by serial centrifugation/ultracentrifugation steps and analyzed for their shape and size distribution. Using centrifugation (2,000 3 g ) and ultracentrifugation (100,000 3 g ), we observed, by Nanoparticles Size Analysis using the NICOMP 380 device (Pss-USA, NicWard, CO) ( A ) and transmission electron microscope ( B and C ), two different types of vesicles: small vesicles ranging from 30 to 80 nm (expected exosomes) ( A B ; and C black arrows , ) and large, membranous vesicles ( A B ; and C white arrows , ) ranging from 150 to 400 nm (expected MV).

Figure 2. Purification of exosomes from equine neutrophils. Neutrophils (purity, 99.5%) isolated from blood were cultured for 18 hours, and supernatants were harvested. Exosomes were next purified by combined centrifugation/filtration/ultracentrifugation steps and analyzed for their composition (specific markers), shape, and size distribution. ( A ) Purified exosomes from unstimulated or LPS-stimulated neutrophils were analyzed by Western blot using anti-78-kD glucose-regulated protein (GRP78; endoplasmic reticulum marker for isolation purity), and two exosome markers (i.e., anti-tumor susceptibility gene 101 [TSG101] and anti-CD9 antibodies). Exosomes were next analyzed by Nanoparticles Size Analysis using the NICOMP 380 device ( B ) and visualized by electron microscopy ( C ), standard fixative (magnification 3 63,000; high magnification 3 100,000) ( D ), in low fixative concentrations of glutaraldehyde; high magnification, 3 100,000. Purified exosomes show a characteristic lipid bilayer membrane ( arrows ). Scale bars : 100 nm.

## Crude Exosomes Isolated for Proteomic Analysis

Based on a combination of differential centrifugations (low centrifugal force), molecular weight cutoff membranes, and SEC, we developed a strategy for

isolating crude and high-purity exosomes (40 -100 nm in diameter) from unstimulated and LPS-stimulated neutrophils. The SEC is a highly selective separation method providing almost perfect protein purity, and therefore speci /uniFB01 cally used for quantitative proteomic analysis (27 -29). However, its low yield limits its use for in vitro experiments. MVs (mean, 393 nm), mostly in fractions 8 -10 (Figures 3A and 3F), were /uniFB01 rst eluted, whereas exosomes ( z 40 nm) were found in fractions 10 -12 (Figures 3B -3F). Lastly, proteins were eluted after fraction 13. We con /uniFB01 rmed the

exosome-enriched fractions through Western blot analysis, revealing the presence of the exosomal marker, tumor susceptibility gene 101 (Figure 3E).

## Proteome Pro /uniFB01 ling of Exosomes Derived from Neutrophils

A proteomic analysis was performed on 12 exosome preparations ( n =6 horses, 6 from LPS-simulated, and 6 from unstimulatedneutrophil supernatants) using the differential centrifugation and elution SEC approach. Protein identi /uniFB01 cation by tandem mass spectrometry listed 271 unique proteins in neutrophil exosomes (Table E1).

Size distribution of exosomes and MVs in all fractions is performed using the particle sizing systems (NICOMP 380). In fraction 8-10 ( A and F for overlay), MVs were eluted, whereas exosomes ( , 70 nm) were eluted in fractions 10-12 ( B D -and F for overlay). Protein concentrations were measured using a Nano Drop and were eluted after the fraction 13. See F for an overview of all measured results (% of the total number that passed through the column). Each point represents the mean, and the error bars represent the SD from three experiments. Fractions 7-13 were precipitated and analyzed by Western blot ( E ) using anti-TSG101 (exosome markers). As expected, using the particle sizing systems, exosomes were eluted in fractions 10-12. NSA, nanoparticle size analysis.

Among these, 246 were found in exosomes released from unstimulated neutrophils; 191 were found in LPS-stimulated neutrophils, and 166 were identi /uniFB01 ed in the exosomes

from both conditions (Figure 4A). Approximately 72% of the proteins present were also found in Exocarta (17), an updated database reporting all identi /uniFB01 ed exosome

molecules. Consistent with the proposed late-endosome origin of exosomes, several proteins were associated with multivesicular body biogenesis (clathrin heavy chain 1,

heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins, and b -spectrin nonerythrocytic [Table E1]). Furthermore, neutrophil exosomes contained 17 of the 25 proteins identi /uniFB01 ed as exosome markers (Exacarta: GAPDH ACTB, CD63, CD81, ANXA2, ENO1, HSP90AA1, EEF1A1, PKM2, YWHAE, SDCBP, PDCD6IP, ALB, YWHAZ, EEF2, ACTG1, LDHA, HSP90AB1, ALDOA MSN ANXA5 PGK1 CFL1 [17]). We identi /uniFB01 ed proteins that have innate immune roles, implications in metabolism and membrane traf /uniFB01 cking, chaperones, adhesion and cytoskeleton proteins, signaling and immune regulator molecules, and proteins previously associated with asthma remodeling (protein map, Figure 6A). To obtain a functional

overview of the neutrophil exosome proteome, we queried the Gene Ontology database using the BiNGO and GoMiner tools (Table E2, Figures 4B and 4C). As expected, when using the Cellular Component ontology, the exosome proteome shows enrichment of extracellular organelles, vesicles, and exosomes (Figure 4B). When using the Biological Process ontology, we found that the annotation of the exosome proteome is heavily enriched with biological adhesion (cell -cell adhesion, cell -substrate adhesion) and developmental processes. The Molecular Function ontology revealed signi /uniFB01 cant enrichment for binding functions (protein binding, cell adhesion molecule binding,

growth factor binding; Table E2). When combined, these results support the notion that the nano-sized -secreted vesicles in the extracellular medium of neutrophils are exosomes.

The label-free quantitative analysis, based on an MS1 extraction signal by MaxQuant, identi /uniFB01 ed 16 proteins that were differentially expressed between the two conditions (unstimulated neutrophils and neutrophils stimulated by LPS; Table 1). This set of differential proteins displays a clear enrichment for immune response (gene ontology [GO]: 6955, P = 0.007), innate immune response (GO: 45087, P = 0.0011), extrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway (GO: 97191, P = 0.0062), and

positive regulation of signaling (GO: 23056, P = 0.0183) (Figure 4C). This shows that the immune response induced in the neutrophil by LPS directly translates to the content of the secreted exosomes.

## ASM Cellular Uptake of NeutrophilDerived Exosomes

Fluorescent immunocytochemistry and /uniFB02 ow cytometry were used to con /uniFB01 rm that near-con /uniFB02 uent ASM cells stained ( . 95%) for smooth muscle -speci /uniFB01 c a -actin ( . 70%) desmin, and smooth muscle myosin heavy chain ( . 75%) (supplementary data Table E3). ASM cells were incubated in the presence of neutrophil-derived exosomes labeled with PKH67 ( green ) for 3 hours (Figure 5). Exosomes were internalized by ASM cells and moved toward the perinuclear region (Figure 5A). To demonstrate that the uptake of neutrophil exosomes could modulate ASM proliferation, we adopted a label-free system, which measured the impedance of the cell monolayer in real time without altering or disturbing the cell culture (Figure 5B). ASM cells adhered and proliferated in the presence of complete medium until reaching a preestablished cell index value, settled in the range from 2.5 to 3. Subsequently (at the 22-h point), when the two exosome preparations (i.e., from unstimulated neutrophils and LPS-stimulated neutrophils [or residual LPS in media and PBS as controls] were added), the cell index was recorded for up to 24 hours after their addition. Analysis was performed after normalization, and we observed that the ratio of stimulated neutrophil -derived exosomes condition signi /uniFB01 cantly increased the rate of ASM cell growth ( P = 0.020) compared with that of the unstimulated condition and residual LPS ( P = 0.019) (Figure 5B). To exclude the possibility that this effect resulted from contaminating LPS on exosomes, we /uniFB01 nally incubated ASM with LPS and found that it did not alter proliferation (Figure 5C).

## Discussion

This study investigated the presence and nature of nano-sized vesicles secreted by neutrophils. Electron microscopy, particle size analysis, and proteomic data demonstrated that, spontaneously and upon LPSstimulation, neutrophils release exosomes

The impedance value of each well was automatically monitored every 15 minutes for a duration of 50 hours and expressed as a cell index (CI) value. All data were analyzed using the xCELLigence software (version 1.2.1) and expressed as mean of CI normalized to the last CI recorded before the time of cell treatment (addition of exosomes).

( A ) The neutrophil-derived exosome is composed of various proteins involved in targeting and adhesion (e.g., integrins and tetraspanins), membrane trafficking (e.g., annexins and RAP1A), signal transduction molecules (e.g., syntenin and YWHAH), immunoregulator proteins (galectin 9), metabolism proteins (e.g., enolase and LCAT), cytoskeleton proteins (ex. fibronectin, tubulin), chaperone proteins (e.g., heat shock protein [HSP] -90 and HSP70), transcription regulation proteins (e.g., EEF2 and EEF1A1), MVB formation proteins (Tsg101 and clathrin heavy chain 1) and growth factor (transforming growth factor [TGF] BI). Interestingly, exosomes also contain asthma remodeling-related proteins (e.g., MMP9, LTA4H, SERPINH1, and COL1A1).

Exosomes are specialized nanovesicles known to play important roles in

intercellular communication. They encapsulate proteins and other molecules, protecting them from enzymatic degradation in the extracellular compartment. Exosomes rapidly reach distant cells, and their surface markers allow their internalization by the recipient

cells, a mechanism by which the exosome affect the behavior of these cells. Microscopy analysis performed for this study revealed that neutrophil exosomes are rapidly observed within the cytoplasm of ASM cells. Previous reports demonstrated that exosome internalization

Protein with significant abundance change ( . twofold change, P , 0.05 on three replicate measurements) between unstimulated and LPS-stimulated neutrophil exosomes.

in ovarian, endothelial, or dendritic cells (8, 9, 50) occurs through endocytosis. Our observations show that neutrophil exosomes were routed toward the nuclear region of ASM cells, but did not enter the nucleus. These /uniFB01 ndings suggest that exosomes were /uniFB01 rst trapped in vesicles, transported to the perinuclear region, and were then likely grouped into large organelles, a mechanism previously described (51, 52). Due to the /uniFB02 uorescence persisting for at least 5 hours around the perinuclear region appearing as punctuate signals, we speculate that some exosomes were fused with other vesicles and carried on their function, whereas others may have followed the lipid s exosome ' recycling pathway, as reported by Tian and colleagues (52; reviewed in Ref. 53). However, of note, the methodology we used for uptake visualization (i.e., PKH67 labeling followed by a concentration and aggregates generation) has the advantage of viewing by confocal microscopy (54), but could have modi /uniFB01 ed their mode of entry (privileged internalization) into the cells.

Exosomes emerge as active components of paracrine secretion (55, 56). To understand the potential biological mechanism by which

neutrophil exosomes enhance ASM proliferation, we undertook a proteomic analysis of the unstimulated/LPS neutrophil exosomes. We adopted an SEC method to dissociate exosomes from other vesicles (i.e., MVs) and proteins known to aggregate and sediment at the high centrifugal force ( z 100,000 3 g ) used for the /uniFB01 rst isolation step (57 -59). The Orbitrap Fusion mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scienti /uniFB01 c, Burlington, ON, Canada) we used allows quantitative accuracy, sensitivity, and excellent protein identi /uniFB01 cation. Our proteomic analysis revealed the presence of exosomal markers and proteins commonly found in vesicles, some having innate immune roles, others being involved in metabolism and membrane traf /uniFB01 cking, growth factors, chaperones, cytoskeleton, and signal transduction (Figure 6). Many of these proteins have been shown to be crucial for communication with various and distant cells (60, 61). Interestingly, we also identi /uniFB01 ed proteins previously associated with asthma remodeling, including proteases and inhibitors of in /uniFB02 ammation and remodeling (matrix metallopeptidase 9 [MMP9] and a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with

thrombospondin-1 motifs [13th member of the family] [ADAMTS13]), remodeling molecules (tenascin C [TNC], lectin, galactoside-binding, soluble, 9B [LGALS9B], and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 3 [VEGFR3]), asthma susceptibility markers leukotriene A4 hydrolase (LTA4H), transforming growth factor (TGF)b superfamily members in airway in /uniFB02 ammation and remodeling (TGFBI), and extracellular matrix -associated proteins (collagen [COL]6A3, COL12A1, COL9A1, COL6A1, COL2A1, and COL1A2). We also identi /uniFB01 ed that exosomes carried surface adhesion molecules (CD44, CD90, CD9, neural cell adhesion molecule [NCAM], integrin b 1 [ITGB1], and ITGB2) involved in recognition and cell adhesion (36, 37, 46, 48), and suggested to be involved in exosome uptake (51). We found heparan sulfate proteoglycans possibly serving as the receptors of neutrophil exosomes for their internalization and functional activity as found by Christianson and colleagues (62) in cancer cells. These /uniFB01 ndings suggest that neutrophil exosomes could enter the cells by a mechanism used by viruses (62). The majority of proteins were identi /uniFB01 ed in both unstimulated and stimulated conditions, demonstrating the constant composition of exosomes. However, the proteomic composition varied after LPS stimulation, suggesting that exosomes may modulate biological process, as we observed for ASM proliferation. For instance, thrombospondin1, serpin peptidase inhibitor, clade B, member 6, S100A9, and neutrophil gelatinase -associated lipocalin are differentially regulated by LPS, and may contribute to enhanced cell proliferation. Thrombospondin-1 is a matricellular glycoprotein involved in in /uniFB02 ammation and angiogenesis (63); it is strongly expressed in neutrophils (64) and in exosomes of LPS-stimulated neutrophils, and promotes ASM proliferation in vascular smooth muscle (65). serpin peptidase inhibitor, clade B, member 6, a clade B serpin implicated in the activity of serine proteases involved in several processes, such as in /uniFB02 ammation, apoptosis, and tumorigenesis (66 -68), and found at high levels in the cytoplasm of neutrophils (69), was down-regulated in exosomes from LPS-stimulated neutrophils. Lastly, S100A9 could have contributed to the

enhanced ASM proliferation we observed, as it was recently suggested that this protein plays a role in tumor cell growth (7). Conversely, neutrophil gelatinase -associated lipocalin, a component of neutrophil granules, reported to induce apoptosis, and integrinb 2, a powerful moderator of life or death decisions, were reduced in exosomes released after LPS stimulation (70, 71). Further investigations are therefore required to determine the biological mechanisms by which ASM cell proliferation was promoted and the exact roles played by these factors. Furthermore, exosomes also carry mRNA and miRNA that could be transferred into recipient cells (20) and increase ASM proliferation. Thus, we postulate that exosomes released by neutrophils interact actively with ASM cells through their proteomic background after being internalized by ASM cells, dumping their nucleic acid content into the cell. This hypothesis could constitute an indirect mechanism in the modulation of the ASM cells in asthma and other airway diseases.

We also con /uniFB01 rmed the release of MVs by neutrophils and the necessity of implementing sequential puri /uniFB01 cation steps to obtain high purity in each of these nanovesicles (exosomes). This /uniFB01 nding leads us to believe that content and biological activity attributed to

neutrophil ectosomes or MVs in some earlier studies may be due to the presence of contaminating exosomes. There is still a lack of standardization for extravesicle isolation protocols, and several studies working on ectosomes applied a high centrifugal acceleration (100,000 3 g or 200,000 3 g ), thereby isolating vesicles larger and smaller than 100 nm. The isolation method used in this study combined an initial /uniFB01 ltration, multiple sequential centrifugation steps (removing the pellet and increasing the centrifugal force), and an SEC approach (for proteomic analysis), allowing us to separate exosomes from other vesicles with different sizes and density.

This study aimed at elucidating a possible role of neutrophil exosomes in the pathogenesis of asthma through their contribution to airway remodeling. We studied equine neutrophils, as exosome isolation for our experiments required up to 3 3 10 8 highly puri /uniFB01 ed neutrophils per condition, and, due to their large size, these animals were ideal for collecting larger volumes of blood. Horses also spontaneously develop heaves, an asthma-like condition sharing marked similarities with human neutrophilic asthma (72), including remodeling of the ASM layer (73) and extracellular matrix (74). Lastly, access to lung tissues from a local slaughterhouse allowed for the isolation of smooth muscle cells from

In conclusion, by studying the release and roles of neutrophil exosomes, we showed that activated neutrophils release exosomes that interact with ASM cells and alter their proliferative properties. This suggests that neutrophils could contribute to airway remodeling in asthma (Figure 6). We also identi /uniFB01 ed several neutrophil exosome -enclosed proteins, possibly involved in the proliferative effect of LPS-stimulated neutrophils. Using bioinformatics analyses, we showed that the immune response, /uniFB01 broblast proliferation, and positive regulation of signal transduction GO terms (Figure 4C) are speci /uniFB01 cally enriched in the stimulated exosomes. These /uniFB01 ndings corroborate the popular hypothesis that neutrophils and their products, here identi /uniFB01 ed as exosomes, contribute to tissue in /uniFB02 ammation, and modulate apoptosis and proliferation of smooth muscle cells. n
