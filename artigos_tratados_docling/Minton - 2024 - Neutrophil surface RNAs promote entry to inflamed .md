## Neutrophil surface RNAs promote entry to inflamed sites

Two recent studies have detected RNAs on the surface of live cells, some of which are N-glycosylated (glycoRNAs), but the in vivo functions of these RNAs are unknown. Zhang et al. now show that in the case of neutrophils, these cell-surface glycoRNAs promote the recruitment of cells to sites of inflammation, involving adhesion to endothelial cells mediated by P-selectin.

Using purified primary neutrophils and differentiated neutrophils from a progenitor cell line, the authors detected glycosylation of cellular RNA and showed the presence of these glycoRNAs on the surface of live cells using extracellular RNase A (exRNaseA)mediated digestion and by labelling with a nucleoside homologue.

In mouse models of acute peritonitis and acute lung inflammation, neutrophils pre-treated with exRNaseA before transfer into the circulation were markedly reduced in number at the sites of inflammation compared with non-treated neutrophils, despite having similar levels in peripheral blood, spleen and bone marrow and similar viability.

Thus, cell-surface RNAs seem to be required for neutrophil recruitment. Indeed, cell-surface RNAs were shown in vitro to promote the adhesion of neutrophils to endothelial cells, and this could be blocked by pre-treating endothelial cells with the glycan fraction but not the RNA fraction of neutrophil-derived glycoRNAs. Intravital imaging of neutrophil-  endothelial cell interactions also showed a role for

cell-surface RNAs in regulating the initial capture and rolling of neutrophils in the circulation on blood-vessel endothelial cells.

Further studies showed that neutrophil glycoRNAs are recognized by P-selectin, which is an inflammation-induced receptor on endothelial cells for the glycoprotein PSGL1. Endothelial cells pre-treated with a blocking antibody to P-selectin had markedly reduced binding of glycoRNAs in vitro, and treating live neutrophils with exRNaseA reduced binding to a P-selectin-Fc fusion protein without affecting levels of PSGL1. Knockout of P-selectin in endothelial cells markedly reduced adhesion to neutrophils and this was not further reduced by exRNaseA, which shows that glycoRNAs are an important source of P-selectin ligands.

Zhang et al. showed that cell-surface glycoRNAs are mainly small RNAs produced in a cell-autonomous manner, rather than being captured from other cells. This process requires the RNA transporter genes Sidt1 and Sidt2 . In the acute peritonitis model, Sidt -knockdown neutrophils were reduced in number in the inflamed peritoneum compared with wild-type neutrophils.

## 'glycans of neutrophil cell-surface glycoRNAs bind P-selectin to mediate endothelial cell adhesion'

In summary, this study shows that glycans of neutrophil cell-surface glycoRNAs bind P-selectin to mediate endothelial cell adhesion and migration to inflammatory sites. The data do not suggest that P-selectin is the only receptor for glycoRNAs or that the effects of glycoRNAs on neutrophil recruitment are mediated solely by endothelial cell adhesion, leaving open the possibility that cell-surface glycoRNAs have other undiscovered biological functions.
