## THERAPEUTICS TARGETING THE INNATE IMMUNE SYSTEM

## Richard J. Ulevitch

Proteins that recognize the components and products of microorganisms have an important role in innate immunity. Here, I focus on recent advances in our understanding of the function of several such protein families. In particular, I consider how members of the TLR (T oll-like receptor), NOD (nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain)-protein and MyD88 (myeloid differentiation primaryresponse protein 88) families are providing emerging opportunities for the development of new therapeutics that modify innate immune responses in ways which benefit the host.

The modulation of immune responses - achieved by targeting cell-surface receptors or intracellular pathways - is one of the main goals in the development of new therapeutics for human immune or inflammatory diseases. Traditionally, the focus has been on targets that are considered to be part of the adaptive immune system. In this way, major efforts have been made to develop therapeutics for transplantation, autoimmunity and cancer. Now, the ever-expanding wealth of information about the innate immune system, including the identification of cognate ligands of innate immune receptors and the elucidation of their downstream signalling pathways, provides a new set of targets for drug development, which might impact on various human diseases 1-9 . The innate immune system sits at the intersection  of the  pathways  of microbial  recognition, inflammation, microbial  clearance  and  cell  death, thereby offering diverse targets for therapeutics (FIG.1). This review limits its scope to gene families that encode the key receptors of the innate immune system - the Toll-like  receptor  ( TLR )-  and  nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain ( NOD )-gene families - their ligands and their downstream signalling pathways. Here, the term ligand is used to indicate a molecule that binds to its cognate receptor, although for TLRs and NOD  proteins  proof of the  formation  of a ligand-receptor complex is often lacking. TLRs comprise a family of cell-surface and endosomally expressed receptors that recognize conserved products unique to microorganisms, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS),

leading to the activation of the innate and adaptive immune systems. The proteins that are encoded by the NOD genes (also known as members of the caterpillar family) are cytosolic proteins that have a role in various innate and adaptive immune responses. Of particular interest here are NOD1 and NOD2, which recognize distinct structures derived from peptidoglycan that are not ligands for TLRs 10-12 .

In  mammals, the  main  function  of the  innate immune system is to detect the presence of invading microorganisms. Importantly, another concept of the function of innate immunity is emerging - that it also has a role in sterile inflammation. Sterile inflammation is not driven by the response to infection with microorganisms but by ligands derived from damaged cells, which are not usually present in the extracellular environment: for example, heat-shock proteins, β -defensins and oxidized lipids. It can also be speculated that proteins modified by oxidation or nitration might be TLR ligands and thereby might promote sterile inflammation. So, in both infection and sterile inflammation, the innate immune system uses receptors that include members of the TLR and NOD-protein families 9 . Ligands for these receptor families can be divided into several groups: naturally occurring molecules that are released from microbial sources, synthetic structures based on those of microbial products, small molecules with no obvious structural relationships to naturally occurring ligands and endogenous ligands of host origin. The downstream signalling pathways for the TLRs

Figure 1 | Innate immunity at the crossroads. The innate immune system is at the intersection of several pathways that influence the balance between health and disease. These pathways, which are responsible for the recognition of microorganisms and endogenous host-derived ligands, trigger the clearance and/or killing of microorganisms, as well as apoptotic and necrotic cell-death pathways that depend on pro-inflammatory mediators.

and NOD proteins show one main difference. TLRs couple ligand binding to cell activation through members of the myeloid differentiation primary-response protein 88 (MyD88)-adaptor family (BOX 1), whereas NOD proteins do not seem to use MyD88-dependent signal-transduction pathways. In the signalling that occurs in an innate immune response, two central events are the activation of nuclear factorκ B (NFκ B) and interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) . The NFκ B pathway controls the production of pro-inflammatory molecules, such as interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumournecrosis factor (TNF), whereas the IRF3 pathway leads to the production of type I interferons (IFNα and IFNβ ). In this review, I discuss interesting drug targets that have emerged from recent studies of TLRs and/or NOD proteins, without considering as targets the numerous downstream cytokines and other mediators that are produced following the activation of the innate immune system.

Signalling from TLRs involves the T oll/IL-1 receptor (TIR) domain of the receptor interacting with one or more members of the MyD88-adaptor family, which also each contain a TIR domain. These interactions are known as TIR-TIR domain interactions 4,13-15 . The engagement of a TLR by its cognate ligand most probably facilitates the formation of a hetero- or homodimeric receptor, which then interacts with cytosolic TIR-domain-containing adaptor proteins. Numerous studies have investigated the signalling pathways  immediately  downstream  of the  TIRdomain interactions, showing how the molecules IRAK1 (IL-1 receptor (IL-1R)-associated kinase 1), IRAK4 and TRAF6 (TNF-receptor-associated factor 6)

are involved; however, here, only the steps that include the MyD88-adaptor family are considered.Ultimately,we need to define the signalling events and gene-activation patterns that occur downstream of each of the TLRs so that we can identify appropriate targets for the selective activation or inhibition of these pathways.

In contrast to the TLRs, NOD1 and NOD2 seem to signal  through  pathways  that  are  independent  of members of the MyD88 family. Instead, after engagement of their cognate ligands, NOD proteins activate NFκ B through a pathway that requires the kinase RICK(receptor-interacting serine/threonine kinase; also known as receptor-interacting protein 2, RIP2) 16,17 . RICK and NOD1 or NOD2 interact through the caspase-recruitment domains (CARDs) present in each protein. Further details about other proteins involved in NOD-protein signalling are unknown at present.

The central question then is how to use the current information about the signalling pathways of the innate immune system to design new therapeutics. The desired feature of any therapeutic that modifies the innate immune response - either as an agonist or antagonist - is, of course, specificity. In this review, examples of agonists and antagonists are provided to illustrate the potential utility of drugs targeting innate immunity. Complications that could arise from either blocking or activating innate immunity are also discussed, as well as issues that result from targeting innate immune pathways in acute and chronic settings.

## TLR family

Over the past five years, there have been remarkable advances in the identification and characterization of the TLRs. This information provides the basis for considering  new  ways  of modulating the innate immune response by designing new therapeutic approaches (FIG. 2).

The Drosophila studies of Hoffmann and colleagues 18-21 provided  the  basis  for  the  discovery of the TLRs, the mammalian homologues of the Drosophila protein Toll. The TLR family now consists of 13 members: although only TLR1 to TLR10 have been identified in humans. TLR11 does not seem to be present in humans 22 , and TLR10 is not present in mice. TLRs are members of the Toll/IL-1R (TIR)domain-containing superfamily, and there is considerable homology between the cytoplasmic domains of all family members. In particular, a high degree of similarity exists within the 200 amino-acid region that comprises the TIR domain; within this domain are up to three conserved regions that are crucial for the assembly of downstream signalling complexes containing one or more members of the MyD88adaptor family. Other proteins that transduce signals or otherwise regulate receptor function probably also form part of these complexes. Despite the similarity of TIR-domain-containing superfamily members, there are substantial differences in the extracellular regions of these proteins. The extracellular regions of the IL-1Rs consist of immunoglobulin-like domains. By contrast, the TLRs have two highly conserved

structural features, the most important of which is the leucine-rich repeat (LRR)-containing ectodomain. This domain is thought to be involved in ligand recognition and usually comprises 24-29 amino-acid repeats that contain the canonical repeat XLXXLXLXX, where X denotes any amino acid. Both the LRRs and the TIR domains could be exploited as drug targets.

In addition to the conserved structural features among the TLRs, there seems to be another level of organization. The TLRs that are involved in the recognition of microbial products - TLR1,TLR2,TLR4,TLR5, TLR6and TLR11 - are displayed on the cell surface. By contrast, TLR7, TLR8 and TLR9 are localized intracellularly, and their natural ligands might only be found within acidic compartments, such as phagolysosomes. The natural ligand for TLR9 is bacterial DNA, and recent studies using TLR7-deficient mice, as well as investigations of human TLR8, have shown that these TLRs recognize guanosine and uridine (G+U)-rich single-stranded RNA.Whether TLR3 functions at the cell surface or intracellularly is still unresolved, although some reports indicate that signalling from TLR3 does require endosomal maturation 23 . These differences between TLRs indicate that the design of synthetic agonists will need to take cellular localization into consideration. For example, if high-throughput binding assays are to be used to identify novel TLR ligands, then the pH of the binding solutions will need to reflect the potential differences between the plasma membrane and intracellular compartments. The precise mechanism by which synthetic ligands enter cells and engage

MAL),TRIF(TIR-domain-

containing adaptor protein inducing interferonβ ), TRAM(TRIF-related adaptor molecule) and SARM (sterile α - and armadillo-motif-containing protein) 15 . Evidence from genetic and biochemical studies has linked signalling from Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7),TLR8 and TLR9 to a pathway that requires only MyD88.By contrast,signalling from TLR2,after the formation of a heterodimer with either TLR1 or TLR6,is linked to a pathway that requires a complex of MyD88 and a second adaptor,TIRAP .The activation of interferon-regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and the subsequent induction of interferonβ, which are elicited by signalling from TLR3 or TLR4,are MyD88-independent and involve a third adaptor, TRIF.A fourth adaptor, TRAM,is also involved in MyD88-independent signalling through TLR4 (REF.74-77) , and a fifth adaptor, SARM, has been described, but its role in TLR signalling is unclear at present.At the most proximal step after ligand binding,these proteins of the MyD88-adaptor family provide specificity for the outcome of TLR signalling that is initiated following the engagement of different types of ligands by different TLRs.

their cognate intracellular TLRs also remains to be determined. This is of particular interest for the synthetic TLR9 ligand, which is based on non-methylated CpG sequences that are found in bacterial DNA.

The report by Medzhitov, Janeway and PrestonHurlburt 98 that  described  a  human  homologue  of Drosophila Toll showed that the expression of human Toll (TLR) in human cell lines leads to the activation of NF- B and the expression of cytokines. This data led to κ the first model for TLR-dependent cell activation, in which the expression and multimerization of TLRs is sufficient to support cell activation. Subsequently, when the cognate ligands for the TLRs were defined, it became clear that TLRs associate with other proteins to form a heteromeric receptor complex.These additional proteins might be TLRs that form either homo- or heterodimeric complexes or proteins unrelated to the TLR family. There are several examples of each type of receptor complex, including the CD14-MD2-TLR4 complex 24,25 and the TLR2-TLR1 (REFS 26-29), TLR2-TLR6 (REFS 26-29) and TLR4-TLR5 (REF. 30) complexes. Although heteromeric complexes have only been identified for TLRs that are present at the plasma membrane, it seems probable that further components of these complexes will be identified for both the cell-surface expressed and intracellular TLRs.

There is little doubt that the heteromeric nature of the TLR complexes reflects the downstream physiological pathways.So,can this knowledge be exploited to identify new drug targets that do not require the development of novel agonists or antagonists that directly target the TLR-ligand-binding sites? To achieve this, agents that disrupt protein-protein interactions will be required.

## NOD-protein family

Recently, a family of mammalian proteins that contain a nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD) and LRRs has been shown to have an important role in innate immunity, and substantial progress has been made in identifying the ligands for the two family members that have known innate immune functions: NOD1 and NOD2 (REFS 10-12) (FIG.3). Members of this family also have structural features that are found in the large family of R proteins (also known as plant disease-resistance proteins) 31-33 . There are more than 20 members of the NOD-protein family, including proteins of known and unknown functions. One common feature of these proteins is the presence of specific structural  domains  at  the  amino  (N)-terminus, including the CARD and pyrin sequences. The latter allow for unique protein-protein interactions and most probably, the propagation of some downstream signals. The tissue-distribution patterns of NOD proteins  range  from  ubiquitous  to  highly  restricted. Mutations in several proteins - including NOD2, MHC class II transactivator (CIITA), neuronal apoptosis inhibitory protein 5 (NAIP5) and cryopyrin are associated with increased disease susceptibilities, chronic inflammatory disease and hypersensitivity to some bacterial infections. The NOD-protein family initiates cellular activation through a multi-protein

complex known as an inflammasome. The composition and properties of these multi-protein complexes are discussed in detail by Martinon and Tschopp 34 and are not reviewed here. NOD-protein-family members seem to be involved in a number of autoinflammatory human diseases, such as Blau syndrome, Muckle-Wells syndrome and familial cold urticaria, thereby indicating their importance in inflammation. This probably also depends, in part, on members of the inflammatorycaspase family. The blockade of caspases by selective inhibitors is a well-developed research area and is not discussed further here.

Figure 2 | TLRs as targets for therapy. Toll-like receptor (TLR) signalling is initiated by plasma membrane and intracellular (endosomal) TLRs following ligand recognition. TLR4 is shown as a representative membrane receptor and the endosomal TLRs (TLR7, TLR8 and TLR9) are also shown. Stimulation of TLRs triggers interaction with the adaptor molecule MyD88 (myeloid differentiation primary-response protein 88). Other adaptor molecules, TIRAP (Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR)-domain-containing adaptor protein), TRIF (TIR-domain-containing adaptor molecule inducing interferonβ ) and TRAM (TRIF-related adaptor molecule)  are also involved in TLR4 signalling. The MyD88-dependent signalling pathway leads to the activation of nuclear factorκ B (NFκ B), which regulates the expression of target genes that encode pro-inflammatory mediators. Several laboratories have developed agonists of TLR4 and the endosomal TLRs that can stimulate TLR signalling and should be useful therapeutics for treating various human diseases. The key steps that could be targeted in the development of molecules to inhibit TLR signalling are also indicated.

Two of the NOD-protein-family members, NOD1 and NOD2, are intracellular sensors for bacterial products that include subunit structures found in bacterial peptidoglycans 10-12 . Similar to the TLRs, the LRR domains of NOD1 and NOD2 are thought to contain the ligand-binding sites. The N-terminal domains might also provide additional sites for drug interactions. A  recent  study  by  Nunez  and  colleagues 35 highlights the complexity of the domains of NOD1 and NOD2 that are required for ligand binding. The fact that NOD1 and NOD2 recognize ligands derived from bacterial peptidoglycan, are linked to NFκ B and contain CARDs indicates that these proteins  are  involved  in  pathways  that  regulate inflammation and cell death. The cell-death pathways are almost certainly mediated by members of the caspase family, including those known as inflammatory caspases 34 .

## TLR and NOD-protein ligands

There are at least four broad types of ligand for the TLRs, and for NOD1 and NOD2: naturally occurring molecules that are constituents of microorganisms, synthetic analogues of naturally occurring substances, small-molecule  fully  synthetic  compounds, and endogenous components that are released from host cells during processes such as necrosis, apoptosis and inflammation.Ligands are generally thought of as agonists, but several classes of antagonist have been developed using the structure of agonists as a template for synthetic analogues. A survey of TLR ligands is shown in TABLE 1. Most of the ligands are derived from microbial sources, and they include polymeric molecules such as peptidoglycans (which bind TLR2), bacterial LPS (TLR4), bacterial and viral DNA (TLR9) 36,37 and double-stranded RNA (TLR3). Nonetheless, there are many naturally occurring ligands, these are small molecules and include lipoteichoic acid (TLR2), lipoarabinomannan (TLR2) and taxol (TLR4). Large polymeric molecules are not ideal drug candidates because of many factors, including their pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic  properties. By  contrast, because small-molecule ligands have been identified for many of the TLRs, the design of new small molecules with drug-like properties seems to be within reach. There are already good examples of synthetic analogues of naturally occurring ligands, such as molecules based on the structure of lipid A, CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) modelled on bacterial DNA sequences, peptidoglycan subunits containing muramic acid, and unique peptide sequences 38 . Compounds of the imidazole quinoline series, which function as immunostimulants, provide proof-of-concept that fully synthetic small molecules are recognized by TLRs.

The ligands for NOD1 and NOD2 are distinct and the minimal structural requirements have been defined. Both are derived from bacterial peptidoglycan: NOD2 recognizes ligands with muramyl-dipeptidic structures, whereas  NOD1 binds to tripeptide  structures  in which the terminal amino acid is diaminopimelic acid. Interestingly, the binding of tripeptides to NOD1

does not require the presence of a muramic acid backbone. Neither NOD1 nor NOD2 seem to recognize polymeric peptidoglycan structures, regardless of the bacterial source.

## Targeting innate immunity in human disease

Targeting the innate immune system could provide therapeutic benefit in both acute and chronic human diseases. Efforts are also being directed towards using TLR ligands in vaccines. Examples of each of these applications are discussed here.

Asthma. Considerable effort is going into the design of new approaches to treat asthma. The prevalence of allergic  diseases, including  asthma, has  increased markedly in the past three decades. Unfortunately, there are few new drugs that offer cures for these problems, or even provide control or treatment. We still rely on glucocorticoids and bronchodilators, used in combination and in various forms of administration, as the standard practice. Although they are effective, these drugs need to be administered at least twice daily and are not without long-term effects, especially in the increasingly young patient population. Furthermore, corticosteroids that block inflammatory cells do not

alter the prevailing T helper 2 (T H2)-cell-type response in sensitized individuals. Therefore, longer-lasting treatments  afforded  by  manipulating  the  innate immune  system  would  provide  a  great  advance. Immunotherapy can result in decreased symptoms, reduced medication use and enhanced quality of life. It can also prevent the transition from allergic disease to asthma. So, immunotherapy might have therapeutic as well as preventive effects. However, the present design of treatments is limited by our lack of understanding of the essential mechanisms that are involved in triggering chronic inflammatory disease. For example, in asthma, we do not have a mechanistic explanation for the selective activation of T H2 cells 39-41 . Nonetheless, it is clear that one aim of treating asthma with immunomodulators would be to try to change the T H -cell balance in asthmatic individuals: that is, from the dominant T H2-type inflammation to a T H1-type response. Central to this approach is the use of synthetic TLR ligands. In particular, there has been a sustained effort to use oligonucleotides that contain non-methylated CpG motifs to shift the balance to a T H1-type response 40 . This strategy stems from the 'hygiene hypothesis' , which states that the marked reduction in infection in children in modern society produces decreased T H1-type responses and concomitant T H2-type inflammation. Approaches to treat patients using T H1-type cytokines have failed and, in some cases, have caused serious side effects. There are numerous preclinical studies showing that administration of the TLR9 ligand CpG ODN induces the production of T H1-type cytokines, blocks the production of T H2 cytokines and prevents the symptoms of asthma. Treatment with CpG ODNs seems to reduce disease, without the serious side effects produced following the administration of T H1-type cytokines. However, at present, there is too little attention paid to the potential side effects of chronic administration of immunostimulatory molecules; potential drawbacks of this type of therapy are discussed later.

Adjuvants/immunostimulation. Another  area  that could  benefit  from  targeting  the  innate  immune response is the development of new adjuvants for vaccines.Vaccines are crucial for the management and prevention of infectious disease. Although our endogenous defences mount effective responses to microorganisms, it seems that enhanced innate immunity could be beneficial in specific settings. Previously, such enhancement of immune responses has been achieved using complex mixtures of microbial products, which most probably function through the innate immune system to enhance adaptive immune responses 42,43 . In addition, we now know that several types of TLR ligand are efficacious as vaccine adjuvants 44,45 . This has been demonstrated for synthetic TLR7 agonists (imiquimod and resiquimod), TLR9 agonists (CpG ODNs) and TLR4 agonists (lipid A analogues), thereby indicating the merits of identifying synthetic TLR agonists. Here, I discuss a few important examples that involve TLR4, TLR7 and TLR9 (TABLE 2). There are now considerable data indicating that the use of synthetic TLR4 agonists can be beneficial. Some of

the most compelling data have been obtained using monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL) 46-48 . This compound is a chemically modified derivative of the lipid A moiety of LPS. MPL is considerably less toxic than LPS but has a similar immunostimulatory activity. MPL has been used extensively in clinical trials, in formulations of both prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines that have targeted various diseases, including cancer, infectious disease and allergies. It seems to have a strong safety profile and good efficacy. A set of related compounds that are also lipid A mimetics, aminoalkylglucosaminide 4-phosphates (AGPs), have been found to be TLR4 ligands and some molecules from this new group of immunostimulants will undoubtedly move into clinical trials. In particular, one derivative, RC-529, has been used in a hepatitis B vaccine trial, replacing the standard alum-based adjuvant. In nearly all of those vaccinated with an MPL adjuvant, protective antibody levels were reached after only two doses of the vaccine, in contrast to  the  current  protocol  in  which  three  doses  are required to obtain similar levels of protection.

Recently, single-stranded RNA has been shown to be a ligand for mouse TLR7 and human TLR8 (REFS 49,50). However, it is well known that several small-molecule immunostimulants are also ligands for TLR7 and TLR8. The  prototypical  compound, resiquimod, induces IFNα and other cytokines. Resiquimod is one of a class of imidazole quinolines and has been the subject of several clinical investigations. It has been shown to be an immune-response modifier that enhances cutaneous immune responses: it is effective against  external  genital  warts  and  other  diseases

caused by human papillomavirus 51,53 . The imidazole quinolines are the first class of TLR agonists to be used for several clinical applications in humans. Another compound, loxoribine (7-allyl-7,8-dihydro8-oxo-guanosine), has antitumour activity and functions through a TLR7- MyD88-dependent pathway, which was demonstrated using TLR7- and MyD88deficient mice as a source of cells 54-56 . The activity of loxoribine and resiquimod depend on endosomal maturation and presumably acidification. In this regard, TLR7 and TLR8 are similar to TLR9 and seem to form a subgroup within the TLR family, which functions in endosomal/lysosomal compartments. TLR7  also  recognizes  bropirimine, an  immunostimulant known to have antitumour effects in superficial  transitional-cell  carcinoma  of the  bladder. Bropirimine might have direct effects on tumour cells rather than functioning through inducible mediators; however, more study is required to understand its mechanism of action.

Infection. Last, one might consider targeting innate immune pathways in the acute setting, where there is local or systemic infection. Here, blunting the proinflammatory cascade might be achieved using receptor  antagonists  based  on  inhibitory  antibodies  or antagonistic ligand mimetics. Another approach could be to induce protection by activating TLRs and/or NOD1/2 to elicit nonspecific resistance effects and enhance host resistance to bacterial or viral infection. Workers at Corixa Corporation have extended the previous studies of AGPs (lipid A mimetics) and showed

that they provide remarkable protection in Listeria or influenza-virus challenge models, in which there is no administration of the microorganism itself or additional antigen 57 .

Considerable data indicate a role for the innate immune system in antiviral responses. The work of Finberg and colleagues 58 supports the contention that viral proteins might directly activate TLRs, such as TLR4, thereby  resulting  in  an  antiviral  response. Subsequently, it was shown that stimulation of TLR3 and TLR4 results in the induction of a subset of genes, including those that encode type I interferons, which inhibit viral replication 59 . Signalling from TLR3 and TLR4 has been shown to involve both the NFκ B and IRF3 pathways. More recently, a detailed understanding of these pathways has emerged from the efforts of Beutler and others 60-65 . In particular, it has been shown that pathways linked to TLR3 and TLR9 contribute to innate responses to systemic viral infection. Although neither pathway alone has a dominant role, mutations affecting both result in markedly decreased antiviral responses. Therefore, targeting the TLR3, TLR4 and TLR9 pathways allows for an enhanced response to certain viral infections. There are numerous small-molecule agonists that have the potential to enhance resistance to viral infection. A new strategy involving covalent linkage of antigen to CpG ODNs promises to provide an effective way of improving the immunomodulatory activities of CpG, by enhancing antigen uptake and stimulation of antigen-presenting cells 66,67 . This concept has been extended to clinical trials with the use of allergen-CpG ODN conjugates 68 .

## Targeting intracellular pathways

The important role of NFκ B in TLR signalling is now well established. The NFκ B-signalling pathways are one of the main targets for new drug discovery and development 69 . Numerous studies have shown that involvement of the IKK complex (inhibitor of NFκ B (I κ B)-kinase complex), a downstream element in TLR-signalling pathways, is essential. The two kinases present in the IKK complex, IKKα and IKKβ , are potential targets, and recent studies have been able to

non-selectively block IKK activity using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory  drugs. At  present, the  most progress towards developing selective inhibitors is in the development of selective small-molecule inhibitors of IKKβ . These might have applications in controlling events downstream of TLR activation in chronic disease. In particular, it is possible to envisage the use of such inhibitors to treat chronic inflammatory diseases, in which sterile inflammation that results from TLR activation is important. The use of other selective kinase inhibitors could also potentially control TLRdriven inflammation. The kinase targets might include IRAK4, RICK and the  mitogen-activated  protein kinases; this topic is not considered further here.

The current progress in defining the specific roles of members of the MyD88-adaptor family in TLR signalling offers new possibilities for the selective blockade of pathways downstream of the TLRs. We now require the development of new therapeutics to target specific protein-protein interactions. This has proven to be a formidable barrier, with only limited progress being  made. Screening  of conventional  chemical libraries comprising small-molecule drug-like structures  has  not  provided  compounds able to block protein-protein interactions. In part, this results from the typical flatness of the interface that characterizes protein-protein interactions. Large surface areas are involved, usually 750-1500 Å , and there are no deep 2 cavities present that could function as small-moleculebinding sites. Many researchers, including Wells and his co-workers 70 have defined 'hot spots' that represent the most important regions for high-affinity binding. As we accumulate knowledge about each type of molecule, the TLRs, NOD-protein-family members and adaptor proteins should become more tractable targets. There are several strong examples that support the contention that progress is being made. One is in the unrelated area of p53 interactions but the other provides data about the targeting of TIR domains. In the former, Vassilev et al . 71 have discovered a group of synthetic compounds, known as nutlins, that specifically block p53-MDM2 interactions. This finding followed a series of elegant studies by others, which were based on designing peptidic inhibitors and then identifying the specific binding site of p53 that mediates MDM2 binding.This work could well provide a model for future efforts in the design of drugs to target innate immune pathways.

In fact, Rebek and colleagues 72 have provided the much needed proof-of-concept that TIR domains could be targets for selective inhibitors. Using the TIR-domain interactions between MyD88 and the type 1 IL-1R (IL-1R1) as a model, they synthesized and characterized a low-molecular-weight MyD88 mimic, hydrocinnamoyl-l-valyl-pyrrolidine. This compound was developed by modelling a tripeptide sequence  of the  BB-loop  of the  TIR  domain  (F/Y)-(V/L/I)-(P/G). The compound seems to be selective  in  both  cell-based  and in  vivo systems. Development of this low-molecular-weight inhibitor of the TIR-domain interaction between MyD88 and

IL-1R1 indicates that the design of further selective inhibitors  of TIR-domain-containing  proteins  is within reach. This promises to yield an entirely new generation of potential anti-inflammatory compounds to modulate the innate immune system.

## Complications with therapeutics

As therapeutics, CpG ODNs might require administration over long time periods. The effect of chronic administration has not yet been addressed in detail. However, a recent publication reported the consequences of chronic CpG ODN administration 73 : mice given daily injections of CpG ODNs developed considerable  pathology  in  their  lymphoid  organs, with changes in both structure and function. Specifically, the report showed destruction of lymphoid-follicle architecture and suppression of follicular dendritic cells and germinal-centre B lymphocytes. Furthermore, after three weeks, multi-focal liver necrosis and haemorrhagic ascites developed. These effects were dependent on both CpG ODNs and TLR9.Additional studies will be required to determine whether the administration other TLR ligands induces similar effects and how the CpG-ODN-induced injury correlates with dosage and its more-beneficial effects.

The use of TLR antagonists might have applications in acute settings, in which dampening the proinflammatory response of the innate immune system is beneficial. In particular, TLR antagonists could be used to treat septic shock. However, the important role of the innate immune system in host defence against microorganisms indicates that only limited uses of antagonists will be found. Certainly, their use in any chronic settings will require a high degree of selectivity among the various TLRs. Determining how to maintain the balance between host-defence

functions and the potentially harmful effects that result from TLR activation remains a serious challenge for those designing new therapeutics.

## Conclusions

We now have detailed knowledge of the ligands,receptors and intracellular-signalling pathways that control innate immune responses during infection and inflammation, and this provides new approaches for highly selective therapeutics. New information about the role of NOD2 in human disease exemplifies how genetic approaches will increase our understanding of disease pathogenesis and how best to target individual proteins or pathways. The potential to modulate the innate immune system is supported by the first generation small-molecule ligands of TLR7 and TLR8,the imidazole quinolines.This class of drug was developed for topical use, targeting papillomavirus-induced warts, without understanding its exact mechanism of action. Furthermore, the ongoing trials based on targeting TLR9 with CpG ODNs will enhance our knowledge of the effects of blocking or enhancing selective pathways of innate immunity. It should now be possible to use our combined knowledge of the TLR- and NOD-protein-family  members, together  with  the recently developed tools for drug discovery, to identify new therapeutic molecules with selective actions. Our progress will only be limited by our ability to express the key proteins of the innate immune system for use in high-throughput screening assays, and our ability to develop small-molecule libraries containing chemical scaffolds that are directed towards the hot spots of protein-protein interactions. Hopefully, the fruits of ongoing basic research are within reach of the drugdevelopment community, and we will soon see how our newly found knowledge can be used to better treat human disease.
