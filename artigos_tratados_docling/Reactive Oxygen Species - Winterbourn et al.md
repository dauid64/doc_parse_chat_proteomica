## Abstract

Neutrophils are essential for killing bacteria and other microorganisms, and they also have a significant role in regulating the inflammatory response. Stimulated neutrophils activate their NADPH oxidase (NOX2) to generate large amounts of superoxide, which acts as a precursor of hydrogen peroxide and other reactive oxygen species that are generated by their heme enzyme myeloperoxidase. When neutrophils engulf bacteria they enclose them in small vesicles (phagosomes) into which superoxide is released by activated NOX2 on the internalized neutrophil membrane. The superoxide dismutates to hydrogen peroxide, which is used by myeloperoxidase to generate other oxidants, including the highly microbicidal species hypochlorous acid. NOXactivation occurs at other sites in the cell, where it is considered to have a regulatory function. Neutrophils also release oxidants, which can modify extracellular targets and affect the function of neighboring cells. We discuss the identity and chemical properties of the specific oxidants produced by neutrophils in different situations, and what is known about oxidative mechanisms of microbial killing, inflammatory tissue damage, and signaling.

## INTRODUCTION

Neutrophils are phagocytic white blood cells that are essential for effective innate immunity. They are recruited to sites of infection where they ingest and kill invading pathogens. They modulate the immune response and also contribute to ongoing inflammation in numerous diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, lung diseases, sepsis, atherosclerosis, and cancer (1-3). One of the hallmarks associated with the antimicrobial and inflammatory actions of neutrophils is the activation of a powerful oxidative burst, during which large amounts of oxygen are consumed and converted to superoxide radicals (see Table 1 for terminology). The enzyme system responsible is an NADPH oxidase complex that assembles in the membrane following activation. The superoxide dismutates to hydrogen peroxide, and in contrast to many other biological systems where superoxide and hydrogen peroxide are generated, neutrophils generate secondary oxidants via the activity of myeloperoxidase (MPO), an abundant peroxidase that constitutes approximately 5% of the protein in the cells. The production of these oxidants is critical for effective antimicrobial defense and is emerging as a regulator of other diverse neutrophil functions.

One of the challenges since the NADPH oxidase activity of neutrophils was first identified has been to dissect out how oxidant production contributes to their function and the mechanisms involved. This requires an understanding of when and where NADPH oxidase activation occurs, how MPO influences what oxidants are produced, and how the oxidants interact with the

## NEUTROPHIL BIOLOGY: A BRIEF OVERVIEW

As described in detail elsewhere (1, 3), neutrophils are produced in the bone marrow, are released into circulation, where they live for about a day, and migrate to their site of action along a chemical gradient of chemokines released by infectious agents or other inflammatory cells. They contain a multilobed nucleus, few mitochondria, and cytoplasmic granules containing numerous proteolytic and hydrolytic enzymes (4). Although they undergo limited protein synthesis, they express membrane receptors for infection-related and inflammatory stimuli that, when activated, initiate rapid expression of predominantly cytokine genes (5). Their most obvious activity is the phagocytosis and subsequent killing of microorganisms in internal vacuoles called phagosomes. They also produce immunomodulatory molecules that influence the recruitment and behavior of other inflammatory cells and, eventually, signal processes leading to the resolution of inflammation. Another neutrophil activity, first described in 2004, is the extrusion of chromatin structures termed neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), which have antimicrobial and inflammatory properties. Excessive activation or ineffectual clearance can lead to neutrophil lysis, tissue damage, and exacerbation of the inflammatory response.

Membrane assembly of NOX2. NOX2 is a multicomponent electron-transfer complex. The catalytic subunit gp91 phox comprises a membrane-spanning domain containing two stacked b-type cytochromes and an associated p22 subunit ( darker blue ) and a FAD-containing cytoplasmic domain ( light blue ). As described in detail elsewhere (7, 9-11), activation of the neutrophil leads to a series of phosphorylations that recruit cytoplasmic regulatory subunits ( pink ) to the cytoplasmic domain to give enzymatically active NOX2. Electrons are transferred singly to oxygen through a heme relay from FAD, which then undergoes two-electron reduction by NADPH. NADP + is recycled to NADPH through the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). The charge is balanced primarily through proton channels ( gray ). Note that electron flow is directional, from the cytoplasm to the external surface of the membrane.

## NOX2 AND SUPEROXIDE GENERATION

## Properties of Neutrophil NOX2

Stimulated neutrophils are the most intense physiological producers of superoxide radicals through the activation of the NADPH oxidase complex NOX2. In response to phagocytosis, immune stimuli, or bacterial components (6, 7), this complex assembles in the membrane and catalyzes the reduction of oxygen by a single electron, with the electrons shuttling through the complex from NADPH ( Figure 1 ). Oxygen consumption by neutrophils can increase to 100-fold of basal metabolic activity. Neutrophils and other professional phagocytes were the first cells shown to exhibit NADPH oxidase activity. The enzyme complex was originally named phagocyte oxidase, and it was thought to be unique for killing microorganisms. However, the neutrophil enzyme is now known to be one of a widely distributed family of NOX isoforms and (or, more correctly, its catalytic subunit gp91 phox ) is referred to as NOX2. In other cells, NOXs are activated in response to a wide variety of receptor ligands, and their main function is proposed to be the transmission of redox signals (8). As well as its established involvement in antimicrobial activity, other cell signaling functions of the neutrophil NOX2 are becoming apparent.

The enzymology of NOX2 has been widely studied, both in isolation and in the neutrophil (reviewed in 7, 9-11). On activation, there is rapid electron transfer from NADPH through the complex to oxygen. The neutrophil can maintain maximal activity down to a dissolved oxygen concentration of approximately 20 µ M (10% of air saturation) (12), and except under severe hypoxia, activity is more likely to be limited by the rate of reduction by NADPH. Based on measurements of the maximum rate of electron transfer in the isolated reconstituted enzyme, it

has been calculated that at full capacity NOX2 would oxidize all of the NADPH in the neutrophil (approximately 50 µ M) in less than 1 second (6). Early work showed that the regeneration of NADPH occurs via the pentose phosphate pathway, with 20% of normal activity sufficient to maintain an adequate NADPH supply (13).

AnimportantpropertyofNOXsisthatelectronflowisdirectional, from NADPHinthecytosol to oxygen on the external surface of the membrane ( Figure 1 ). Superoxide will, therefore, be released extracellularly when NOX2 is on the cell surface, but when activity is localized to internal membranes, such as phagosomes, it will be released into the enclosed vesicle. The directional nature of NOX2 activity also creates a charge imbalance that must be counteracted to prevent depolarization of the membrane and the shutdown of activity (6). Also, protons are produced in the cytosol and consumed in the external compartment (for example, the phagosome) through the dismutation of superoxide ( Figure 1 ). Both situations are largely overcome by a balancing flow of protons transported by voltage-gated proton channels, primarily VSOP/HV1, which are activated in parallel with the oxidase (14). The pH of the phagosome is regulated by these activities. In contrast to the phagosomes of macrophages, in which pH drops following particle ingestion, neutrophil phagosomes remain alkaline during the period that the oxidase is active. Until recently, their pH has been accepted to lie between 7.5 and 8. However, in a 2015 study using a probe that is moresensitive at higher pH, an average pH closer to 9 was measured in individual phagosomes (15).

## Sites of NOX2 Activation

To understand how neutrophils use superoxide and the other products of NOX2, it is important to know where and when the enzyme complex is activated. Detecting NOX activity is not straightforward, especially when it occurs at intracellular sites, as the oxidant products are short lived and often not accessible to detectors (reviewed in 16). One approach, as illustrated in Figure 2 a , is to show the sites of assembly of the NOX2 subunits by immunocytochemistry. Direct evidence of activation can be obtained from oxygen consumption measurements, although they do not provide information on location and may not detect low-level activity. Extracellular superoxide and hydrogen peroxide can be measured quantitatively by using specific detection systems, such as cytochrome c or Amplex Red (16). However, detecting intracellular NOX2 activity is more problematic and, at best, is qualitative rather than quantitative. The most definitive evidence of intracellular localization comes from electron microscopic studies that used the deposition of cerium peroxide to detect hydrogen peroxide and diaminobenzidine-Mn 2 + for superoxide (17, 18). Numerous investigators have used fluorescent or luminescent probes to study NOX activation, including dihydrodichlorofluorescein, dihydrorhodamine, and isoluminol. These are all oxidized by a radical mechanism involving peroxidase activity, and they are open to artifact and misinterpretation (reviewed in 19, 20). In neutrophils, peroxidase activity comes from MPO, and provided this is appreciated and the conditions are well controlled, useful information can be obtained (21, 22). As discussed for hypochlorous acid in the section Oxidant Production and Reactions in the Phagosome, more specific probes are becoming available, with the potential to provide much needed quantitative information.

NOX2 is strongly activated when neutrophils undergo phagocytosis. The majority of this activity is localized to the phagosomal membrane, thus directing superoxide into the phagosomal space. When a neutrophil recognizes particles for ingestion, the plasma membrane invaginates, forming, first, a cup and, then, an enclosed phagosome ( Figure 2 a ). This occurs extremely rapidly (in approximately 45 s) and the NOX2 subunits assemble before the phagosome is fully formed (23). Intracellular granules fuse with the developing phagosome, releasing MPO and a host of digestive enzymes. The majority of gp91 phox is associated with specific granule membranes, with

the remainder on the plasma membrane, so active NOX2 incorporates into the phagosome as the granule and plasma membranes fuse. Localization of NOX2 has been seen by immunostaining of the subunits ( Figure 2 a ), electron microscopy, and cerium peroxide detection (18), and in studies using ingested fluorescent probes (24, 25).

As shown diagrammatically in Figure 2 b , lesser amounts of NOX2 activation occur at other intracellular sites and on the cell surface following phagocytosis (18, 21, 22, 26). For example, NOX2 assembly has been detected in the vicinity of phagosomes, apparently associated with fusion between azurophil and specific granules (27). It is unclear whether this is a step that precedes integration with the phagosome or whether it represents an independent oxidative event. Electron microscopic studies have shown peroxide production at vesicular or endosomal sites that are apparently unrelated to antimicrobial activity (18).

NOX2is also activated by soluble stimuli without phagosome formation. With phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), a potent stimulus that is widely used experimentally ( Table 1 ), most activity is at the cell surface, but some occurs in intracellular vesicles (18, 22, 28). The latter sites have not been well characterized, but electron micrographs have shown a granular appearance of peroxide deposits associated with intracellular vesicles or endosomes, which may fuse with the plasma membrane (17, 18). Interaction with the bacterial peptide formyl-Met-Leu-Phe induces NOX2

activation and superoxide release only on the plasma membrane. NOX2 activation associated with other receptor-mediated processes has also been observed. Although less is known about the sites and consequences, there is increasing interest in determining whether this represents redox signaling activity (21, 22, 29).

Differences in the mechanism of NOX2 activation at different sites have been observed. For example, one of the regulatory subunits, p40, is required for activation at intracellular sites but not on the cell surface (30), and it appears that only intracellular activation is inhibited by the phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin (31). The duration of NOX activity also varies depending on the stimulus (6). With PMA, activity can be detected for up to 2 h. The timing during phagocytosis is more difficult to measure, as not all of the particles are taken up at the same time. However, when synchronized uptake was achieved with yeast particles, superoxide production peaked at 10-15 min, then gradually declined over a similar period (32). Likewise, when individual phagosomes were followed using fluorescent probes, oxidant production was maximal for up to 8 min following ingestion, then tailed off by 15 min (33, 34). Little is known about activation at nonphagosomal intracellular sites. Termination appears to involve phosphorylation steps rather than self-regulation by oxidative inactivation (6).

## THE REACTIVE OXYGEN SPECIES OF NEUTROPHILS

Neutrophils have the potential to generate almost the whole spectrum of radical and nonradical oxidants that are relevant to redox biology. It is common to refer to these as reactive oxygen species, or ROS.Thiscanbeausefulandconvenientcollective term. However, it is also widely misunderstood in the literature where ROS is often assumed to be a single, poorly defined entity that produces the same outcome regardless of which species are involved. This usage is not helpful, especially when trying to understand mechanisms, as the different species can have quite different reactivities. The most relevant oxidants produced by the neutrophil, apart from superoxide and hydrogen peroxide, are those generated by MPO. MPO uses hydrogen peroxide to oxidize a wide range of substrates to reactive products. These include nonradical oxidants, the main ones being hypochlorous and hypothiocyanous acids, as well as radicals produced from organic and inorganic substrates. Which of these reactive species is produced depends on whether MPO is present and the relative availability of its substrates, and this will differ depending on where NOX2 activation occurs.

Table 2 summarizes the chemistry of major neutrophil oxidants, and Figure 3 gives a pictorial representation of the relative reactivities of the nonradical oxidants with different substrates based on measured rate constants. Major differences are apparent. For hydrogen peroxide, apart from dedicated thiol and selenoperoxidases, reactions with thiol groups are slow and less favorable than reactions with transition metal centers. Notably, the latter are one-electron reactions and lead into radical chemistry. Hypochlorous acid reacts preferentially with thiols and methionine (Met) residues, with amines reacting more slowly. The chloramines produced by hypochlorous acid and amines also show selectivity for sulfur centers, although they are less reactive. Hypothiocyanous acid reacts almost exclusively with thiols. Other relevant features that distinguish between oxidants include whether they react by a one- or two-electron mechanism, as only the former initiate radical reactions such as lipid peroxidation, and whether they are restricted by permeability barriers.

## ENZYMOLOGY OF MYELOPEROXIDASE

Hydrogen peroxide reacts with the ferric form of MPO to give a strongly oxidizing and short-lived intermediate, Compound I. The reaction of Compound I with a halide completes a halogenation cycle ( Figure 4 ) in which the halide is oxidized by two electrons to the corresponding hypohalous

acid. MPO is unique among mammalian peroxidases in having a sufficiently high reduction potential (1.16 V) to oxidize chloride to hypochlorous acid (35). It also oxidizes bromide, iodide, and the pseudohalide thiocyanate. Thiocyanate is more reactive than chloride, but the greater abundance of chloride means that it is usually the preferred physiological substrate (36).

MPO also performs a peroxidase cycle in which Compounds I and II oxidize the substrate to its radical in single-electron steps ( Figure 4 ). Compound I generally reacts faster, and the Compound II reaction limits the rate at which the enzyme turns over. Physiological substrates include tyrosine, ascorbate, urate, serotonin, and nitrite (reviewed in 37, 38). MPO generates

radicals from many drugs and xenobiotics, particularly phenols and aromatic amines, and this may contribute to their toxic and immunogenic effects (39, 40).

MPOactivity is regulated by the reactions of the redox intermediates with superoxide (41). The product with ferric MPO is an oxy-heme complex, Compound III ( Figure 4 ). Compound III is formedwhenMPOisexposedtosuperoxideinthepresenceofchloride,andthisisthepredominant form in the neutrophil phagosome. It can be recycled by ascorbate and by superoxide (41, 42), the latter reaction being required to maintain MPO activity in the phagosome. As the products of the cycling of Compound III by superoxide are hydrogen peroxide and oxygen, MPO functions as a superoxide dismutase (SOD), although the slow reaction with Compound III makes it 10,000 times less effective than specialized SODs. Superoxide reacts rapidly with both Compound I and Compound II (41) and can, therefore, complete a catalytic cycle in which hydrogen peroxide oxidizes two superoxides to oxygen ( Figure 4 b ). This activity is inhibited by chloride, which competes for Compound I and, as discussed in the next section, is likely to be relevant in the phagosome if the chloride concentration is low. Superoxide can also overcome the inhibition of halogenation activity by substrates that react well with Compound I but poorly with Compound II

(37). Compound II accumulates under these conditions, but can be reduced by superoxide back into the halogenation cycle.

Hydrogen peroxide reduces Compound I of MPO, liberating molecular oxygen. In combination with its reaction with the ferric enzyme, this represents catalase activity, although in most circumstances this reaction is minor due to competing reactions with chloride or other substrates.

## OXIDANT PRODUCTION AND REACTIONS IN THE PHAGOSOME

The conditions under which NOX2 and MPO function dictate which oxidants are produced. For example, for neutrophils in plasma, extrapolation from experimental studies predicts that when NOX2isactivated on the external membrane accompanied by the release of MPO, the majority of the superoxide should dismutate and the hydrogen peroxide react with MPO. With typical plasma concentrations of 140 mM chloride and 30 µ M thiocyanate, and a 730-fold-higher specificity constant for the latter (36), about 80% of the product would be expected to be hypochlorous acid, the remainder being hypothiocyanite and approximately 10% radical products, due to the oxidation of urate and other peroxidase substrates (43).

The conditions in the phagosome are radically different from those in the cell's surroundings or used experimentally. As is evident from Figure 2 and shown diagrammatically in Figure 5 , there is extremely close contact between the ingested particle and the phagosome membrane, providing only a narrow space into which superoxide is released. Little external medium is taken up, and the release of granule contents results in high concentrations of proteins, including millimolar MPO. As calculated from oxygen consumption measurements, superoxide is generated at several millimolar per second (44). These extraordinary conditions have a number of important implications. MPO will turn over at an extremely high rate and oxidize the limited amounts of substrates present in the small volume unless they are replenished. Chloride is likely to be the main substrate, as the much lower concentrations of thiocyanate and peroxidase substrates should be rapidly oxidized and account for only a tiny fraction of the hydrogen peroxide generated. Although MPO can oxidize nitrite to the strongly oxidizing and nitrating nitrogen dioxide radical,

The main redox reactions are shown. Superoxide (O2 ·-) is released into the narrow space between the membrane and bacterium. The charge is balanced through proton channels. O2 ·-dismutation [mainly catalyzed by myeloperoxidase (MPO)] gives hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as a substrate for MPO, which is released from azurophil granules. Competition between chloride (Cl -) and O2 ·-regulates hypochlorous acid (HOCl) production.

very little nitration was detected inside neutrophil phagosomes, even in the presence of high nitrite (45). Nevertheless, lipid peroxidation has been observed when neutrophils ingest bacteria (46, 47), indicating that radical reactions do take place.

It is not feasible to sustain experimentally the high superoxide generation rates of the phagosome or to study the reactions of MPO at millimolar concentrations. However, modeling phagosomal conditions using known morphological and biochemical characteristics of the neutrophil and the kinetic properties of MPO provides insights into what reactions are likely to take place (41, 44). It shows that even though superoxide and hydrogen peroxide are formed extremely rapidly, hydrogen peroxide is consumed by MPO as fast as it is generated to give a steady-state concentration in the micromolar range ( Figure 6 a ). Most of the superoxide undergoes MPO-dependent dismutation via Compound III cycling, but it stabilizes at a high concentration of approximately 20 µ M. If the initial chloride concentration, estimated at 70 mM (48), can be maintained, MPO should convert the majority of the hydrogen peroxide to hypochlorous acid. However, with a

lower chloride concentration, superoxide is able to compete for Compound I ( Figure 5 ) and hypochlorous acid production declines ( Figure 6 b ).

Therefore, the ability of the neutrophil to keep generating hypochlorous acid in its phagosomes should depend on how rapidly chloride can be replenished. Painter &amp; Wang (48) measured about 70 mM chloride in phagosomes using a chloride-sensitive probe attached to beads and showed that chloride could enter from the cytoplasm, in part through the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (49). However, MPO was inhibited, so they did not address whether influx could keep up with hypochlorous acid formation.

Although the modeling is useful, it gives a simplistic representation of the phagosomal environment as a homogeneous solution, whereas granule fusion occurs progressively at discrete sites and superoxide is generated on the membrane. Also, it is apparent that not all phagosomes express active oxidase. Li and coworkers (23) detected NOX2 activation on only about half of the phagosomes formed when neutrophils ingested zymosan-immunoglobulin G complexes ( Figure 2 ), and we observed that a similar proportion of phagosomes gave a positive response to a fluorescent probe for hypochlorous acid (A. Albrett, unpublished observation). The implications of this heterogeneity are not understood. Also, modeling has been performed with kinetic data obtained at pH 7-7.8 and the effects of a higher phagosomal pH (15) need to be assessed.

There is substantial experimental evidence that hypochlorous acid is produced in neutrophil phagosomes (41, 50). This includes the detection of 3-chlorotyrosine in phagocytosed bacteria (51, 52) and in phagosomal proteins isolated after particle ingestion (53). MPO-dependent oxidation of Met residues in ingested Escherichia coli (54) and the chlorination of probes bound to phagocytosed particles (34, 45) have also been observed. Others have used real-time imaging with fluorescent probes to show localized hypochlorous acid production in individual phagosomes (24, 25). Recently, there has been an explosion in probe development, with nine new probes for hypochlorous acid reported in 2014 alone. In many cases, specificity and kinetic properties need further characterization, but they have the potential to further characterize oxidant activity.

A further conclusion from modeling phagosomal targets is that much of the hypochlorous acid would react with proteins close to the site of generation before reaching the microorganism (44). This conclusion is supported by experimental findings of more tyrosine chlorination in phagosomal proteins than proteins derived from ingested Staphylococcus aureus (51, 53). Based on reactivity ( Table 2 ), chlorotyrosine would be a minor product, so this implies that Met and

cysteine (Cys) residues in neutrophil proteins would be more extensively oxidized, as well as amino groups, to give chloramines. Although hydroxyl radicals and singlet oxygen can theoretically be formed from hypochlorous acid and superoxide or hydrogen peroxide, these should not be favored due to competing reactions (44).

## OXIDANTS AND ANTIMICROBIAL ACTIVITY

To fulfill their fundamental role, neutrophils must kill ingested microbes. This killing occurs within phagosomes, and it involves a battery of oxidative and nonoxidative antimicrobial mechanisms (50, 55, 56). Although not required for some organisms, oxidative killing is essential for broad spectrum antimicrobial defense. Evidence for this comes largely from the persistent infections associated with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) (3, 57), a condition in which NOX2 activity is lacking ( Table 1 ). Although defective killing cannot account for all of the problems associated with CGD, isolated neutrophils that lack NOX2 activity kill a wide range of microorganisms poorly, and this is a major contributor to the disease (56). The question is, which of the oxidants generated as a result of NOX2 and MPO activity have microbicidal activity? We discuss the evidence for the most likely contenders: superoxide, hydrogen peroxide, hypochlorous acid, and chloramines.

## Hypochlorous Acid

Low concentrations of hypochlorous acid kill a wide spectrum of microorganisms, and as recently reviewed (41, 58), the killing of many species of bacteria by isolated neutrophils is strongly impaired when MPO is absent. Although this does not necessarily exclude other peroxidase-dependent mechanisms operating in the neutrophil, the general consensus is that the amount of hypochlorous acid generated is sufficient to kill the ingested microbes (45, 50, 58). Rosen and coworkers (54) found the extent of MPO-dependent Met oxidation in ingested E. coli to be similar to that in isolated bacteria killed with hypochlorous acid, and others have shown that bacterial killing declines in parallel with hypochlorous acid production when neutrophils are placed in a low-chloride environment (53, 59, 60).

However, there are some puzzling observations. Even though it seems counterintuitive, the results of modeling of the phagosome imply that much of the hypochlorous acid would react with proteins close to the site of generation before reaching the microorganism (44). Furthermore, measurements showing more extensive tyrosine chlorination in phagosomal proteins than in proteins from ingested S. aureus (51, 53) imply that the former are exposed to more hypochlorous acid. One possible explanation is that killing occurs indirectly via chloramines. Based on the reactivity of hypochlorous acid ( Figure 3 ), the chlorination of tyrosine residues would be accompanied by substantially more oxidation of amino groups to chloramines. Although protein chloramines are not bactericidal, smaller chloramines, such as ammonia chloramine, that penetrate cells are cytotoxic (61). Another mechanism for increasing the effectiveness of hypochlorous acid would be for MPO to bind to the surface of the microbe. This occurs with some bacteria (62), and although only a small proportion of the total phagosomal MPO should be bound (41), it could direct some of the hypochlorous acid at its target.

For such a potent biocide, the mechanism of toxicity of hypochlorous acid is not fully defined. Early studies showed a loss of inner membrane-localized functions related to energy metabolism and the loss of ATP (50, 63, and references therein). Based on reactivity ( Table 2 ), Met and Cys should be likely targets. The greater sensitivity to hypochlorous acid of E. coli that lack methionine sulfoxide reductases points to the importance of Met oxidation (54). Bacterial Cys-containing

peptides, including glutathione (GSH), bacillithiol, and mycothiol, form mixed disulfides and provide protection when the bacteria are treated with hypochlorous acid (64, 65), but specific thiol modifications associated with toxicity have not been identified.

## Superoxide

Evidence that the other oxidants are effective microbicides is much more limited. Superoxide has limited reactivity, and the conventional view is to consider it merely as a precursor of hydrogen peroxide and other oxidants. However, this may not be correct. In 1975, Johnston and coworkers (66) observed that ingestion of SOD along with E. coli or S. aureus inhibited killing. Subsequently (67), a more modest effect with SOD bound to S. aureus was seen and attributed to superoxideenhancing MPO activity. Salmonella typhimurium , which contains a periplasmic SOD and survives when ingested by macrophages, is more susceptible to being killed by these cells when its SOD is absent (68, 69). This could not be an effect of MPO (which was not present in the macrophages), and in view of the poor penetrance of superoxide into cells, toxicity has been proposed to be due to an attack on an unidentified membrane target. S. typhimurium does not survive in neutrophils, and this has been attributed to killing by MPO-derived hypochlorous acid (70).

Adirect microbicidal effect of superoxide might be feasible in MPO-deficient neutrophils. Dismutation of superoxide in the phagosome will be much slower without MPO, and concentrations could reach 100 µ M(44). However, no mechanism is obvious because known targets for superoxide, such as iron-sulfur proteins (71), are intracellular and not accessible. If nitric oxide were generated concurrently, it would be expected to react rapidly with superoxide to give peroxynitrite, which is both a strong oxidant and microbicidal (72). Nitric oxide production by neutrophils has been observed but, at least for humans, requires stimulation with proinflammatory cytokines, and it is still not clear whether both radicals are produced at the same time. If so, a microbicidal role for peroxynitrite is feasible, especially in MPO deficiency.

## Hydrogen Peroxide

In sufficient concentrations, hydrogen peroxide is bactericidal. Toxicity involves reaction with intracellular iron-sulfur centers to release iron, and subsequent generation of hydroxyl and other reactive radical species via the Fenton reaction (71). Bacteria generate hydrogen peroxide endogenously (at an estimated rate of 10 µ M/s in E. coli ) but, through a combination of catalase and the peroxiredoxin AhpC, maintain an intracellular concentration of approximately 20 nM (73). These enzymes enable the bacteria to survive exposure of up to millimolar concentrations of hydrogen peroxide, and both enzymes must be knocked out to achieve sensitivity in the micromolar range (73). In addition, hydrogen peroxide reacts with the oxyR regulon in many bacterial species to upregulate the expression of antioxidant and repair proteins and to protect against toxicity. The activation of oxyR requires at least a 10-fold increase in intracellular hydrogen peroxide concentration, still well below the toxic range. The hydrogen peroxide in neutrophil phagosomes (predicted in Figure 6 a to be micromolar) was sufficient to activate oxyR in ingested in E. coli (74). However, the deletion of oxyR had no impact on survival when S. typhimurium was ingested by macrophages (70), from which the authors concluded that uninduced bacterial defenses are adequate to handle phagosomal hydrogen peroxide without it reaching the toxic range. The implication for the neutrophil is that even in MPO deficiency, where modeling predicts a hydrogen peroxide concentration of approximately 30 µ M (44), it still may be insufficient to kill.

## Electrogenic Effects

Segal and coworkers (15, 75) have proposed an alternative mechanism for the role of NOX2 in microbial killing. They propose that it acts as transmembrane electron transporter to bring counter ions into the phagosome to facilitate nonoxidative killing, that superoxide production is incidental to oxygen acting as an electron acceptor, and the role of MPO is to break down the oxidants produced. Although this proposal does not accommodate the body of reported evidence for oxidant-mediated killing, the electrogenic effect could have consequences, such as providing a driving force for secondary transport into negatively charged vesicles (76, 77).

## Overall Assessment

Tosumup,hypochlorous acid is the fastest acting and most potent antimicrobial oxidant produced by neutrophils, and the bulk of evidence points to it being primarily responsible for oxidative killing. As discussed in more detail elsewhere (58), it has the credentials to be the frontline defender in the neutrophil armory. There remains a conundrum, however. Although neutrophils from individuals with MPO deficiency kill many microorganisms poorly, in contrast to CGD, MPO deficiency is relatively common and only rarely associated with serious infection (56, 58). It is possible that there are NOX2-dependent backup mechanisms that perform adequately under most circumstances. The evidence that these involve hydrogen peroxide or superoxide is not particularly strong, and their nature continues to be debated (15, 41, 50, 55, 75, 78). Alternatively, the more severe phenotype associated with CGD may be a combination of the microbicidal defect and the dysfunctional regulation of the inflammatory response. Further investigation is clearly needed.

## BACTERIAL RESPONSES TO NEUTROPHIL OXIDANTS

Microorganisms do not surrender and accept their fate when ingested by neutrophils. Many pathogens have evolved mechanisms to combat or evade the neutrophil attack, some by targeting oxidative mechanisms. For example Salmonella secrete a protein that prevents the assembly and activation of NOX2 (79). Some bacteria export SOD into their periplasm, apparently as a survival mechanism (69, 80). It has also been proposed that the golden carotenoid of S. aureus , staphyloxanthin, is a virulence factor that acts as an oxidant scavenger (81), but this is in doubt because the virulence of a nonpigmented clone was not augmented when staphyloxanthin synthesis was introduced (82).

Many bacteria actively respond to protect themselves against oxidative injury. One strategy is to limit damage to existing constituents by upregulating genes for protective or repair enzymes. An example already discussed is the activation of the transcription factor oxyR by hydrogen peroxide (74). Sublethal hypochlorous acid and chloramines also induce changes in bacteria that enhance survival when exposed to higher doses. One well-characterized mechanism that has been observed in E. coli is activation of the chaperone protein HSP33 (83). HSP33 is a monomer containing four zinc coordinated Cys residues. These are readily oxidized to disulfides by hypochlorous acid, causing the release of zinc, unfolding, and dimerization to give an active holdase. HSP33 is then able to protect against the aggregation of other proteins that become oxidized at higher hypochlorous acid exposure (84).

Sublethal hypochlorous acid also activates transcription factors that upregulate the expression of survival genes and enable the bacteria to withstand higher doses (85). The broadly conserved transcriptional repressor NemR is selectively (although not exclusively) inactivated by

hypochlorous acid and chloramines. This occurs through the oxidation of a Cys residue, which is postulated to form a sulfenamide linkage with a neighboring lysine and, thus, induce a conformational change (86). The E. coli transcriptional regulators RclR and HypT are more specific for hypochlorous acid (87, 88). Cys oxidation is involved in RclR activation, whereas the sensitive sites in HypT appear to be Met residues. Although the nature of the protective mechanisms induced by hypochlorous acid still need to be identified and it is yet to be demonstrated whether these responses occur in phagocytosed bacteria, they could be useful markers for these species in the phagosome, as well as promising targets for antimicrobial therapy.

## INTRACELLULAR OXIDANT PRODUCTION AND CELL SIGNALING

As described above, NOX2 is activated in neutrophils in response to soluble stimuli and at nonphagosomal intracellular sites where it is unlikely to be involved in antimicrobial activity. This lower-level activity is more typical of the NOX activity associated with receptor-mediated signaling pathways in other cells (8), and there is growing interest in NOX2-dependent signaling in neutrophils (7, 29). In other cells, activation generally takes place in endosomes, caveolae, or membrane invaginations, and although detailed mechanisms have not been well established, in many cases signal transmission involves the oxidation of selected thiol proteins in phosphorylation pathways. Signaling in the neutrophil is still relatively unexplored, with little known about the extent of NOX activation at different sites, which oxidants are produced, and how they react. However, there are a few well-validated examples where an intracellular signaling function seems likely.

Oneisassociated with neutrophil migration down a gradient of the chemotactic peptide formylMet-Leu-Phe. This directional movement is associated with increased phosphorylation and the accumulation of phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5) triphosphate at the leading edge (89). It depends on colocalized activation of NOX2, and it has been proposed to involve oxidative inhibition of the phosphatasePTEN(90).Primingneutrophilstoenhancetheirresponsetoafullstimulus( Table 1 ) is another situation in which NOX2 is likely to act as a signal. Traditionally, priming has not been considered to activate the oxidase. However, Lamb et al. (26) have shown that endotoxin does cause low-level intracellular activation in a secretory vesicle-endosomal compartment. This has the hallmarks of a NOX-mediated redox signaling pathway, although downstream oxidative reactions have not been characterized. Neutrophil autophagy associated with antibacterial defense also appears to be redox-regulated through NOX2 activation (91, 92).

## Neutrophil Extracellular Traps

The discovery of NET formation is the most intriguing feature of neutrophils to emerge in recent years. NETs consist of networks of nuclear chromatin and associated proteins, primarily of granule origin (93). They are expelled from the cells in response to various stimuli, including PMA, bacteria, and crystals of urate or cholesterol (94, 95). Although much of the evidence is still inferential, they are proposed to have a positive function in host defense by trapping and aiding in the removal of bacteria (96). However, NETs are implicated in an ever-increasing range of inflammatory conditions in which they are postulated to have deleterious effects (2, 97).

In spite of the intense interest, surprisingly little is known about the molecular processes leading to NET formation and release. With most in vitro stimuli, they are formed 2-4 hours after stimulation of the neutrophils. Morphological changes, histone deimination, elastase mobilization, and chromatin condensation precede NET release (98-100), and autophagy has been implicated (91, 101). With almost all stimuli, NOX2 activity is required; NETs are not formed in CGD neutrophils or when NOX2 is inhibited (102-104). However, it is not known which oxidants

are involved, where and when they are produced, or what they react with. Superoxide, hydrogen peroxide, singlet oxygen, and hypochlorous acid have all been implicated (102, 103, 105), but many of these conclusions have relied on adding large doses of oxidant, or nonspecific or inappropriate inhibitors (102). Even in well-performed studies, the effects of oxidant scavengers have been modest or equivocal. Studies using inhibitors and MPO-deficient neutrophils have shown a dependency on MPO with PMA and some bacterial species (100, 104-107) but not with others (104). Further studies are required to establish how oxidants mediate this important neutrophil activity. However, the limited impact of extracellular scavengers, plus the induction of NETs by agents that cause modest oxidant production (94), raises the possibility that the process involves signaling by intracellular, nonphagosomal NOX activity (102, 108).

## Neutrophil Oxidants and Cell Death

Neutrophils in the bone marrow are exposed to survival factors that prevent them from undergoing apoptosis. Upon release into circulation, a spontaneous apoptosis program is activated, leading to the externalization of eat-me signals and removal by macrophages in the spleen and liver (109). This apoptosis is mediated through a conventional caspase-dependent pathway and occurs independently of NOX2 activation (110). In contrast, neutrophils at inflammatory sites are exposed to host and pathogen-derived factors that delay spontaneous apoptosis, enabling them to participate fully in the inflammatory process (109). The mode of death will influence the outcome of inflammation. Ingestion and clearance of the neutrophil before the discharge of intracellular contents are typically associated with an anti-inflammatory phenotype and the resolution of inflammation, whereas cell lysis will amplify the inflammatory response. Lysis may be valuable during severe infection, but will exacerbate tissue injury when the underlying infection is difficult to clear.

How neutrophils die following phagocytosis has not been well characterized, although NOX2 activation is involved (111). Neutrophils undergo a form of regulated cell death but not typical apoptosis. Morphological changes to the nucleus have been described as apoptotic (112), but this interpretation is complicated by the extensive intracellular rearrangements that occur as a consequence of ingesting large numbers of bacteria. Phosphatidylserine exposure is associated with subsequent uptake by macrophages and requires NOX2 activity (111). Hydrogen peroxide, as a bolus or generated continuously by glucose oxidase, is sufficient to trigger phosphatidylserine exposure in resting neutrophils (111). A potential mechanism is oxidation of the aminophospholipid translocase that transports phosphatidylserine to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane to maintain asymmetry. This enzyme contains oxidant-sensitive Cys residues, modification of which inhibits activity (113). Alternatively, the initial drop in cytosolic pH caused by NOX2 activation could activate ion channels and a Na + -H + exchanger in the phagosomal membrane. Activation of a Na + -H + exchanger triggers phosphatidylserine exposure in platelets (114).

Oxidative inactivation of caspases has been observed following neutrophil phagocytosis (115), although there has been a contrary report (116). This suggests that caspase-independent cell death can occur (110). One possibility is that the cells undergo an alternative form of regulated cell death, such as necroptosis, which occurs only when caspases are inactivated (117). The relevance of this pathway to neutrophils is not certain, as one study showed no effect of a necroptosis inhibitor on cell death (101) and another showed inhibition (118). The high dose used in the latter study may have caused off-target effects. Alternatively, neutrophil death may be a passive necrotic process associated with inhibition of the enzymes responsible for maintaining membrane integrity. Further research is required to determine the mechanism of cell death in activated neutrophils and which oxidative reactions are involved.

## REACTIONS OF RELEASED OXIDANTS

From a biochemical perspective, there are two main requirements for assessing the impact of neutrophil oxidants: specific biomarkers for detecting oxidant levels in clinical studies and characterization of the reactions that alter molecular or cellular function. Several biomarkers are available, the most specific to the neutrophil being products of hypochlorous acid (reviewed in 119). These include 3-chlorotyrosine and chlorohydrins formed from plasmalogens and other unsaturated lipids, which have the advantage of incorporating chlorine, and glutathione sulfonamide, a higher-oxidation product of GSH. Although these are only minor products of hypochlorous acid, they are detectable by sensitive mass spectrometry methods. These and other oxidative markers have been widely used to investigate numerous diseases. We will not try to cover this vast literature, but note that [as reviewed by Davies et al. (38)] elevated levels have frequently been seen and often correlate with disease severity. However, few studies have demonstrated a causal relationship.

In describing the reactions of neutrophil oxidants, we have focused on hypochlorous acid as the major oxidant that is characteristic of these cells. It should be noted that hypochlorous acid can be produced not only by activated neutrophils themselves but also from MPO that is released from the cells into plasma or inflammatory fluids as a result of NET formation, incomplete phagocytosis, or necrosis. For example, hypochlorous acid is produced when hydrogen peroxide is added to NETs and provides most of their bactericidal activity (120), and MPO is active when adhered to endothelium and in atherosclerotic lesions (121).

Almost every biological molecule that has been studied has been shown to react with hypochlorous acid (122, 123). Most of this evidence comes from studies with pure compounds and includes modification of DNA bases, membrane disruption, protein cross-linking, and inactivation of enzymes or ion channels through modification of Cys or Met residues. However, not every reaction that takes place in isolation will necessarily occur in a complex biological milieu. Relative reaction rates ( Figure 3 ), abundance, and proximity to the site of production will determine the significant targets.

## Modification of Extracellular Biomolecules

Reactions of hypochlorous acid with numerous components of body fluids or the extracellular matrix have been studied (122, 123). One of the first functional effects to be identified was inhibition of the antiprotease activity of the plasma protein α 1 -antitrypsin through the oxidation of Met residues. α 2 -Macroglobulin is also inhibited but gains chaperone activity for misfolded proteins (124). Low-density lipoprotein becomes recognizable by scavenger receptors (125); high-density lipoprotein becomes less effective at transporting cholesterol out of macrophages (126); extracellular matrix constituents become less cell-adhesive (127); the metalloproteinase responsible for cleaving von Willebrand factor, ADAMTS, is inactivated (128); and the prevalent neutrophil protein calprotectin loses metal-binding affinity (129). In most cases, Met or Cys oxidation has been characterized, and some of the proteins become cross-linked, but often the critical oxidative modifications have not been characterized. Further investigation is needed to assess which of these reactions takes place in more complex physiological environments.

## Effects on Neighboring Cells

Many of the inflammatory effects of neutrophil oxidants result from their interactions with neighboring cells, with high oxidant exposure causing cytotoxicity and sublethal doses having more subtle effects. Within the vasculature, surrounding red blood cells can scavenge the hydrogen peroxide generated by adjacent neutrophils through a combination of catalase and peroxiredoxin

activity. The detection of red cell peroxiredoxin oxidation in an endotoxin-stressed mouse model is evidence that this occurs in vivo (130). It also implies that the hydrogen peroxide could, in theory, react with other cells in the vicinity. Sublethal hydrogen peroxide has been shown to regulate numerous cell signaling pathways, including stress responses, shifts in metabolic activity, and phosphorylation cascades that lead to the production of inflammatory mediators, proliferation, growth arrest, or cell death (reviewed in 131, 132). Little is known about whether neutrophil hydrogen peroxide initiates these changes in a physiological setting or whether its effects are indirectly mediated via MPO.

High concentrations of hypochlorous acid lyse cells. As recently reviewed (133), sublethal doses cause a variety of biochemical changes, including activation of signaling pathways that could exacerbate or dampen an inflammatory response. As expected, GSH and protein thiols are major cellular targets. GAPDH oxidation is one of the most sensitive changes and could be metabolically significant, as it would divert glucose utilization to the pentose phosphate pathway (134). Cell permeable chloramines exert similar effects to hypochlorous acid, and the effects of hypochlorous acid on cells in culture media are due mainly to chloramines generated from amines in the media (135). Signaling responses to both oxidants include activation of the Nrf2 stress response and MAP kinase pathways (136, 137). They also inhibit NFκ B activation by oxidizing a Metresidue in I κ Bandpreventingits degradation (138, 139), thereby inhibiting cellular expression of adhesion molecules and inflammatory cytokines (140, 141). Again, the physiological relevance of these changes during inflammation is yet to be established.

Oxidation of GSH and multiple thiol enzymes, including GAPDH, protein tyrosine phosphatases, and caspases, has been observed in cells treated with hypothiocyanite (133, 142, 143). Thelowcytotoxicity of hypothiocyanite has led to a proposal that a shift from hypochlorous acid to hypothiocyanite production by MPO could provide a protective advantage to exposed cells (144). However, it remains uncertain whether hypothiocyanite is pro- or anti-inflammatory (145). It is reduced by thioredoxin reductase, which could provide antioxidant protection (146), but it also upregulates inflammatory mediators via the MAP kinase and NFκ B pathways (147) and activates a caspase-independent form of cell death (142, 143).

## INHIBITION OF NEUTROPHIL OXIDANT PRODUCTION

Although NOX2 activity and oxidant generation are essential for the microbicidal activity of neutrophils, limiting the effects of oxidants could be advantageous in situations of prolonged activation and inflammation. One way of accomplishing this would be to scavenge the oxidants with antioxidants. This strategy has been feasible in some experimental studies. However, it is seldom a practical therapeutic option because the scavenger concentrations required to outcompete physiological targets tend to be prohibitively high.

Another approach would be to inhibit NOX2. Inhibitors have been employed in numerous experimental studies, but the search for therapeutic agents still has to overcome major obstacles regarding specificity and potency (148). Diphenylene iodonium fully inhibits superoxide production by all NOX isoforms and has been the most widely used experimentally. A significant limitation is that it also inhibits other flavoproteins. Although its interaction with the heme groups in the NOXs give them a lower 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50 = 1 µ M) than other flavoproteins (148, 149), low NOX selectivity and off-target effects make diphenylene iodonium an unsuitable starting point for drug development.

Apocynin inhibits the assembly of the NOX complex. It has been used in vitro as a NOX inhibitor and shown to have anti-inflammatory effects in several animal models (148). However,

mechanistic studies have indicated that it requires activation by MPO to inhibit NOX (150), and it is unclear whether NOX2 inhibition is responsible for its anti-inflammatory effects.

Several specific peptide inhibitors, including NOX2ds-tat, which blocks interaction between the gp91 and p47 subunits, have shown good specificity and potency for inhibiting superoxide production by NOX2. However, peptides are difficult candidates for drug development. Several high-throughput screens of nonpeptide drug libraries have produced promising hits for general NOXinhibition but, as yet, no specific NOX2 inhibitor (148).

Although the potential for treating inflammatory diseases justifies the continued search for NOX2 inhibitors, there are potential risks of increased susceptibility to infection and proinflammatory phenotypes, as has been seen in humans and mice lacking NOX2 activity. For a more focused approach, there are advantages in targeting MPO. This would impact mainly on neutrophils (and monocytic cells) and limit production of their strongest oxidants, such as hypochlorous acid. Numerous compounds that inhibit MPO have been identified, but no drugs are available.

MPOinhibitors fall into four classes: competitive substrates, suicide substrates, those that bind tightly to the ferric enzyme, and those that convert the enzyme to an inactive redox intermediate (125). The fourth class is less effective because endogenous substrates, including superoxide, recycle the enzyme back to its active form. Acetaminophen at pharmacological doses outcompetes chloride for oxidation and inhibits in this way (151). It is oxidized by a radical mechanism to aminoquinine, which is potentially undesirable, but the normally safe profile of acetaminophen suggests that it could be useful during acute inflammation.

2-Thioxanthines and related compounds are suicide substrates for MPO (152). Their oxidation products covalently bind to its heme groups so that it cannot oxidize chloride. They have clinical potential because they undergo limited oxidation to radicals, but their potency is limited because they must compete with endogenous substrates for oxidation.

Compounds that stop MPO reacting with hydrogen peroxide by binding tightly to the active sites have the greatest potential as inhibitors of the enzyme because they do not need to compete against high concentrations of endogenous substrates, and they are not metabolized to radical species. Aromatic hydroxamates bind extremely tightly but, unfortunately, are unstable under physiological conditions (153). However, exploring this strategy has promise for developing drugs that block the unwanted action of MPO-derived oxidants.

## CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS

Theenzymaticactivities of the NOX2 and MPO systems have been well characterized, and we have a good understanding of which reactive oxidants they are capable of producing. These enzymatic activities are important for neutrophils to kill microorganisms efficiently, and it has become appreciated that they have a range of other cellular functions. However, a lot of phenomenology surrounds the oxidative mechanisms involved in these processes. To gain greater mechanistic understanding, more biochemical studies are needed that identify the specific oxidants produced under different conditions and at different sites and to characterize their molecular targets. A number of questions need to be addressed. There is still uncertainty about the oxidative mechanisms in the phagosome that are responsible for microbicidal activity in the presence and absence of MPO, the role of reactive chlorine species, and whether ingested bacteria sense and upregulate defenses against these reactive oxidants. Regarding the signaling functions of NOX2, there is little or no information on which oxidants are responsible and the nature of their interactions with the regulatory pathways. Finally, neutrophil oxidants modify numerous biomolecules and cellular functions, but we need to know which of these occur physiologically and contribute to the pathology of inflammation.
