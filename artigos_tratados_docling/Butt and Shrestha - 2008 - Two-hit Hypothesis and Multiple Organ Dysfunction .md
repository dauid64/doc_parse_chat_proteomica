## AbstrAct

A severe insult in the form of infection or trauma primes the host immune system so that a subsequent, relatively trivial  insult  produces a markedly exaggerated host immune response, which can lead to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and death.  This forms the basis of the 'two-hit hypothesis' (THH), which is being increasingly recognised as an important cause of morbidity and mortality following severe injury and sepsis, particularly in intensive care settings.  Appreciation of the impact of repeated insults and pathophysiology of MODS is vital in the prevention of this serious complication. We describe a case which illustrates the concept of THH and MODS and present a review of literature on this subject.

Key words: laparotomy, multiple organ dysfunction, sepsis, two-hit hypothesis

## IntroductIon

Patients  exposed  to  a  severe  primary  insult,  e.g. infection  or  trauma,  can  develop  rapidly  progressive multiple  organ  dysfunction  syndrome  (MODS)  if  a subsequent  immune  stimulus,  'second  hit',  occurs. 1 The initial serious injury primes the immune system for an exaggerated inflammatory response to a subsequent stimulus  such  as  nosocomial  infection  or  surgical trauma, which has promulgated the concept of 'twohit hypothesis' (THH). 2   At present, MODS remains the most common cause of death in the surgical intensive care units (ICU).  We present a case which illustrates the concept of the THH and MODS and review recent literature on this topic.

## cAse rePort

An 86-year-old female was admitted, via accident and emergency department, with three days, history of lower abdominal pain, vomiting and absolute constipation. In

the past, she had undergone hysterectomy 30 years ago for  dysfunctional uterine bleeding. She had no significant cardio-respiratory co-morbidities. On examination, she was alert and hemodynamically stable. The abdomen was distended with mild lower abdominal tenderness without  any  evidence  of  peritonitis.  Routine  blood results  showed  normal  hemograms,  renal  and  liver function tests. Plain abdominal X-ray (Figure 1) showed dilated  loops  of  small  intestine.  Chest  X-ray  (Figure 2)  revealed consolidation of both lung bases with no evidence of pneumo-peritoneum. As the abdominal pain worsened, a CT scan of the abdomen was performed which showed features of small intestinal obstruction. At  laparotomy,  the  ileum  was  grossly  distended  and adherent to the old midline wound scar with rotation on  its  mesentery.  However,  the  blood  supply  to  the segment of intestine was well preserved. Several interloop  adhesions  were  taken  down  and  mass  closure of  the  abdominal  wound was performed with loop O PDS.

On  the  second  post-operative  day,  the  patient  was agitated and confused and gradually became oliguric. The abdomen was tender, grossly distended with absent bowel sounds. There was reduced air entry at both lung bases. The white blood cell count had fallen to 1.6 x 10 9 /L from 5.2 x10 9 /L at the time of admission. Repeat contrast-enhanced  CT  scan  showed  massive  bilateral pleural effusion and free fluid in the peritoneal cavity (Figure  3).  The  loops  of  small  intestine  were  grossly dilated but without any evidence of ischaemia as there was  normal  enhancement.  Resuscitation  was  carried out with intra-venous infusions and continuous positive airway  pressure  ventilation  which  restored  her  urine output and mental status. At this stage, she did not require any inotropic support to maintain haemodynamic stability.

At second-look laparotomy, there was a litre of bile in the peritoneal cavity. The small intestine, although dilated, was normal in appearance. Careful search revealed a 4 mm perforation over the fundus of the gall bladder through which bile was leaking. Cholecystectomy was carried  out  and  the  abdomen  was  closed  following  a thorough peritoneal lavage with saline. In the immediate post-operative period, she required continuous infusion of noradrenaline and dobutamine to maintain the blood pressure. She remained oliguric with severe metabolic acidosis  (blood  pH  of  7.3,  base  deficit  of  6.2  and

blood  lactate  of  5  mmol/L).  Despite  intensive  care management,  progressive  deterioration  led  to  death after 18 hours following the second-look laparotomy.

## dIscussIon

The  origin  of  the  concept  of  THH  lies  in  clinical observations made over 20 years ago. The development of THH after a second surgical procedure, e.g. fracture fixation  in  an  otherwise  young  fit  patient  who  had undergone splenectomy and seemed to be improving from the initial insult, stimulated the research promulgating  the  concept  of  THH. 3,4   Fundamental  to the concept of the THH is a pathologically exaggerated inflammatory response to a second physiological insult.  The  exaggerated  nature  of  this  response  is a  consequence  of  the  'priming'  of  immune  effector cells by the first insult. 5  Cell priming is defined as an enhanced  response  to  a  stimulus  as  a  consequence of prior stimulation by another agonist. If the second insult occurs during the window of vulnerability prior to down-regulation of the primed immune reactants, the

inflammatory response is seen to balloon beyond that which would otherwise have occurred. 6   In our case, the systemic response to biliary peritonitis and second laparotomy,  having  been  primed  by  intervention  48 hours earlier, proved terminal.

The  response  of  the  polymorphonuclear  neutrophils (PMN)  to  priming  is  well  characterised. 7   Generation of  free  radicals  like  reactive  oxygen  species  (ROS), and  reactive  nitrogen  species  (RNS),  degranulation of  enzymes,  cytokine  expression,  integrin  expression and delayed apoptosis, amongst other responses, has shown to be enhanced after priming with agents such as  tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha interleukin-6 (IL6), IL-8, ILK-10, platelets activating factor (PAF), and lipopolysaccharides (LPS). 8,9  Studies have shown that monocytes and macrophages may also become similarly primed  after  a  severe  insult.  Activated  endothelium, with increased expression of adhesion molecules, intercellular  adhesion  molecules  (ICAM)  and  vascular cell adhesion molecules (VCAM) have a central role in the magnified response to the second hit. 10

The understanding of the pathophysiology and management of MODS has progressively evolved since the establishment of the first ICU in Baltimore, USA in the 1950s. 11  Baue in 1975 introduced the concept of MODS and suggested that each organ abnormality was simply the local manifestation of a systemic process, hence, therapy should be targeted to the fundamental mechanism in its pathogenesis. 12   Due to the complex nature  of  the  disease  process  and  limitations  in  the ability to describe and characterise them, the therapy for prevention of MODS still remains in infancy.

MODS is preceded by the activation of adaptive host stress response to a wide variety of systemic insults including surgery, trauma, burns and severe infections, and includes changes in the cardiorespiratory function, increased microvascular permeability, activation of innate immune  mechanisms,  and  alteration  in  the intermediary metabolism. This is termed sepsis when caused by infection and systemic inflammatory response syndrome when considered independent of the cause. 13 The  adaptive  response  to  these  injurious  agents  can precipitate cellular and organ dysfunction, which may ultimately  lead  to  death  of  the  host.    Recovery  from MODS may result in partial or total permanent loss of functions of vital organs as a consequence of cellular damage and fibrosis that occur during the process of recovery. 14

Intra-abdominal  pressure  (IAP)  of  over  25  mm  Hg leading  to  abdominal  compartment  syndrome  (ACS) is  often  associated  with  MODS. 15   It  is  a  common practice  to  measure  IAP  regularly  in  intensive  care settings  to  recognise  ACS  early  so  that  measures

such as nasogastric or colonoscopic decompression of the  intestines,  laparostomy  with  wound  management using Bagota bag, Wound  ManagerÂ®  or  vacuumassisted  closure  devices  are  employed  to  reduce  the mortality. 16

Prevention of MODS should be in the highest priority in all clinical settings, which is possible through avoidance of secondary insults. Halting the progression of existing organ dysfunction while preventing the development of new organ dysfunction should be approached through optimisation of haemodynamic, metabolic, and immune homeostasis.    Occult  infection,  particularly  infection arising within the abdomen, is an important risk factor for MODS, which should be carefully looked for in all cases of unexplained MODS. 18  Patients with established MODS should be managed in a high-dependency or ICU settings with provision for ventilatory, cardiovascular, renal and other ancillary supports. MODS is potentially manageable  when  the  factors  responsible  for  the persistence or progression of MODS can be reversed. 18

In  our  patient,  release  of  adhesions  at  the  first  laparotomy, with subsequent reperfusion and exposure of PMNs to the previously ischemic, but viable gut vascular bed may have resulted in PMN priming by the same mechanism. The cascade of exaggerated responses as results of the second insults such as the intra-abdominal sepsis (bile peritonitis) and trauma of the second-look laparotomy resulted in MODS and mortality.  The bile leak from the perforation of the gallbladder detected at the secondlook laparotomy could have resulted either from an injury during adhesiolysis at the initial laparotomy, or from an ischaemic  infarction  of  the  fundus  of  the  gallbladder which has resulted from over-distension and pressure necrosis.  One could speculate a missed perforation of the gallbladder at the first laparotomy, but the absence of free bile in the peritoneal cavity and lack of peritonism rule out this possibility. Meticulously performed surgery with attention to details and early recognition of intraabdominal catastrophe are paramount in the prevention of MODS.

## conclusIons

In conclusion, despite progress in the ICU management of  critically  ill  patients,  MODS  evolves  and  worsens, particularly in patients who undergo repetitive invasive procedures for infective conditions. Goal-directed therapies, supportive  management,  as  well  as  an understanding  of  the  inflammatory  process  are  keys to  decreasing  the  mortality  rate  among  patients  with MODS resulting  from  a  second  set  of  insults,  which may be in the form of intra-abdominal sepsis, surgical trauma or a combination of both.
