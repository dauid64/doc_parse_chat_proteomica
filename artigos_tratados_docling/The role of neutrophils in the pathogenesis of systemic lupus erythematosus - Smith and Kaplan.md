## The role of neutrophils in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus

Carolyne K. Smith and Mariana J. Kaplan

## Purpose of review

Recent discoveries implicate neutrophils as important regulators of innate and adaptive immunity and in the development of organ damage in systemic autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).

## Recent findings

Various putative SLE biomarkers are neutrophil-related, including neutrophil granular proteins and histones undergoing post-translational modifications during neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation. In the bone marrow, lupus neutrophils can drive B and T cell abnormalities, at least in part, by their enhanced production of type-I interferons, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF a ) and the B-cell stimulating factors B-cell activating factor (BAFF) and a proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL). Lupus neutrophils and, in particular, lupus low-density granulocytes (a distinct pathogenic subset) display epigenetic modifications and genomic alterations that may be relevant to their deleterious roles in SLE. Proteins and enzymes externalized by lupus NETs can affect vascular health by inducing endothelial apoptosis and oxidizing lipoproteins. Hampering NET formation through peptidylarginine deiminase inhibitors abrogates lupus phenotype and atherosclerosis in murine studies.

## Summary

Recent discoveries support the notion that neutrophils, low-density granulocytes and aberrant NET formation and clearance play important roles in lupus pathogenesis. Future studies should focus on how to selectively target these immunostimulatory pathways in this disease.

## Keywords

bone marrow, low-density granulocytes, neutrophil extracellular traps, neutrophils, systemic lupus erythematosus

## INTRODUCTION

Neutrophils are the most abundant leukocytes in human blood and one of the first immune subsets to respond to a microbial insult. Once at the site of injury, neutrophils display various mechanisms of host defense, including expulsion of granular antimicrobial peptides (gAMPs) such as myeloperoxidase (MPO), neutrophil elastase and matrix metalloproteinases(MMPs);phagocytosisofthemicroorganism, followed by their degradation via acid or reactive oxygen species (ROS) inside phagolysosomes; and trapping and exerting microbicidal effects through the extrusion of a chromatin/gAMP meshwork termed neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) [1]. Once released from the bone marrow, the average life of a neutrophil is short and cells typically die by apoptosis [2-4]. A significant percentage of bone marrow weight is devoted to neutrophil production [5]. Although typically associated with innate immune responses, neutrophils have recently been

shown to act as important regulators of adaptive immunity [6].

## NETOSIS

Theprocess of NETosis was first described in 2004 as a novel cell death mechanism by which neutrophils extrude their chromatin, bound with gAMPs, to trap and inactivate pathogens [7]. As there are many recent reviews about this pathway and much remains

## KEY POINTS

- /C15 Lupus neutrophils display distinct genomic and epigenetic modifications that may contribute to their pathogenic role in this disease.
- /C15 The lupus bone marrow provides a unique niche for neutrophils to activate adaptive immune responses.
- /C15 Abrogation of enhanced NET formation may decrease oxidative damage, type I IFN responses and vascular disease in SLE.

to be clarified, we will only highlight some of the key knownmechanismsimplicated in NET formation. In brief, upon exposure to infectious (bacterial, fungal, viral, parasite) and/or specific sterile stimuli (cytokines, autoantibodies, immune complexes and so on), neutrophils can be induced to form NETs in vitro and in vivo . Following an activation signal, NADPH oxidase-(NOX) and superoxide dismutase generated H2O2 promote the migration of granular neutrophil elastase to the nucleus, a process that is MPO-dependent [8 ,9]. Nuclear neutrophil elastase then cleaves &amp; histonestoelicitchromatindecondensation.Nuclear peptidylarginine deiminase (PAD)-4 further assists in chromatin decondensation. By changing the positively charged histone arginine residues to more neutrally charged citrulline residues, PAD4 histone citrullination likely dampens the electrostatic interactionbetweenhistonesandnegativelychargedDNA [10]. The nuclear and granular membranes degrade, allowingchromatinmaterialandgranularproteinsto mix in the cytoplasm. Finally, the chromatin/gAMP meshwork is extruded from the cell and the process leads to cell lysis.

In addition to this 'suicidal' NETosis, other pathways leading to NET formation have been reported. 'Vital', non-lytic NET formation is rapidly induced upon exposure to certain microbes and produces an anuclear but still viable cell. Additionally, some NETs may primarily extrude mitochondrial (not genomic) DNA [11-13]. These points have yet to be fully elucidated and are out of the scope of this review. Further studies, however, should assess whether patients with autoimmunity favour lytic versus nonlytic mechanisms of NET formation and what implications this has for induction of inflammatory responses and tissue damage.

## Systemic lupus erythematosus neutrophils, low-density granulocytes and enhanced neutrophil extracellular trap formation

A plethora of neutrophil abnormalities have previously been described in SLE. A significant proportion

of SLE patients can manifest with neutropenia at some point during their disease [14,15]. Lupus neutrophils show impaired phagocytic capabilities [16,17], an inability to be cleared by the C1q/calreticulin/CD91-mediated apoptotic pathway [18] and abnormal oxidative activity [19-21]. Lupus patients also possess a distinct granulocyte population named low-density granulocytes (LDGs) [22]. These cells are identified in mononuclear cell fractions following density separation, display enhanced capacity to synthesize proinflammatory cytokines, including type I interferons (IFN-I), and are significantly toxic to endothelial cells [23,24]. Importantly, lupus LDGs are primed to form exuberant NETs in the absence of added stimulation [23]. By forming enhanced NETs, LDGs externalize enhanced levels of autoantigens and immunostimulatory molecules [23,25-27]. Furthermore, complement proteins or gAMPs present within NETs protect it from degradation by nucleases, while enhanced DNA oxidation in NETs can promote intracellular sensing in target cells [2729]. Furthermore, NETs have important effects on target cells: they promote plasmacytoid dendritic cells to synthesize higher levels of IFNa [25]; they activate the NLRP3 inflammasome in macrophages through P2X7 receptor pathways, leading to enhanced interleukin (IL)-1 b and IL-18 production [30]; and they kill endothelial cells [23]. Enhanced NET formation does appear to occur in SLE in vivo , as it is detected in affected tissues, such as kidney and skin, and peripheral blood [23].

## Neutrophil-related systemic lupus erythematosus biomarkers

As NETosis is accelerated in SLE, assays for NET remnants are being developed to determine the role of this cellular process in SLE activity or prognosis. Zhang et al. [31] demonstrated that the amount of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is significantly higher in SLE than healthy serum. Furthermore, patients with active lupus nephritis had significantly more cfDNA than non-active lupus nephritis patients. The amount of cfDNA positively correlated with proteinuria, and both LDG and neutrophil counts. In this case, cfDNA was quantified by the PicoGreen assay. This method, however, cannot distinguish DNA from neutrophils versus other cell subsets, and whether this DNA is derived from NETting cells versus apoptotic/necrotic cells.

Post-translational modifications (including acetylation, citrullination and methylation) to histones (H1, H2A, H2B, H3, H4) may provide hints regarding which form of cell death a neutrophil is undergoing [19,32,33]. SLE NETs were reported to contain significantly more lysine (K) hyperacetylated H4-K8,

H4-K12, H4-K16, H2B-K12 and trimethylated H3K27thancontrolneutrophil NETs [34]. Furthermore, Dwivedi et al. [35,36] recently demonstrated that as a linkerhistone,H1ispronetoPAD4citrullinationand maybecomeapotentepitopeforSLEautoantibodies. Histone citrullination occurs during NET formation secondary to PAD4 activity [37].

Another marker for the enhanced neutrophil activity in SLE may be the presence of serum neutrophil granular products, although this will not distinguish between NETosis or degranulation. Whether the enhanced levels of a particular granular protein may be lupus-specific remains to be determined. The level of serum neutrophil a -defensins (HNP1-3) has been reported as an independent indicator of lupus nephritis, positively correlating with proteinuria and disease activity [38]. Although plasma MPO levels are elevated in SLE [39 &amp;&amp; ], Wang et al. [40] showed that it is even higher in other inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or dematomyositis.

Currently, neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin (NGAL), also known as lipocalin-2 (a granular protein externalized in NETs), is considered a promising lupus nephritis biomarker [41]. Although already reported as an indicator of disease activity and progression, NGAL levels were also found to be associated with response to treatment in lupus nephritis. High NGAL levels are more specific to SLE than RA,systemicsclerosisorSjogren'ssyndrome,andalso correlate with juvenile lupus nephritis activity and SLE-related cognitive decline [42-46]. More work with larger cohorts of SLE and other inflammatory disease groups is needed to accurately assess the sensitivity and specificity of these biomarkers.

## Genetics and epigenetics of lupus neutrophils

A recent study compared the DNA methylome of lupus neutrophils, lupus LDGs and control neutrophils. The analysis revealed that both lupus neutrophils and LDGs demonstrate a pattern of robust demethylation of IFN-I signature genes, thereby suggesting a model in which externalization of hypomethylated DNA by lupus neutrophils in NETs could enhance IFN-I production via Toll-like receptor (TLR)-9 stimulation [47 &amp;&amp; ]. SLE lymphocytes were previously shown to be hypomethylated at specific retroelement sites [48]. Recently, SLE neutrophils were also reported to be hypomethylated, at long interspersed element-1 (LINE-1) [49].

LDGs have increased level of copy number alterations and losses in heterozygosity, as assessed by cytogenetic microarray analysis, as well as microsatellite instability [50 ]. &amp; This analysis indicates

somatic alterations that are consistent with DNA strand break repair and a replication error-prone status. As normal-density neutrophils from the same patients did not display these abnormalities, these findings also suggest that LDGs are a distinct granulocyte subset [50 ]. &amp;

## Neutrophils as inflammatory mediators or 'helper' cells

The concept of neutrophils not only as inflammatory cytokine producers but also as 'helper' cells for adaptive immune responses is relatively new, but is receiving expanding attention especially in lupus research [51]. The bone marrow of lupus patients, in particular, seems to be morphologically different from healthy individuals and a uniquely active site for neutrophil inflammatory pathways [52 ]. The &amp; 564Igi lupus mouse model develops RNA autoantibodies and possesses enhanced levels of IFN-I, which is mainly produced by their highly activated bone marrow neutrophils [53]. The high B-cell, neutrophil and IFN-I activity seen in these mice appears to be TLR-8 dependent [54]. This fits with the study by Lindau et al. [55 ] that neutrophils are a significant &amp; producer of IFN in response to chromatin or CpGODNstimulus, regardless of TLR-9 expression and to the report that LDGs have an enhanced capacity to synthesize IFN-I [24].

Studying both SLE patients and lupus-prone mice, Palanichamy et al. [56 &amp;&amp; ] demonstrated that bone marrow neutrophils are the primary producers of IFN-I, as well as the B-cell activating cytokines A proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL) and B-cell activating factor (BAFF). Furthermore, IFN-I signatures were enhanced in bone marrow when compared with peripheral blood. The high IFN signature seen in the bone marrow may be key to inducing the abnormal B-cell phenotypes seen in SLE, with changes in pre- and pro-B cells and in T1/T2 transitional B cells in this compartment. The receptor for BAFF and APRIL expressed on B cells, B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA), is important for B-cell survival. Yet, when BCMA is knocked out, the mice get an enhanced lupus phenotype including high autoantibody levels. In this model, it has been proposed that splenic neutrophils drive B-cell and T-cell activation [57 ], &amp; as neutrophil depletion leads to a decrease in germinal center B cells, autoantibodies, BAFF expression and IFN g þ T cells.

## Mechanisms of enhanced NETosis in systemic lupus erythematosus and potential therapeutic targets

The mechanisms leading to enhanced NET formation and impaired NET degradation in SLE

Volume 27 /C15 Number 5 /C15 September 2015

FIGURE 1. Neutrophil-mediated pathogenesis in SLE. Bone marrow neutrophils may be potent sources of type I IFN, BAFF and APRIL, which promote B- and T-cell activation. NETosis can be induced by autoantibodies, leading to the release of autoantigens and thus autoantibody production. The oxidative machinery produced by NETs (MPO, NOS and NOX) can lead to CVD-associated HDL oxidation. NET-bound MMP-9 leads to enhanced endothelial cell death. LL-37 in NETs enhances inflammasome activation and pDC stimulation, prompting IL-1b /IL-18 and IFN production, respectively. Antimalarials and PAD-inhibitors may dampen these neutrophil-mediated cell death and proinflammatory signaling pathways, which otherwise can contribute to SLE pathogenesis.

remain to be characterized. Cytokines, immune complexes and autoantibodies have been proposed [26,58,59]. It remains to be determined whether abrogation of NET formation will be beneficial in SLE. Initial studies [37,60] in murine systems implicate that PAD4 could be considered a potential therapeutic target in this regard. PAD4 is required for NET formation, as demonstrated by genetic and pharmacologic approaches. Similarly to humans, lupus-prone MRL/lpr and NZM2328 mice are characterized by enhanced NET formation and by the presence of serum antibodies directed at NET components. When PAD activity was specifically inhibited by in-vivo administration of the PAD inhibitors Cl-amidine or BB-Cl-amidine in lupusprone mouse models, there was significant improvement in tissue inflammation (skin and kidneys), IFN-I responses and vascular damage [61 &amp;&amp; ,62]. In

addition, NET inhibition can have vasculoprotective roles, as the use of Cl-amidine in atherosclerosis-prone mouse models decreased plaque formation and abrogated IFN-I responses in the arterial plaque [63 &amp;&amp; ]. Overall, these observations suggest that targeting PAD4 may be a useful therapeutic target in SLE and future studies should determine their potential role in human disease.

Antimalarials are commonly used to treat SLE and may have vasculoprotective roles; however, their exact mechanism of action in this disease remains to be fully characterized [64]. Chloroquine was recently found to inhibit NET formation in vitro [39 &amp;&amp; ]. Furthermore, calcineurin inhibitors such as cyclosporine A may also modulate NET formation through changes in calcium fluxes [65]. How other immunomodulatory drugs regulate NETosis is the subject of investigation by various groups.

## Mechanisms of neutrophil extracellular trap induced vascular damage in systemic lupus erythematosus

Recent studies [19,66-68] implicate aberrant NET formation in the induction of endothelial damage and thrombosis enhancement. SLE LDG NETs externalize enhanced levels of MMP-9 that activates endothelial MMP-2, in turn inducing an endothelial cell apoptosis process. Inhibition of this MMPassociated pathway in NETs can restore endothelial function and limit vascular toxicity. Moreover, immunogenic complexes composed of MMP-9anti-MMP-9 were identified in SLE as promoters of NET formation and further amplification of a deleterious vasculopathic cycle [69 &amp;&amp; ].

Hyperacetylated histones externalized in NETs can enhance macrophage activation [34]. As an additional proatherogenic mechanism, active oxidative enzymes (including MPO, nitric oxide synthase and NOX) externalized in NETs can modify high-density lipoprotein (HDL) so that it loses its anti-inflammatory, vasoprotective effects and impairs its ability to mediate reverse cholesterol transport [39 &amp;&amp; ]. Indeed, lupus-prone mice that receive in-vivo administration of the PAD inhibitor Cl-amidine and undergo suppression of NET formation display significantly lower levels of oxidized proinflammatory HDL [39 &amp;&amp; ,62]. As a significant proportion of SLE patients display proinflammatory forms of HDL, NETosis may be a key mechanism implicated in this proatherogenic lipoprotein modification in lupus [70].

## CONCLUSION

Over the last year, several reports support the notion that abnormal neutrophil subsets and enhanced NET formation in SLE may play important roles in promoting innate and adaptive aberrant autoimmunity and tissue damage in SLE (Fig. 1). As such, it will be important to further explore potential targets within neutrophil-related responses that could prove beneficial in this disease. In addition, further understanding of the role of NETosis in lupus pathogenesis may allow a new examination of the mechanisms by which drugs previously found to be effective in SLE can have protective effects.
