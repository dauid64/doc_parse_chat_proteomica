Modulation of neutrophil recruitment and function is crucial for targeting in /uniFB02 ammatory cells to sites of infection to combat invading pathogens while, at the same time, limiting host tissue injury or autoimmunity. The underlying mechanisms regulating recruitment of neutrophils, 1 of the most abundant in /uniFB02 ammatory cells, have gained increasing interest over the years. The previously described classical recruitment cascade of leukocytes has been extended to include capturing, rolling, adhesion, crawling, and transmigration, as well as a reversetransmigration step that is crucial for balancing immune defense and control of remote organ endothelial leakage. Current developments in the /uniFB01 eld emphasize the importance of cellular interplay, tissue environmental

cues, circadian rhythmicity, detection of neutrophil phenotypes, differential chemokine sensing, and contribution of distinct signaling components to receptor activation and integrin conformations. The use of therapeutics modulating neutrophil activation responses, as well as mutations causing dysfunctional neutrophil receptors and impaired signaling cascades, have been de /uniFB01 ned in translational animal models. Human correlates of such mutations result in increased susceptibility to infections or organ damage. This review focuses on current advances in the understanding of the regulation of neutrophil recruitment and functionality and translational implications of current discoveries in the /uniFB01 eld with a focus on acute in /uniFB02 ammation and sepsis.

## Introduction

A functioning immune system is crucial to combat invading pathogens. Nonetheless, uncontrolled activation and in /uniFB01 ltration of immune cells can lead to organ damage, placing the host in danger. Clinical manifestations of or disease associated with such uncontrolled immune reactions include glomerulonephritis, vaso-occlusion -related pain crises in sickle cell disease, ischemia reperfusion damage, acute kidney injury, hepatic steatosis, and septic shock. Sepsis is associated with a high mortality and involves uncontrolled immune cell in /uniFB01 ltration and activation, edema formation, tissue damage, and organ dysfunction. 1,2 Consequently, understanding the individual regulatory steps, as well as speci /uniFB01 c recruitment and activation cues of immune cells in varying tissues and in /uniFB02 ammatory settings, is a prerequisite to developing potential therapeutic approaches.

Leukocytes consist of different cell populations, including granulocytes (neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils), monocytes, and T and B lymphocytes, each ful /uniFB01 lling distinct immunologic functions. Neutrophils, the most abundant leukocyte, reach the in /uniFB02 ammatory site in a cascade-like manner, leading to activation of speci /uniFB01 c effector functions, such as release of reactive oxygen species, degranulation, formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), and phagocytosis. 3-6 Imbalance in the number, recruitment, or functionality of neutrophils during this process

results in clinical maladies presenting with uncontrolled infections, immunopathology, or autoimmunity.

## Traditional steps of the leukocyte recruitment cascade: a basic understanding

Effector-based functionality requires precise targeting of neutrophils to the site of infection. This process relies on differentially regulated steps, discovered by various pioneers in the /uniFB01 eld, 7-14 which can be described in a simpli /uniFB01 ed cascade-like manner, resulting in successful organ in /uniFB01 ltration.

Capturing and rolling Neutrophils are free/uniFB02 owing cells within the blood stream. Localized targeting toward the vessel wall and transient interactions manifest via rheologicand deformabilitydependent margination, followed by capturing. 15,16 Capturing (or tethering) itself can be separated into 2 independent, but closely related, steps: the primary capture, implying direct neutrophilendothelial interaction, and secondary L-selectin mediated capturing, -in which neutrophils interact with already rolling leukocytes or leukocytic fragments. 17 Subsequently, the neutrophil engages in a constant slower interaction termed ' rolling ' (Figure 1). Although fast rolling is crucially reliant on endothelial and/or platelet P-selectin, slow rolling relies on endothelial-expressed E-selectin. 18-21 Rolling involves sialyl-Lewis X and the neutrophil-expressed glycosylationdependent 22,23 receptor P-selectin glycoprotein ligand 1 (PSGL-1), which, following binding to E- or P-selectin, can induce an integrin

Figure 1. Updated leukocyte recruitment cascade and translational implications. Free/uniFB02 owing neutrophils are captured by transient PSGL-1 selectin -and VLA4 VCAM/VLA-6 laminin interactions. Rolling (fast: P-selectin; --slow: E-selectin) is impacted by PSGL-1 and ESL-1 binding to their selectin partners, as well as CD44, which, in a lipid raft and Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK)-dependent manner, affects E-selectin -mediated slow rolling. Chemokine-mediated full activation of LFA-1 leads to ICAM-1 dependent -/uniFB01 rm neutrophil adhesion. This adhesive bond is further strengthened by Mac-1 interactions. Signaling elements and recruitment cues involved in integrin activation include talin-1 and kindlin-3. The subsequent slower crawling toward endothelial access points is primarily controlled by CXCL-1, whereas the transmigration toward the abluminal side is CXCL 2 dependent, followed by another step of abluminal CXCL-1 -dependent crawling. Neutrophil transmigration depends on pore size selection and is additionally facilitated by mast cell -derived tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Neutrophils exert their functions within the tissue but are capable of reentering the blood circulation (reverse transmigration) in a Mac-1, neutrophil elastase, LTB-4, JAM-C -dependent pathway, taking on an activated phenotype.

## Steps of the recruitment cascade:

## Translational considerations:

- 1. Free flow
- 2. Margination and capturing
- 3. Tethering/sling formation: high shear; adhesive bonds due to PSGL-1/LFA-1 rich regions
- 4. Rolling: Selectins (fast: P , slow: E); PSGL-1; Sialyl Lewis x ; Actin polymerization; Myo1F
- 5. Adhesion: Chemokine signaling; integrin activation (-&gt; LFA-1, VLA4, VLA6); integrin regulators: Kindlin, Talin, Rap, RIAM, ILK, PKC and: Adhesion strengthening: Chemokine signaling; integrins (Mac1); signaling components: ArhGap15, WASp, ERM proteins, SRC kinase family

- d. Tether/sling rupture under septic conditions: S100 A8/A9 release
- e. LAD type III

Figure 2. Regulators of neutrophil traf /uniFB01 cking. (A) Integrin activation is distinctly regulated. Selectin engagement results in the intermediate conformation of the integrin, which requires talin-1 binding to the integrin cytoplasmic tail. The high-af /uniFB01 nity conformation requires the presence of talin-1 and kindlin-3. Talin-1 binding relies on formation of a complex with Rap1 and RIAM, whereas kindlin-3 is recruited to the integrin prior to induction of the high-af /uniFB01 nity conformation and transmits its activation signal toward LFA-1 in an ILK, PKC, and pH-domain -dependent manner. Mechanistic differences between LFA-1 and Mac-1 exist in that Mac-1 activation depends on ArhGAP15 and Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK). LRP1 can bind via the I domain to Mac-1 and to a lesser extent to LFA-1. (B) Reverse-transmigrated neutrophils can recirculate and impact leakage even at remote organs, such as the lung. The lung-resident marginated pool of neutrophils undergoes fast Abl kinase -dependent phenotypic changes upon LPS challenge to prime the cells for bacterial ' hunting. ' 85 Overall, neutrophils exert effects within different tissues but are equally impacted and modulated by their surroundings. (C) Circadian rhythms dictate leukocyte release, function and clearance, impacting and modulating many subsequent activation and recruitment mechanisms. (D) Neutrophils interact with endothelial cells, which mediates recruitment and activation. Interaction with platelets helps in activation, priming, and recruitment to in /uniFB02 amed or injured tissue but also occurs during thrombus formation. Interaction of neutrophils with regulatory T cells (Treg) evokes interleukin-10 (IL-10) release by neutrophils. Neutrophil-erythrocyte interaction is prominent in sickle cell disease. Additionally, erythrocytes contain a variety of cytokines that can impact neutrophil functionality.

Figure 3. Translational considerations. (A) An adequate assessment of neutrophils present, the degree and necessity of in /uniFB02 ammatory reactions, and evaluation of possible therapeutics must be performed. (B) Leukocyte dysfunction is observable in genetic diseases. Leukocyte adhesion de /uniFB01 ciencies result in an increased risk for infections due to different underlying causes. Also, other causes affecting neutrophils are known, including transfusion, extracorporeal circulation, and in /uniFB02 ammatory diseases. Patients require isolation and immunoprotective measures or adequate control of neutrophil hyperactivation and organ-protection strategies. (C) COVID19 based considerations must take neutrophil phenotypes into account. Anti-in -/uniFB02 ammatory strategies are being discussed, but more precise interventions are needed. Distinguishing between the acute and long phases of COVID are important. Targeted approaches seem to be promising for future endeavors in the therapy of COVID, sepsis, or acute respiratory distress syndrome. (D) Consideration of circadian rhythmicity is crucial for future therapeutic endeavors. Rescheduling of surgeries or interventions is needed, and chronotherapy, light therapy, and sleep interventions are in place.

conformational change from low to intermediate or even high af /uniFB01 nity. 24,25 PSGL-1 is linked to the actin cytoskeleton, which facilitates actin polymerization changes needed for slow rolling. Indeed, defects in the polymerization of the actin cytoskeleton have been described that result in inadequate, ' intermittent rolling. ' 26,27 When observing rolling leukocytes at very high shear rates, small membrane formations, termed ' tethers ' (at the rear) and ' slings ' (at the front), that increase the membrane adhesive area could be observed. Membrane slings feature patches of high PSGL-1 expression, together with leukocyte function antigen 1 (LFA-1) that serves as an adhesive substrate, allowing rolling even at high shear rates. 28 Notably, although tethers appear to engage in more stable interactions, at very high shear rates, such as during septic conditions, they rupture from

neutrophils, forming so-called S100A8/A9-rich ' elongated neutrophil-derived structures. ' 29 These structures release S100A8/A9 into the environment, depending on calcium levels, which may actively promote the in /uniFB02 ammatory milieu at the endothelial surface.

Integrin activation and adhesion Rolling and deceleration of the cell lead to successful interaction of chemokine receptors, such as CXCR-2 and formyl peptide receptors, with their ligands presented on the endothelium. 30 This evokes a multistep signaling response that results in the conformational change of integrins and allowing for shear-resisting cellular adhesion. 14,31 Integrins are heterodimers consisting of an a subunit and a b subunit. The most prominent class of neutrophil-expressed

integrins is the b 2-integrins, of which they express 4 (LFA-1, Mac-1, CR4, and a b D 2) to varying degrees. 32-34 To our knowledge, integrins can exist in 4 conformations, ranging from inactive (bent-closed) to fully active (open). All of the G-protein -coupled receptor (inside-out signaling) -mediated integrin activation cascades commonly result in the recruitment of integrin regulators, including talin-1 and kindlin-3, to the cytoplasmic b tail of the LFA-1 integrin, with differential involvement of other integrin modulators, such as Rap1, RIAM, ILK, and PKC (Figure 2A). 35-38 This successful chemokinemediated full activation results in the high-af /uniFB01 nity conformation of the integrin. The high-af /uniFB01 nity conformation of LFA-1 interacts with its endothelial ligand ICAM-1, which stops slow rolling and arrests the neutrophil on the endothelial surface. 39 In addition to the b 2-integrin LFA-1, the b 1-integrins very late antigen 6 (VLA-6; binding to laminins) and VLA-4 (binding to VCAM-1) have been implicated in neutrophil adhesion. 40-42 This adhesion is strengthened by interaction of the neutrophilic integrin Mac-1 with ICAM-1, a step that is impacted by signaling components Wiskott-Aldrich-syndrome protein (WASp) and ArhGAP15. 43,44

Crawling, transmigration, and abluminal crawling Neutrophil adhesion is followed by slower movement along the endothelium termed ' crawling, ' which can be in the direction of or against the blood /uniFB02 ow. Crawling relies on delicate activationdeactivation steps of integrins, integrin-activation pathway modulators, 43 and actin /uniFB02 ow dynamics. 45 Mac-1 is the major regulator of intravascular crawling on ICAM-1 in the microvasculature. 46 However, neutrophil crawling on primary mouse brain microvascular endothelial cells is regulated by LFA-1 and Mac-1 recognizing the ligands ICAM-1 and ICAM-2, hinting toward organ-speci /uniFB01 c differences in recruitment patterns. 6,47 Following the active search of neutrophils for extravasation sites, diapedesis can occur in a transjunctional (paracellular) or a transcellular fashion. Paracellular diapedesis is the favored route for exit of leukocytes from the vasculature. During this process, neutrophils exert mechanical forces on vascular endothelial cells, resulting in opening of junctional gaps, followed by invasive thrusting of the neutrophil into the abluminal space. 48 This process is enhanced by in ammatory signals, facilitating /uniFB02 endothelial cell contractility, which allows leukocytes to pass. 48 Interestingly, mast cell -derived tissue factor as an in /uniFB02 ammatory

signaling component also contributes to the ef /uniFB01 cient extravasation of neutrophils in different models, such as hypersensitivityinduced skin in /uniFB02 ammation or lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-triggered in /uniFB02 ammation. 49 Overall, neutrophils seem to favor the route of least resistance in their extravasation, because they probe the surrounding surface for large pores to engage in repositioning. 50 In addition to these biomechanics cues, crawling and transmigration are differentially affected by a chemokine-milieu of CXCL-1 and CXCL-2, in that CXCL-1 is the major regulator of intravascular and subluminal crawling, whereas CXCL-2 and ACKR1 mediate transmigration. 51 Transmigration is followed by an abluminal crawling step, which can be regarded as another cascade-like series of events ultimately resulting in full tissue invasion, once the basement membrane and pericyte layer are breached. 52

Reverse migration Notably, the previously described 1-way route of extravasation is also accessible in an abluminal-to-luminal direction, because neutrophils are capable of re-entering the bloodstream in a process termed ' reverse transendothelial migration ' (rTEM). 53 This process is driven by LTB4, neutrophil elastase, and Mac-1, which together lead to the proteolytic cleavage of JAM-C, allowing neutrophils to re-enter the bloodstream. 54,55 Further regulatory factors involve activation of the hypoxic factor 1 a subunit as a negative regulator and coldinducible RNA-binding protein as a positive regulator of rTEM of neutrophils. 56,57 The reverse migratory step is crucially dependent on chemokine gradients, because de /uniFB01 ciency of the chemokine receptor CXCR2 reduces neutrophil rTEM. 58 Overall, rTEM results in neutrophil phenotype switching toward an activated morphology. 59 Reverse transmigrated neutrophils may lodge in remote organs, such as the lung, leading to vascular leaks at sites distant from the original in /uniFB02 ammatory injury (Figure 2B). 60 Notably, in zebra /uniFB01 sh, reverse transmigration also occurs during wound healing, which is at least partially dependent on the presence of macrophages that mediate the resolution of neutrophil in /uniFB01 ltration. 61,62 Neutrophil reverse migration has been regarded as a cornerstone of resolution of in /uniFB02 ammation in wound healing. 63 Therefore, these /uniFB01 ndings could imply that lodging of preactivated neutrophils in remote organs is the unwanted consequence of ongoing/uncontrolled resolution processes, including reverse migration, at sites of in /uniFB02 ammation. 62 Because neutrophils need to access the circulatory system to return to the circulation, tissue-disrupting factors must be considered. Indeed, in a model of sterile hepatic wounding in the mouse, although neutrophil primary extravasation was not impacted by the absence of cathepsin C, neutrophil reverse transmigration crucially depended on serine protease activity, affecting organ revascularization. 64 Notably, reverse transmigration also occurs in other leukocyte subsets, such as monocytes, and has been linked to phenotypic differences in mature dendritic cells (reverse migrated) compared with macrophages (remaining and not engaging in rTEM). 65

Tissue migration Once the neutrophil has breached the basement membrane barrier to enter the interstitium, it engages in a different ' amoeboid ' form of migration that requires cellular deformation, actin polymerization, and structural tissue reorganization. 66 The mechanisms regulating amoeboid interstitial migration are distinct from those controlling intravascular adhesion/ migration. For example, de /uniFB01 ciency in the unconventional class I myosin 1f does not affect migration along 2-dimensional

surfaces, such as endothelial crawling, but it does block successful migration of neutrophils in 3-dimensional collagen networks. 67 During interstitial migration, neutrophils release proteases to degrade matrix elements while also repositioning their nucleus, propelling themselves forward through distinct collagen network pores. 68 In contrast to 2-dimensional intraluminal crawling in which serine proteinases control cell surface adhesion molecules (eg, CD44), matrix metalloproteinases play the dominant role in tissue remodeling during interstitial migration. 66 Nonetheless, the migration of neutrophils in interstitial tissue can also occur in a protease-independent fashion via persistent rearward polarization of F-actin. 69

Effector functions Once neutrophils are recruited to the site of infection, combatting of invading pathogens is required. For this purpose, the neutrophil is equipped with a repertoire of effector functions, such as phagocytosis, NETosis, reactive oxygen species production, and granule secretion. These effector functions can be induced by transmigration of neutrophils, in which they take on a preactivated phenotype. 70,71 Regulators of integrin signaling (eg, Src kinase-associated phosphoprotein 2) that modulate inside-out integrin activation equally affect outside-in signaling responses (eg, phagocytosis of bacterial particles), emphasizing the dual contribution of integrins and integrin regulators to recruitment and effector functions. 72 As another signaling element, calcium shuttling plays a major role in ef /uniFB01 cient phagocytosis, because absence of the calcium sensor STIM1 signi /uniFB01 cantly decreases the phagocytosis of Staphylococcus aureus particles. 73 A rather surprising observation is the effect of L-selectin shedding, which occurs regularly during neutrophil activation, on outside-in -mediated effector functions. Herein, ADAMTS17 based L-selectin shedding enhances phagocytosis, bacterial clearance, and tissue navigation of neutrophils in infected tissue. 74

In addition to this direct ' eating ' response toward bacterial particles, another effector component, NETs, is needed to combat and trap invading pathogens, as demonstrated by the use of a novel monoclonal antibody that protects NETs from degradation and which enhances outcome in preclinical sepsis models. 75 Also, sterile in /uniFB02 ammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, liver injury, and kidney damage, are impacted by NETs, because excessive NETosis can result in organ damage. 76-78

## Overarching factors influencing neutrophil functionality and inflammation

## Organ-specific properties and neutrophil pools

Organ-speci /uniFB01 c recruitment patterns of neutrophils have been uncovered over the years. 79-82 Different organs exhibit distinct rheologic, cellular, and receptor properties. For example, the lung and liver feature the recently identi /uniFB01 ed receptor dipeptidase-1, which impacts leukocyte sequestration and the outcome of endotoxemia-related pulmonary in /uniFB02 ammation. 83 Interestingly, the kidney also features distinct recruitment patterns, because the recruitment of neutrophils to the glomerulus does not involve prior rolling of neutrophils but immediate arrest due to platelet -Pselectin. 84 It is tempting to speculate about possible therapeutics that are capable of blocking the organ-speci /uniFB01 c receptors responsible for neutrophil in /uniFB01 ltration, which would allow for directed

targeting of these in /uniFB02 ammatory cells to a site of infection, away from, for example, ischemia-reperfusion -injured organs. Major sites of neutrophil interaction, such as the lung, are additionally known to feature neutrophil ' pools ' and capillary-based recruitment patterns (Figure 2B). 85 Thus, although neutrophil in /uniFB01 ltration is known to affect organ function, the cell itself is also modulated by its surrounding tissue. Corroborating this notion, Ballesteros et al elegantly demonstrated very recently that neutrophil phenotypes, including longevity, differed according to their target tissues. 86

## Neutrophil heterogeneity and circadian rhythmicity

Originally described as a homogenous population, it is now well accepted that different neutrophil subtypes exist, underscoring the importance of neutrophil heterogeneity for disease-related outcomes. 87 Although the discussion about the origin of these distinct phenotypic features is ongoing, 88 it seems that intrinsic and extrinsic factors contribute to neutrophil diversity. One prominent internal factor is the clock gene Bmal1 (Figure 2C). This factor acts as an internal clock, affecting CXCL2/CXCR2and contrasting CXCR4-dependent processes associated with neutrophil aging and clearance from the circulation. 89 Additionally, external circadian features and tissue-dependent properties affect neutrophils, because clearance from the circulation is impacted by oscillations of interacting molecules, such as P-/Eselectin and VCAM-1, in the bone marrow microvasculature. 90,91 Although circadian rhythms, in general, have long been known, 92,93 and clinical observations highlight the time-of-day variability in in /uniFB02 ammatory-disease presentations, 94-96 therapeutic and clinical approaches (eg, scheduling of surgeries/interventions) incorporating this knowledge remain scarce. 97

## Cellular interplay affecting neutrophils

The interaction of neutrophils with endothelial cells is crucial for activation and recruitment, but other cells also in /uniFB02 uence neutrophil responses. Neutrophils are capable of directly interacting with platelets, megakaryocytes, other leukocytes, tumor cells, and erythrocytes to various degrees, depending on the underlying (disease) model (Figure 2D). 98-101 Although direct erythrocyte-neutrophil interplay occurs primarily in sickle cell disease, platelets are ascribed a more prominent role in the interaction with neutrophils, ' guiding ' them to extravasation sites. 102 Depletion of platelets protects mice from lung injury in a number of models. 103,104 Nonetheless, thrombocytopenia itself is linked to an increased risk for acute respiratory distress syndrome. 105 Also, in the liver, platelets assist in the recruitment of neutrophils to sterile injury sites, a process that is crucial for organ repair. 106 In addition to platelets, neutrophils interact directly with T cells, speci /uniFB01 cally regulatory T cells, which, once stimulated with LPS, provoke the production of interleukin-10 in neutrophils. 107

## Pericytes in the regulation of neutrophil invasion and inflammation

Neutrophil emigration is impacted by endothelial cells, and pericytes are also key contributors to ef /uniFB01 cient neutrophil tissue invasion. 108 It has been known for more than a decade that lowexpression regions/hotspots within the basement membrane are preferred sites for neutrophil emigration. 109 These lowexpression regions are aligned with pericyte gaps and both can

enlarge to a similar extent, controlling neutrophil invasion. 109,110 Neutrophils interact with pericytes in an ICAM-1 dependent -manner by the formation of extensions that lead to interactions with pericyte-based extensions, 111 but con icting reports /uniFB02 exist that question the necessity of neutrophil-interaction for gap enlargement. 110,112 The contractility of pericytes, which has been attributed to the regulation of neutrophil invasion permissiveness, is impacted by endothelial cell -secreted macrophage inhibitory factor, showing the mechanistic interplay of the blood-tissue barrier during neutrophil emigration. 113 Distinct subsets of pericytes, such as NG2 1 pericytes, which can be found in proximity to arterioles and capillaries, show unique expression characteristics, offering in /uniFB02 ammatory sensors, such as tumor necrosis factor receptor, Toll-like receptors, and formyl peptide receptor 2. These pericytes lead to increased migratory velocity and altered invasive characteristics (including regulation of matrix metalloproteinases) of neutrophils by macrophage inhibitory factor and CXCL8. 114 Although pericytes are well recognized for their contribution to the regulation of neutrophil invasion, therapeutic endeavors remain scarce and demand further mechanistic research.

## Translational considerations

For clinicians, understanding the underlying mechanisms of neutrophil recruitment is highly important (Figures 1, 3, and 4). As described above, in /uniFB02 ammation impacts neutrophil activation responses, 115 and the course of in /uniFB02 ammatory conditions relies on neutrophil functionality and neutrophil activation. 116-118 Therapeutic and diagnostic approaches are underway to speci /uniFB01 cally target neutrophils in in /uniFB02 ammatory diseases.

## Targeting the classical recruitment cascade

Selectins Selectins are prominently involved in the primary steps of neutrophil recruitment. From a translational point of view, although preclinical (swine) 119 and clinical data from a pilot study suggested favorable application of an E-selectin antibody in patients with septic shock, 120 primate data using Eand L-selectin antibodies did not reveal any bene /uniFB01 t in lung injury or mortality in a sepsis model. 121 Because involvement of P-selectin in neutrophil-dependent lung injury has long been known, 122 applicability of P-selectin blockage in patients with COVID-19 is being discussed. 123 Nonetheless, the necessity of selectins and selectin ligands for ef /uniFB01 cient immune defense is seen in patients presenting with leukocyte adhesion de /uniFB01 ciency type 2; they show impaired leukocyte rolling due to a fucosylation defect of selectin ligands. 124

Integrin activation and neutrophil adhesion Studies using genetically engineered mice resulting in integrin hyper- or hypoactivation, as well as utilization of blocking antibodies in disease models, demonstrate the involvement of integrin functionality in acute in /uniFB02 ammatory disease models, such as pneumonia, sepsis, and acute kidney injury. 125-129 Overall, blocking or genetic targeting of integrins seems to be promising in animal studies, but it fails to show outcome-relevant effects in humans or results in major adverse events. Studies targeting the Mac-1 and LFA-1 ligand ICAM-1 using an antibody or antisense oligonucleotide yielded negative results in ischemic stroke and steroid-refractory Crohn s ' disease. 130,131 Also, when directly targeting CD18containing integrins, the results for myocardial infarction were

negative, 132 whereas preclinical data for polymicrobial sepsis showed reduced lung damage following antibody blocking of Mac-1 and LFA-1. 126 Nonetheless, causality of therapeutics is dif /uniFB01 cult to determine because of the involvement of various cell populations and the inability to distinguish between the different recruitment steps in which integrins are involved. 133 Notably, various adverse events have been reported in leukocyte-related studies (eg, the ICAM-1 -blocking antibody enlimomab resulted in an increased rate of infections) (Table 1). 130

Crawling and migration Blocking of leukocyte integrins LFA1/Mac-1 or ICAM-1 reduces transendothelial migration similar to the blocking of CXCL-1 or CXCL-2 that results in diminished neutrophil in /uniFB02 ux into the abdominal cavity at early time points in an LPS model. 134,135 Also, human data using a CXCR2 antagonist seems to be promising because it reduces neutrophil in /uniFB02 ux into airways following LPS challenge in healthy volunteers and is under debate for treatment of COVID-19. 136,137 With regard to neutrophils undergoing rTEM, these cells impact vascular leakage at sites distant from the original in /uniFB02 ammatory injury, but clinical targeting of the speci /uniFB01 c cells is not yet possible. 60

Effector functions Priming of neutrophils for anti-infectious purposes, while at the same time limiting host tissue damage, holds great potential for a future in which increasing microbial antibiotic resistance must be considered. Because the integrin Mac-1 is needed for anti-infectious purposes, as well as the prevention of immunopathology, a novel Mac-1 antibody that speci /uniFB01 cally targets the interaction of CD40L with Mac-1 was developed. Animals treated with this antibody show reduced neutrophil recruitment, thus limiting organ damage but preserving antimicrobial functions. 138

## Inborn neutrophil defects

Consequences of neutrophil dysfunction can be observed in patients with speci /uniFB01 c mutations. Genetic mutations affecting neutrophils were summarized recently. 139 Prominent examples are leukocyte adhesion de /uniFB01 ciencies and actinopathies, such as Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome or coronin-1A de /uniFB01 ciency, which result in impressive phenotypes when it comes to neutrophil morphodynamics. 140 Leukocyte adhesion de /uniFB01 ciencies are rare mutations affecting b 2-integrin functionality via mutations within the integrin gene itself (type 1), defects in selectin ligand posttranslational modi cation /uniFB01 (type 2), or mutations within the kindlin-3 gene (type 3). 141 These mutations lead to recurrent infections due to leukocyte recruitment defects. 142-144 Another mutation affecting neutrophil functions is gain-of-function mutations of WASp, which lead to X-linked neutropenia. This disease is associated with neutropenia, and neutrophils show a hyperactivated phenotype with WASp activity uncoupled from its regulation by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. 145

## Consideration of circadian rhythmicity

As stated above, circadian rhythms are fundamental regulators of neutrophil receptor expression, numbers, and tissue homing. Although these /uniFB01 ndings are of great interest for the scienti /uniFB01 c community, neutrophil-related translational endeavors are scarce. Rescheduling of surgeries or therapeutic interventions based on considerations of wanted/unwanted in /uniFB02 ammatory consequences cannot be observed in regular hospital care, although awareness for increased cardiovascular disease risk is

being raised in shift workers, for example. 146 Current endeavors in circadian rhythmicity -related therapies focus on chronotherapy, light therapy, and sleep interventions. 97 Of note, neutrophil in /uniFB02 ammatory responses are affected by circadian rhythms, as well as an in /uniFB02 ammatory trigger itself that leads to reorganization of circadian rhythms in preclinical animal models. 147

## COVID-19

In the past year, clinicians worldwide have been confronted with patients infected by SARS-CoV2. Notably, COVID-19 is associated with massive immunothrombotic dysfunctions. Nicolai et al showed that phenotypic changes in neutrophils correlate with disease severity. 148 Additionally, immature band neutrophils can be found in the blood of critically ill patients with COVID-19. 149 Although the observed neutrophil characteristics were rather speci /uniFB01 c for severe COVID-19 cases, it is possible that multipanel assessment of neutrophils might aid in diagnosing and selecting patients for appropriate treatments in other disease settings as well. 150 In this direction, screening for deformability of neutrophils in COVID-19 and long-COVID-19 patients revealed disturbed biomechanics properties with diagnostic implications. 151 Different anti-in /uniFB02 ammatory strategies have been proposed by researchers and clinicians, such as studying the effects of tumor necrosis factor blockade 152 or blocking neutrophil NET formation in the lung. 153 Not all anti-in /uniFB02 ammatory approaches have worked, possibly also as a result of unspeci /uniFB01 city (Table 1).

## Outlook

Current research endeavors focus on the discovery of novel components in signaling, phenotypic switching, and recruitment of neutrophils with the use of multi-omics and next-generation sequencing. Furthermore, available data on clinical trials highlight that a vast number of studies concentrate on better phenotyping of patients, neutrophil subsets, and disease subclasses (eg, sepsis). For the keyword ' neutrophil, ' clinicaltrials.gov lists 2618 completed studies and 800 recruiting studies (last updated on 20 June 2021). The underlying topics are diverse, ranging from NET formation in systemic sclerosis (NCT03374618) to neutrophil phenotypic pro ling /uniFB01 in various patients, such as those with diabetes (NCT02080741), patients postsurgery (NCT03058328), and patients experiencing cardiovascular events (NCT04581057) or sepsis (NCT04103268, NCT02803346). Inhibitor studies include research on neutrophil elastase inhibition in bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (NCT02669251), as well as a granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor inhibitor (otilimab) in patients with arthritis (NCT04134728). Additionally, routinely available interventions that include diet or physical activity are being assessed for their implications in in /uniFB02 ammation and neutrophil recruitment. Novel applications for in-use medications (eg, methotrexate) are being studied, and new drugs are being put to the test. In this sense, development of more speci c /uniFB01 integrin modulators that avoid exerting unintended agonistic signaling are on the way. 154 A tremendous boost in translational in /uniFB02 ammatory studies has occurred as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. These /uniFB01 ndings are a big step toward the next level of neutrophil research in which phenotyping will lead to a personalized targeted therapy, also taking into account circadian (dys)regulations and allowing the precise directing of each in /uniFB02 ammatory cell to the infected site away from uninvolved

tissues. 155,156 Additionally, targeted on-off switching of effector functions will help in preventing immunopathology to improve organ function.

## Summary and conclusions

In summary, the recruitment of neutrophils relies on a distinct multifactorial sequence of events that requires selectins, integrins, accessible ligands, appropriate chemokine milieus, cell-cell interactions, and different signaling cascades in the cells. Current evidence shows that the previously reported 1-way street of leukocyte recruitment is, in fact, a 2-way road by which neutrophils can reenter the circulation and cause organ damage, even at a remote location in the body. The regulation of each step for the successful in /uniFB01 ltration of neutrophils is crucially impacted by integrin interactors and chemokine gradients. Recruitment, numbers, and phenotypes of neutrophils are affected by circulating chemokines and cytokines, and consumption, reproduction, and mobilization of neutrophil pools also must be considered when interpreting the full magnitude of circulating neutrophil populations. Thus, it appears that we are still on the brink of understanding the complex interplay of in /uniFB02 ammation, stressors, resolution, and the variety of functions that neutrophils exert. Thus, future research is needed to optimize diagnostic options for neutrophil subpopulations, and large randomized controlled trials are crucially needed to address immunomodulatory therapeutics that are individualized for speci /uniFB01 c patient subsets.
