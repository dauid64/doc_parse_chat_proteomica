Background: Airway remodeling may play an important role in asthma pathophysiology. Transforming growth factor β (TGF- ) β has a critical role in the remodeling process. Although cellular sources for TGFβ have been previously investigated in asthma airways, the expression, release, or both of TGFβ from asthmatic airways and blood neutrophils has not been reported. Objective: The current study evaluated the TGFβ protein and messenger (m)RNA expression by airway and peripheral blood neutrophils in asthmatic and normal subjects. β

Methods: TGFprotein expression by airway and peripheral blood neutrophils was detected by using immunocytochemistry. TGFβ protein levels in blood neutrophil supernatant were measured by using an enzyme immunoassay. TGFβ mRNA expression was evaluated by using reverse transcription-PCR. Results: Higher numbers of TGFβ + cells and neutrophils were found in airway tissue of asthmatic (n = 15) compared with normal subjects (n = 10). Although neutrophils in both asthmatic and normal airway tissue expressed TGFβ protein and the percentage of neutrophils expressing TGFβ was similar between the two groups, the total number of TGFβ + neutrophils was higher in the asthmatic subjects ( P = .01). Peripheral blood neutrophils from asthmatic (n = 5) and normal subjects (n = 7) also expressed TGFβ protein and mRNA. Blood neutrophils from asthmatic subjects spontaneously released significantly higher levels of TGFβ than those from normal subjects ( P = .007). Conclusion: These data suggest that airway and blood neutrophils from both asthmatic and normal subjects can express and release TGFβ . Higher levels of TGFβ expression-release from asthmatic neutrophils indicate that neutrophils may be involved in the airway remodeling process of asthmatic subjects.

matory and fibrotic processes. It can act as an immunomodulator, having both inductive and suppressive effects on inflammation and the immune response. Made up of 3 isoforms (TGFβ 1,2,3), it has also been demonstrated to play an important role in tissue repair and fibrosis. 1

Chronic  airway  inflammation  and  the  associated remodeling process, in particular subepithelial fibrosis, are  likely  to  contribute  to  the  pathogenesis  of  asthma. 2 Airway  inflammation  in  asthma  has  classically  been characterized by a mucosal  infiltrate of T cells, eosinophils, and perhaps mast cells. However, recent studies  have  also  demonstrated  that  neutrophils  are increased  in  the  airways  of  asthmatic  subjects  with severe and near-fatal disease. 3,4 The mechanisms and importance of this neutrophilic infiltrate in the pathophysiologic processes of asthma are not yet clear.

TGFβ expression  has  also  been  reported  to  be increased in asthmatic subjects with more severe disease. 5-7 Interestingly, TGFβ is  believed  to  both  recruit and activate neutrophils. In vitro, it is 150,000 times more  potent  than  fMet-Leu-Phe, making  it  the  most potent chemoattractant for neutrophils yet described. 8 It can  also  prolong  neutrophil  survival. 9,10 In  addition, TGFβ protein and messenger (m)RNA may correlate with the thickness of subepithelial basement membrane (as an indicator of airway fibrosis). 6,7 The cellular source or sources of TGFβ in these studies have been ascribed primarily to bronchial epithelial cells and inflammatory cells, especially eosinophils. 6,7

Although neutrophils have been described to produce other cytokines, such as TNFα , IL-1 β , IL-3, IL-6, IL-8, and GM-CSF, 11 the  ability  of  neutrophils  to  produce TGFβ has not been well studied. Although peripheral blood neutrophils were previously shown to constitutively release TGFβ , 12 no further studies have investigated the  expression, release, and/or control of TGFβ from airway tissue neutrophils in either a normal or disease state, such as asthma.

This  study  examined  whether  airway  neutrophils expressed  TGFβ and  whether  the  neutrophil  TGFβ expression level differed between asthmatic and normal control subjects. TGFβ expression (both protein and mRNA) was also compared in peripheral blood neutrophils between asthmatic and normal control subjects.

## METHODS Subjects

All asthmatic subjects met the American Thoracic Society criteria for asthma. Among the 15 asthmatic subjects, 6 were classified as having mild disease, 2 as having moderate disease, and 7 as having severe disease. Subjects with mild asthma were defined as patients with an FEV 1 of greater than 80% of the predicted value while receiving β -agonist treatment alone as needed. Subjects with moderate asthma had an FEV 1 of less than 80% of the predicted value, were receiving β -agonists and inhaled steroids or theophylline, and did not have a history of urgent health care or oral steroid use. Subjects with severe asthma  were  patients  referred  to  our  institute  for  severe  oral steroid-dependent asthma with frequent hospitalization and emergency department visits. This group has been shown in previous studies to have a higher number of airway tissue neutrophils than subjects with milder asthma and normal control subjects. 3,13 Normal control subjects (n = 10) had no history of respiratory diseases and were taking no medications. The protocol was approved by the institutional review board, and all subjects gave informed consent.

## Biopsy tissue processing and immunostaining

Endobronchial biopsy specimens were obtained from 10 normal control subjects and 15 asthmatic subjects. Bronchoscopies were performed as previously described. 3,5 Two to 4 endobronchial biopsy specimens were obtained from each subject. Biopsy specimens were fixed in acetone and embedded in glycol methacrylate resin.  Serial  sections  at  2 µ m were cut from well-oriented tissue blocks. A 3-step indirect immunostaining method was performed as  previously  reported. 5 Two serial tissue sections were stained with monoclonal mouse antibodies against human TGFβ 1,2,3 (30 µ g/mL; Genzyme, Cambridge, Mass) and neutrophil elastase (0.7 µ g/mL; Dako, Carpinteria, Calif). In addition, tissue eosinophils were identified by using a monoclonal mouse antibody specific for eosinophil cationic protein (EG2, 0.5 µ g/mL; Kabi Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden). Control slides were similarly treated but with the  primary  antibodies  replaced  by  nonimmune mouse serum or TRIS-buffered saline.

To colocalize neutrophils that were positive for TGFβ in the submucosa of 2 consecutive tissue sections, a video camera connected to a computer was used to overlay the microscopic image of one section  onto  the  serial  image. The  images for TGFβ and neutrophil staining were then aligned to each other. The cell count was performed at 400 × magnification in the submucosa (measured area, 0.5 mm 2 [0.3-0.7 mm 2 ]), excluding blood vessels, mucous glands, and smooth muscle cells, for cells positive for TGFβ only, neutrophils only, and then for cells that were positive for both TGFβ and neutrophil elastase. The results of the cell count were expressed as follows: (1) the number of cells positive for TGFβ (neutrophils or cell types positive for both TGFβ and neutrophil elastase per square millimeter of submucosa); (2) the number of cells positive for both TGFβ and neutrophil elastase divided by the total number of cells positive for neutrophil elastase (percentage of neutrophils positive for TGFβ ); and (3) the number of cells positive for both TGFβ and neutrophil elastase divided by the total number of cells positive for TGFβ (TGFβ + neutrophils as a percentage of all TGFβ + cells).

## Peripheral blood samples

The second part of the study evaluated the TGFβ expression from peripheral blood neutrophils. Seven normal control subjects and 5 asthmatic subjects (2 with mild and 3 with moderate disease) participated in this portion of the study.

## Peripheral blood neutrophil isolation and processing

Peripheral blood neutrophils were isolated from 40 mL of whole venous blood by using autologous plasma Percol density separation. 14 Four cytospin preparations were made from the isolated neutrophil fraction. Diff-Quick staining, immunocytochemical staining for neutrophil elastase, or both were performed to evaluate the purity  of  neutrophils  (counting  500  cells).  Isolated  neutrophils  were then processed as follows. First, neutrophils were immediately fixed in guanidium isothiocyanate (10 × 10 6 cells/mL) for RNA extraction and saved at -80¡C to avoid potential mRNA degradation. Second, neutrophils were incubated in 4-chamber permanox tissue-culture slides (4 × 10 6 cells/chamber) or in 24-well tissue-culture plates (2 × 10 6 cells/well) for 6 hours with and without LPS (1 µ g/mL) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 0.1% BSA. The culture medium was collected at 6 hours and centrifuged, and the supernatant was stored at -80¡C for TGFβ measurement. Third, neutrophils were fixed in acetone and embedded in glycol methacrylate resin (2 × 10 6 cells), as described above. Serial 2µ m sections of the embedded cells were immunostained for TGFβ 1,2,3 (mAb) or for TGFβ 1 (rabbit polyclonal antibody recognizing human TGFβ 1 epitope mapping at the C-terminus, 5 µ g/mL; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc, Santa Cruz, Calif). Positively stained cells were counted, and the results were expressed as TGFβ + cells divided by total cells (%). At least 300 cells were counted.

## Confocal microscopy

To further confirm the colocalization of neutrophil elastase and TGF- 1 in neutrophils, double immunofluorescent staining was perβ formed in the peripheral blood neutrophil slides from 2 subjects (one normal control and one asthmatic subject). Neutrophil cytospin preparations fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde were incubated with a mixture of a mouse monoclonal neutrophil elastase antibody and a rabbit polyclonal TGFβ 1 antibody, followed by incubation with a mixture of FITC-conjugated anti-mouse and rhodamine-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary  antibodies  (Dako).  Cell  nuclei  were  stained  with  the Hoechst dye 33342. The slides were mounted and observed with a Leica DMR/XA confocal immunofluorescence microscope. Control slides were similarly treated but with the primary antibodies replaced by nonimmune serum or TRIS-buffered saline.

## Enzyme immunoassay

TGF- 1 levels in the supernatant of the cultured peripheral blood β neutrophils were measured by using a sandwich ELISA with a TGFβ 1,2,3  antibody  (Genzyme)  as  a  coating  antibody  and  a biotinylated TGFβ 1 antibody (R&amp;D Diagnostics, Minneapolis, Minn) as a detection antibody. Before the assay, the samples were treated for 1 hour with 1 mol/L HCl to activate latent TGFβ , neutralized with 1 mol/L NaOH, and then diluted with a buffered diluent. The detection range of the assay was 10 to 2000 pg/mL.

## Reverse transcription-PCR

Reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) was performed to detect the expression of TGFβ 1 mRNA in peripheral blood neutrophils. Total cellular RNA was isolated from purified peripheral blood neutrophils by using a microscale RNA isolation kit (5«-3« Prime Inc, Boulder, Colo). Reverse transcription was performed as previously reported. 15,16 After  reverse  transcription, the  complementary

(c)DNA for TGFβ 1  was  amplified  by  PCR  with  the  upstream primer (5« GCC CTG GAC ACC AAC TAT TGC T 3«) and downstream primer (5« AGG CTC CAA ATG TAG GGG CAG G3«; Clontech, Palo Alto, Calif). The cDNA for β -actin was also amplified  as  a  control. The  PCR  reactions  were  carried  out  on  a  DNA Thermal Cycler GeneAmp PCR system 2400 (The Perkin-Elmer Corporation, Norwalk, Conn) for 35 cycles by using the following step cycle: 94¡C for 30 seconds, 60¡C for 30 seconds, and 72¡C for 1  minute.  Aliquots  (20 µ L)  of  the  PCR  products  were  electrophoresed on 1.6% agarose gels, stained with ethidium bromide, and photographed. The specific PCR products for TGFβ 1 and β -actin are 161 and 838 bp, respectively. TGFβ 1 and β -actin bands were quantitated by using densitometry (NIH Image Software; National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md). The TGFβ 1/ β -actin ratio was used to represent TGFβ mRNA expression levels.

## Southern blot analysis

Southern blot analysis 17 was used to confirm the specificity of the TGF- 1 RT-PCR products from neutrophils. Briefly, the TGFβ β 1 RTPCR products (20 µ L) were electrophoresed on 1% agarose gels, denatured, and transferred onto nylon membranes. The transferred membranes were ultraviolet cross-linked, prehybridized, and then hybridized  with  a  5«  end  [ γ 32 P]-adenosine  triphosphate-labeled, TGF- 1-specific, oligonucleotide probe (Clontech). After high-strinβ gency washes, the membranes were exposed to high-performance autoradiography films (Amersham Life Science) for 1 hour at -80¡C.

## In-cell RT -PCR

To localize the TGFβ 1 mRNA expression in peripheral blood neutrophils, in-cell  RT-PCR 15,16 was performed in noncultured blood neutrophils from an asthmatic subject.

Purified neutrophils (0.5 × 10 6 cells per reaction) were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.1 mol/L glycine/0.1% Nonidet P-40 before the RT reaction. After the RT reaction, cDNAs for TGFβ 1 and β -actin were amplified by means of PCR in separate tubes. PCR was performed in a 50µ L reaction mixture of 0.4 µ mol/L of each primer; 50 mmol/L TRIS-HCl (pH 8.3); 15 mmol/L KCl; 0.2 mmol/L deoxyadenosine triphosphate, deoxyguanosine triphosphate, deoxycytidine triphosphate, and deoxythymidine  triphosphate (deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate [dNTP]); 10 µ mol/L digoxigenin11-deoxyuridine triphosphate (Boehringer Mannheim, Indianapolis, Ind); 3 mmol/L MgCl 2 ; and 0.04 U/ µ L Taq DNA polymerase. The negative controls were included with omissions of either specific primers or 4 dNTPs. After PCR, cells were pelleted by centrifuge and rinsed with PBS, and cytospin preparations were made from pelleted cells. The PCR supernatants were saved to detect extracellular TGFβ 1 and β -actin PCR products. The digoxigenin-labeled cDNA for TGF- 1 and β β -actin were detected on neutrophil cytospin preparations by using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antidigoxigenin antibody at 1:500 dilution. A phosphatase-catalyzed color reaction with NBT/BCIP solution (Boehringer Mannheim) produced an insoluble blue-purple precipitate that identified the location of either TGFβ 1 or β -actin.  Some slides were counterstained with Fast Red stain. The remaining slides were not counterstained with Fast Red but were double stained with neutrophil elastase by using immunocytochemistry to colocalize TGFβ 1 mRNA and neutrophils.

## Statistical analyses

Because the data were not normally distributed, data were analyzed by using nonparametric analyses. Comparisons of data were performed by using either the Mann-Whitney U test  for  2-group comparisons  or  the  Kruskal-Wallis  variation  of  the  Wilcoxon signed-rank test for multiple comparisons (JMP software program; SAS Institute, Cary, NC). If the overall P value was less than .05 for multiple comparisons, the Tukey test was then used to confirm dif-

ferences  in  individual  groups.  Correlations  were  performed  by using Spearman rank correlation coefficients. A P value of .05 or less was regarded as significant.

## RESULTS

## Characteristics of subjects

The characteristics of the subjects are given in Table I. In  the  biopsy  study  subjects  with  moderate  and  severe asthma had lower FEV 1 than normal control subjects and subjects with mild asthma. The age was similar among the  3  groups. The duration of asthma was also similar between  the  2  asthmatic  groups, and  they  were  well matched for sex. In the peripheral blood study asthmatic subjects had a lower FEV 1 than normal control subjects. They were matched for age and sex. Asthmatic subjects (n = 5) in the blood study tended to have longer duration of asthma than those (n = 15) in the biopsy study ( P = .08). One normal control and two asthmatic subjects participated in both biopsy and peripheral blood studies.

## TGF- 1,2,3 protein expression by neutrophils β in endobronchial biopsy tissue

Subjects with mild, moderate, and severe asthma were initially analyzed as a single group (n = 15). Asthmatic subjects had significantly higher total numbers of submucosal TGFβ 1,2,3 + cells than normal control subjects (median [interquartile range], 108/mm 2 [50-146 mm 2 ] vs 24/mm 2 [8-50 mm 2 ]; P = .002; Fig 1, A ). Increased numbers of submucosal neutrophils were also seen in asthmatic compared with normal control subjects (127/mm 2 [75-266 mm 2 ] vs 52/mm 2 [36-80 mm 2 ]; P = .01; Fig 1, B ). In contrast to the total numbers of cells, there were no differences in the percentage of neutrophils positive for TGFβ between asthmatic and normal control subjects (median [interquartile range], 29% [19%-46%] vs 20% [0%-39%]; P = .20). Similarly, the percentage of TGFβ + neutrophils as a proportion of all TGFβ + cells also did not differ between the asthmatic and normal control subjects  (53%  [22%-74%]  vs  56%  [0%-70%], P =  .78). However, asthmatic subjects had greater numbers of tissue neutrophils positive for TGFβ than normal control subjects (median [interquartile range], 50/mm 2 [18-80 mm 2 ] vs 9/mm 2 [0-31 mm 2 ]; P = .01; Fig 1, C ), which is likely  because of the higher numbers of both TGFβ + cells and neutrophils.

The effect of asthma severity on neutrophil TGFβ expression was also analyzed. The total number of submucosal TGFβ + cells  in  subjects  with  moderate  and severe asthma (median [interquartile range], 133/mm 2 [42-161 mm 2 ]) was similar to that found in subjects with mild asthma (85/mm 2 [51-124 mm 2 ]) but was significantly higher than that found in the normal control subjects (24/mm 2 [8-50 mm 2 ], overall P = .008). The neutrophil  number  in  the  submucosa  was  significantly higher in subjects with moderate and severe asthma than subjects with mild asthma and normal control subjects (overall P = .008). The percentage of neutrophils positive for TGFβ and the percentage of TGFβ + neutrophils as a proportion of all TGFβ + cells were similar among the

3 groups (overall P = .38 and .74, respectively). The total number of neutrophils positive for TGFβ in  subjects with  moderate  and  severe  asthma  (50/mm 2 [23-105 mm 2 ]) was not significantly different from that found in subjects with mild asthma (36/mm 2 [14-64 mm 2 ]) but

was higher than that found in normal control subjects (9/mm 2 [0-31 mm 2 ], overall P = .03).

An example of neutrophil and TGFβ 1,2,3 staining in 2 consecutive tissue sections is shown in Fig 2. Both neutrophils and TGFβ + cells were mainly localized beneath the subepithelial basement membrane.

TGF- 1,2,3 expression was significantly correlated with β the number of airway neutrophils ( r s = 0.68, P = .002) but not with eosinophils ( r s = 0.27, P = .19). There was a weak but significant inverse correlation ( r s = -0.40, P = .046) between tissue neutrophils positive for TGFβ and FEV 1 percentage in both asthmatic and normal control subjects.

## TGFβ protein expression by peripheral blood neutrophils

The purity of blood neutrophils, as evaluated with Diff-Quick staining, was 95% (interquartile range, 91%97%).  The  contaminating  cells  were  monocytes  and eosinophils. The specificity of Diff-Quick staining was confirmed by neutrophil elastase immunostaining for the neutrophils. The viability of neutrophils, as evaluated by trypan blue staining, before and after a 6-hour incubation with media or LPS was more than 90%.

The percentage of TGFβ 1,2,3 + or TGFβ 1 + cells from freshly isolated blood neutrophil cell sections was similar between asthmatic (n = 5) and normal control subjects (n = 7; 90% [84%-93%] vs 89% [84%-92%], P = .83 for TGF- 1,2,3; 95% [85%-99%] vs 96% [91%-99%], β P = .91 for TGFβ 1). After a 6-hour incubation in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 0.1% BSA, the percentage of TGFβ 1,2,3 + cells remained similar between the asthmatic and normal control subjects (88% [87%-89%] vs 85% [79%-99%], P = .56). However, the percentage of TGFβ 1 + cells tended to be lower in asthmatic subjects compared with normal control subjects (88% [85%-91%] vs 95% [93%-100%], P = .083). Examples of TGFβ staining on isolated neutrophils are shown in Fig 3.

The TGFβ 1 levels in the supernatant of purified neutrophils after a 6-hour incubation in media were higher in asthmatic subjects than in normal control subjects (median [interquartile range], 115 pg/10 6 cells [96-243 pg/10 6 cells] vs 46 pg/10 6 cells [29-72 pg/10 6 cells]; P = .007; Fig 4). A 6-hour incubation with 1 µ g/mL LPS did not change the TGFβ 1 levels in either asthmatic subjects (115 pg/10 6 cells  [96-243 pg/10 6 cells]  vs  128  pg/10 6 cells  [94-231  pg/10 6 cells], P = .83) or normal control subjects  (46  pg/10 6 cells  [29-72  pg/10 6 cells]  vs  41 pg/10 6 cells [24-66 pg/10 6 cells], P = .52).

## Colocalization of TGFβ 1 and neutrophil elastase on peripheral blood neutrophils by means of confocal microscopy

The expression of TGFβ 1 by neutrophils was further confirmed by means of double immunofluorescent staining on noncultured peripheral blood neutrophils with a mixture of  anti-TGFβ 1  and  neutrophil  elastase  antibodies. As shown in Fig 5, both TGFβ 1 and neutrophil elastase staining were seen in the cytoplasmic granules of neutrophils.

## TGF- 1 mRNA expression by peripheral β blood neutrophils

A specific TGFβ 1 PCR band (161 bp) was observed in the TGFβ 1 cDNA template sample supplied by Clon-

ch. Extracted total RNA from purified peripheral neutrophil samples was available from all 7 normal control subjects and 2 of 5 asthmatic subjects at baseline. Expression of TGFβ 1 mRNA, as detected by RT-PCR, was found in 7 of 7 normal control subjects and 2 of 2 asth-ma

ic subjects. The specificity of neutrophil TGFβ 1 RTPCR products was confirmed by means of Southern blot analysis. An example of TGFβ 1 mRNA expression is given in Fig 6. The TGFβ 1/ β -actin ratio in normal control subjects (median, 1.78) appeared to be similar to that seen in the asthmatic subjects (1.79). Because the sample size was small, statistical analysis was not attempted.

Small numbers of contaminating cells, such as monocytes  and  eosinophils, could  have  contributed  to  the TGFβ 1  mRNA expression detected with RT-PCR. Incell  RT-PCR  was  then  used  to  localize  the  TGFβ 1 mRNA signal to neutrophils. More than 90% of cells demonstrated TGFβ 1 mRNA signal. Fig 7, A and C , shows examples of intracellular TGFβ 1  mRNA signal

without  and  with  nuclear  Fast  Red  counterstaining, respectively. No signals were seen in PCR-negative control samples in which specific PCR primers or 4 dNTPs were omitted (Fig 7, B ). Fig 7, D , shows an example of colocalization of TGFβ 1 mRNA and neutrophil elastase staining. As a positive control, β -actin mRNA signal was also observed in neutrophils (Fig 7, E ). Gel electrophoresis also demonstrated specific TGFβ 1 and β -actin PCR products in the in-cell RT-PCR supernatants.

## DISCUSSION

This study demonstrated that neutrophils from both asthmatic and normal airway tissues expressed TGFβ

protein.  In  addition, the  percentage  of  neutrophils expressing TGFβ was similar between the 2 groups. However, because more neutrophils were present in asthmatic airways, the total number of TGFβ + neutrophils was  significantly  higher  in  the  asthmatic  subjects. Peripheral blood neutrophils in both groups  also expressed TGFβ protein and mRNA. Interestingly, after a 6-hour incubation period, supernatants from asthmatic peripheral blood neutrophils released significantly higher levels of TGFβ than those from normal control subjects. These data confirm that airway and blood neutrophils from both asthmatic and normal subjects can express and release TGFβ . The data further suggest that the higher numbers of TGFβ + neutrophils in asthmatic airways may be capable of contributing to the airway remodeling process.

Similar to previous studies, 4,13 asthmatic subjects in the current study had increased numbers of TGFβ + cells and neutrophils in their airways compared with those found in the airways of normal control subjects. However, the percentage of neutrophils positive for TGFβ and the percentage of TGFβ + neutrophils as a proportion of all TGFβ + cells were similar between asthmatic and normal  control  subjects.  The  increased  total  numbers  of TGFβ + neutrophils in asthmatic airways are due to the increased total number of neutrophils. The effect of asthma severity on neutrophil TGFβ expression was also evaluated. Although we previously have reported 2 subtypes of subjects with severe asthma (eosinophil positive and eosinophil negative), neutrophil numbers were not different between the 2 subtypes. 13 Therefore in the cur-

tudy, with a limited sample size, the subjects with severe asthma were not similarly divided. The subjects with moderate and severe asthma tended to have more airway TGFβ + cells, neutrophils, and TGFβ + neutrophils compared with normal control subjects and subjects with mild asthma. However, the percentage of neutrophils positive for TGFβ and the percentage of TGFβ + neutrophils as a proportion of all TGFβ + cells  remained constant among the subjects with different severities of asthma and the normal control subjects. These data suggest that the proportion  of  airway  neutrophil  intracellular  TGFβ expression is not dependent on disease status, severity, or steroid treatment. However, because more neutrophils were seen in asthmatic airways and the number of neutrophils was significantly correlated with TGFβ expression, neutrophils would seem to be able to significantly contribute to local TGFβ expression in asthmatic airways. Our finding that a significant inverse correlation existed between the number of tissue neutrophils positive for TGFβ and FEV 1 percentage would also suggest that neutrophil-derived  TGFβ may play  a  role  in  asthma pathophysiology. Because the focus of the current study was on expression of TGFβ by neutrophils, we cannot exclude the potential role of TGFβ from other airway cells, such as eosinophils, macrophages, mast cells, and bronchial epithelial cells. 18,19

Blood neutrophils from normal subjects have previously been shown to produce and release TGFβ 1. 10,12 The current study extended these observations by comparing blood neutrophil TGFβ expression and release between  normal  and  asthmatic  subjects.  Blood  neu-

ophils  were confirmed to express TGFβ protein and mRNA expression, as demonstrated by RT-PCR, in cell RT-PCR and Southern blot analysis. Similar to the findings in the airways, the percentage of blood neutrophils positive for TGFβ 1,2,3 or TGFβ 1 protein was similar between asthmatic and normal control subjects. TGFβ 1 mRNA expression  level  also  appeared  to  be  similar between the 2 groups. Despite these baseline similarities, after a 6-hour incubation in media alone, there were significantly higher amounts of TGFβ 1 in blood neutrophil supernatants from asthmatic subjects compared with normal subjects. This was associated with a trend toward lower intracellular staining for TGFβ 1 in asthmatic neutrophils at the 6-hour time period. These data suggest that blood  neutrophils  constitutively  produce  and  release TGFβ and  that  asthmatic  blood  neutrophils  may  be more stimulated in vivo, leading to the higher levels of TGFβ release in vitro. This constitutive TGFβ release may partially explain the markedly higher percentage (up to  3  times)  of  neutrophils  positive  for  TGFβ in  the peripheral blood than the smaller percentage of positive cells observed in the airways of either asthmatic or nor-ma

. This lower percentage of TGFβ + tissue neutrophils (compared with peripheral blood), coupled with the greater in vitro release of TGFβ 1 by asthmatic peripheral blood neutrophils, causes one to speculate whether asthmatic tissue neutrophils could be capable of releasing more TGFβ in the tissue than neutrophils from normal control subjects. Further studies are needed to address this issue, but if that is the case, then asthmatic neutrophils could very well be contributing to the fibrotic processes of asthma.

Although the expression of TGFβ mRNA and protein may be induced in macrophages and lymphocytes by some cytokines and cell activators, little is known about the  regulation  of  TGFβ expression  and  activation  in mature neutrophils. TGFβ 1 itself, IL-1, IL-2, IL-7, IL10, phorbol  myristate  acetate  (PMA), and  PHA  are believed to be involved in the regulation of TGFβ mRNA expression  or  protein  release  in  T  cells, B  cells, and macrophages. 20 It  is  likely  that  the  regulation  of  neutrophil TGFβ occurs at multiple levels (eg, transcription, stability of mRNA, translation, storage of latent protein, activation of secreted latent protein, and protein binding

to  the  receptors). 20 TGFβ protein expression has been found in the granules of neutrophilic myelocytes in bone marrow, the precursors of mature peripheral blood neutrophils. 21 This would support a constitutive expression of TGFβ by neutrophils and may explain why about 90% of peripheral blood neutrophils from both asthmatic and normal  control  subjects  expressed  TGFβ in  the  current study. Despite these similarities in intracellular protein expression, higher levels of TGFβ were measured in supernatants from cultured asthmatic neutrophils. Although the mechanism behind these increased levels was not explored in this study, the regulatory controls mentioned above, as well as factors controlling neutrophil degranulation and proteases involved in TGFβ degradation, could all be involved. In this regard neutrophil TGFβ release has been reported to be increased by PMA, a well-known granule secretagogue. 10 LPS activation of human peripheral neutrophils neither increased the level of TGFβ mRNA expression nor the protein release, 12 further supporting the primary regulation of TGFβ in neutrophils at a posttranscriptional-translational level. In the current study the addition of LPS did not appear to upregulate the levels of TGFβ .  However, the effect of other factors, such as TGFβ itself, IL-1, and IL-2 (all of which have been reported to be increased in asthmatic airways or serum), 5-7,22-26 on neutrophil TGFβ expression, release, or both remains to be evaluated.

In  summary, this study identifies the neutrophil as a potentially important source of TGFβ in  the  airways. Further studies are required to evaluate the regulation, activation, or both of neutrophil TGFβ expression in asthmatic subjects. These studies should help to further identify the involvement of neutrophil-derived TGFβ in asthmatic inflammatory and remodeling processes.
