Transected axons typically fail to regenerate in the central nervous system (CNS), resulting in chronic neurological disability in individuals with traumatic brain or spinal cord injury, glaucoma and ischemia-reperfusion injury of the eye. Although neuroinflammation is often depicted as detrimental, there is growing evidence that alternatively activated, reparative leukocyte subsets and their products can be deployed to improve neurological outcomes. In the current study, we identify a unique granulocyte subset, with characteristics of an immature neutrophil, that had neuroprotective properties and drove CNS axon regeneration in vivo, in part via secretion of a cocktail of growth factors. This pro-regenerative neutrophil promoted repair in the optic nerve and spinal cord, demonstrating its relevance across CNS compartments and neuronal populations. Our findings could ultimately lead to the development of new immunotherapies that reverse CNS damage and restore lost neurological function across a spectrum of diseases.

A xonal  transection  and  neuronal  death  are  pathological features of a wide range of CNS disorders, including traumatic brain or spinal cord injury (SCI), multiple sclerosis and  motor  neuron  disease.  They  are  also  hallmarks  of  glaucoma and ischemia-reperfusion injury of the eye. Protracted disability in individuals with these conditions is due, in large part, to the poor regenerative capacity of the CNS, which includes the retina, optic nerves, brain, brainstem and spinal cord. There is a dire need for novel therapies that not only mitigate but also reverse chronic neurological deficits. One potential strategy that has been proposed to promote  neuroprotection  and  regeneration  involves  modulation of the local immune response to CNS damage. Studies in cutaneous wound healing, atherosclerosis and myocardial infarction have elucidated  alternative  immune  pathways  that  most  likely  evolved to  repair  bystander  tissue  damage  associated  with  the  clearance of  microbial  infections 1-3 .  Although  CNS-infiltrating,  proinflammatory leukocytes are detrimental in the context of multiple sclerosis  and  neuromyelitis  optica ,  and  possibly  Alzheimer's  disease 4 and stroke 5,6 , there is growing evidence that alternatively activated, restorative leukocyte subsets and their products can improve clinical  outcomes  in  a  range  of  neurological  disorders 7-10 .  A  deeper understanding of the phenotypes of beneficial immune cells, their developmental pathways and mechanisms of action, could lead to the development of novel neurorestorative immunotherapies.

A  classic  model  of  immune-driven  CNS  axon  regeneration involves crush injury to the murine optic nerve, resulting in extensive  neuronal  loss  and  axonal  transection,  which  is  mitigated  by intraocular (i.o.) injection of zymosan, a fungal cell wall extract 11,12 . Similarly to white matter tracts in the brain and spinal cord, transected axons in the optic nerve fail to undergo long-distance regeneration. However, i.o. zymosan injection, at the time of optic nerve crush (ONC) injury or up to 3 d afterwards, induces vitreal inflammation associated with rescue of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs, the

neurons that give rise to the axons in the optic nerve) from death, and RGC axon regeneration. We previously showed that β -1,3-glucan, a cognate ligand of the innate immune pattern recognition receptor dectin-1, is the active ingredient in zymosan responsible for its pro-regenerative properties in this model 12 . We detected dectin-1 on eye-infiltrating myeloid cells, as well as on retina-resident microglia and dendritic cells (DCs), in i.o. zymosan-injected mice, but not on RGCs, Muller cells, oligodendrocytes or astrocytes. The cellular and molecular mediators that trigger neurorepair downstream of dectin-1 signaling are poorly understood. In the current study, we identify a unique granulocyte with characteristics of an immature neutrophil that accumulated in the vitreous fluid in response to i.o. zymosan and exerted neuroprotective and axonogenic effects that are, in part, secondary to the secretion of a cocktail of growth factors. We found that the same myeloid cell subset was capable of driving axon regeneration in the spinal cord, demonstrating its relevance across CNS compartments. A human cell line with characteristics of immature neutrophils also exhibited neuroregenerative capacity, suggesting that our observations might be translatable to the clinic.

## Results

Intraocular  Ly6G lo neutrophils  drive  RGC  axon  regrowth. We used flow cytometric analysis to determine the cellular composition of infiltrates that accumulated in the posterior chamber of the eye following i.o. zymosan injection and ONC injury (gating strategy is illustrated in Extended Data Fig. 1a). Vitreous fluid was serially collected until day 14 after ONC injury, a standard time point when optic  nerves  are  harvested  to  assess  axon  regeneration.  Myeloid cells (neutrophils and monocytes/macrophages) were predominant at  every  time  point  (Fig.  1a).  Neutrophils  outnumbered  all  other leukocyte subsets from days 1-5 following i.o. zymosan injection, previously  established  as  the  critical  time  window  for  instigating

RGC rescue and axonal regeneration 11 . Lymphocytes and DCs were minor constituents of the vitreal infiltrates, irrespective of the day of harvest. Intraocular zymosan-driven RGC axon regeneration was unimpaired in Rag1 - -/ mice, indicating that mature T and B cells are dispensable in this model (Extended Data Fig. 1b).

To assess the contribution of neutrophils, we attempted to impede their  entry  into  the  posterior  chamber  of  the  eye  with  a  blocking  antiserum  specific  for  CXCR2,  the  predominant  chemokine receptor  expressed  by  mature  murine  neutrophils.  Unexpectedly, systemic  administration  of  anti-CXCR2,  from  the  day  of  ONC injury/i.o. zymosan injection onward, significantly enhanced RGC survival  and  axon  regeneration  (Fig.  1b-e).  The  augmentation  of axonal  regeneration  by  administration  of  anti-CXCR2  was  sustained  through  day  28  following  ONC  injury/i.o.  zymosan  injection (Extended Data Fig. 1c), with some axons reaching the optic chiasm (data not shown). Flow cytometric analyses revealed that i.o.  neutrophil  accumulation  was  delayed,  but  not  prevented,  in the cohort treated with anti-CXCR2, such that the number of neutrophils peaked on day 5 rather than days 1-3 (Fig. 1a). The peak of  i.o.  monocyte  and  DC  accumulation  was  delayed  until  day  7. Furthermore, the characteristics of the infiltrating leukocyte population were altered. Intraocular inflammatory cells, isolated between days 3 through 7 after ONC injury/i.o. zymosan and anti-CXCR2 treatment, contained an expanded  subpopulation of CD11b + myeloid  cells  that  expressed  relatively  low  amounts  of  Ly6G  and Ly6B and had relatively high expression of CD14, when compared with i.o. infiltrates isolated from the mice treated with control sera (Fig. 2a). The majority of these Ly6G lo CD14 hi cells had ring-shaped nuclei and were CD101 lo-neg ,  indicative of an immature neutrophil phenotype (Fig. 2a,b). In contrast, their Ly6G hi CD14 low counterparts (the  most  populous subset in the control group), universally had segmented nuclei and were CD101 hi , consistent with conventional mature  neutrophils.  Both  Ly6G lo CD14 hi and  Ly6G hi CD14 low cells possessed cytoplasmic granules and expressed comparable amounts of elastase and myeloperoxidase (Fig. 2b). Intraocular Ly6G  cells, + isolated  5 d  following  ONC  injury/i.o.  zymosan  and  anti-CXCR2 treatment,  directly  stimulated  the  neurite  outgrowth  of  primary RGCs in vitro (Fig. 2c). The frequency of Ly6G lo CD101 lo-neg myeloid cells  was  elevated  in  the  blood  and  spleen  of  the  cohort  treated with anti-CXCR2, suggesting that the combination of i.o. zymosan

injury received a single i.o. injection of zymosan or PBS on day 0 and i.p. injections of either normal rabbit serum (NRS) control or α CXCR2 antiserum every other day starting on day 0. a , The cellular composition of vitreal infiltrates collected at serial time points from zymosan-injected eyes in the NRS or α CXCR2 treatment groups ( n /thinspace = /thinspace10 eyes per group at each time point).

Ly6G (APC-Cy7)

derived from the groups treated with either the anti-CXCR2 or control sera, with profiles indicative of immature (cluster 3), intermediate (cluster 2) or mature (cluster 1) stages of neutrophil development (Fig. 3a,b). Consistent with our flow cytometric data, the percentage of i.o. Ly6G + cells that fell within the immature neutrophil cluster was more than threefold higher in mice treated with anti-CXCR2 compared to mice treated with control sera (36.8% versus 10.6%, respectively).  These  results  confirm  that  RGC  axon  regrowth  is associated with the accumulation of immature neutrophils close to the site of nerve injury.

## Zymosan-induced Ly6G lo  cells are alternatively activated. Novel

subpopulations of neutrophils were recently described in animal models of cancer, myocardial infarction and infection. 'N2' neutrophils,  which  express  arginase-1,  vascular  endothelial  growth factor  (VEGF α )  and  bear  a  ring-shaped  nucleus,  were  initially identified  in  intratumoral  infiltrates 13 . These  cells  are  distinct from  conventional  'N1'  neutrophils,  which  express  proinflammatory  cytokines  and  chemokines  and  bear  a  multi-segmented nucleus. Enrichment of N2 neutrophils in the tumor bed is associated with impaired antitumor immunity and accelerated tumor growth.  Unconventional  neutrophils  with  features  similar  to N2 cells have subsequently been described in animal models of helminth  and  staphylococcus  infection,  stroke  and  myocardial infarction 14-16 . In all of these models, unconventional neutrophils are characterized by ring-shaped nuclei, as well as expression of genes encoding type 2 cytokines ( Il4 , Il5 and/or Il13 mRNA) and genes  traditionally  associated  with  alternatively  activated  'M2' macrophages  (such  as Arg1 /arginase-1, Mrc1 /mannose  receptor (CD206), Il4ra /interleukin(IL)-4 receptor α -chain, Itga6 /VLA-6, Tgfb1 /transforming  growth  factorβ 1, Igf1/i nsulin-like  growth factor 1 and Ccl5 ). However, the ability of alternatively activated neutrophil subsets to induce neuroprotection and neuroregeneration has yet to be demonstrated.

Reminiscent  of  the  'N2'  and  the  other  alternatively  activated neutrophils described above, Ly6G lo cells,  purified from the vitreous fluid of mice on day 5 after ONC injury/i.o. zymosan/ α CXCR2 treatment,  exhibited  elevated  abundance  of  transcripts  for Arg1 , Mrc1 and Il4ra relative  to  their  Ly6G hi counterparts  (Fig.  3c). Furthermore,  a  significant  percentage  of  those  cells  expressed arginase-1 protein (Fig. 3d). Consistent with these results, scRNA-seq of i.o. Ly6G  cells revealed that transcripts for + Arg1 and Mrc1 ,  as  well  as Itga6 , Tgfb1 , Igf1 and Ccl5 ,  were enriched in the immature neutrophil subset (cluster  3)  that  was  expanded  in  the cohort treated with α CXCR2 (Fig. 3a,b and Extended Data Fig. 3). Thus, zymosan-induced Ly6G lo  neutrophils have characteristics of an alternatively activated myeloid cell.

## Donor Ly6G lo  cells promote RGC survival and axon regrowth.

We used an adoptive transfer approach to directly evaluate the neuroprotective  and  pro-regenerative  potential  of  zymosan-elicited Ly6G lo neutrophils  in  vivo.  The  low  yield  of  Ly6G lo cells  sorted from vitreal infiltrates of mice injected with i.o. zymosan prohibits  adoptive  transfer  experiments with those cells. As an alternative approach, we isolated Ly6G  cells from the peritoneal cavities + of naive mice at serial time points following intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection  of  zymosan,  and  characterized  them  by  flow  cytometric analysis and  quantitative PCR  with  reverse  transcription (RT-qPCR). We found that neutrophils isolated on day 3 after i.p. zymosan injection (3 d N ϕ ) simulated a number of the properties of the pro-regenerative neutrophils harvested from the eyes of the i.o. zymosan/anti-CXCR2 treatment group, including relatively low expression of cell surface markers Ly6G and CD101, high expression of cell surface CD14 and high expression of Arg1 , Il4ra and Mrc1 transcripts (Fig. 4a,b). In contrast, neutrophils isolated from the peritoneal cavity of mice 4 h following i.p. zymosan injection

When injected into the eyes of wild-type mice with ONC injury, 3 d  N ϕ induced  robust  RGC  survival  and  axonal  regeneration, while 4 h N ϕ were less effective, and naive bone marrow neutrophils (BM N ϕ ) had no significant impact (Fig. 4c, Extended Data Fig. 4a and data not shown). In mice genetically deficient in the zymosan  receptors  dectin-1  and  TLR2,  3 d  N ϕ promoted  RGC axon  regeneration,  ruling  out  the  possibility  that  free  zymosan particles  (either  inadvertently  cotransferred  with  donor  neutrophils  or  released  into  the  vitreous  fluid  by  dying  donor  neutrophils) are responsible for their pro-regenerative effect (Extended Data Fig. 4b). Intraocular transfer of 3 d N ϕ was still  capable of triggering  RGC  axon  regeneration  when  delayed  by  6 h  (and  to some extent, up to 12 h) from ONC injury, demonstrating a therapeutic window that extends beyond the time of the acute traumatic event (Extended Data Fig. 5a).

Intraocular injection of 3 d N ϕ (and, to a lesser extent, PBS) resulted in upregulation of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and Iba-1 staining in retinal cross-sections obtained from mice with ONC injury (Extended Data Fig. 4c). Enhanced Iba-1 staining is consistent with activation of retinal microglia, which we previously reported occurs in response to ONC injury alone 12 . Both GFAP and Iba-1 expression waned by 14 d after transfer and, at that point, were comparable between the groups injected with 3 d N ϕ versus PBS. Transfer of 3 d N ϕ triggered secondary recruitment of host monocytes from the periphery via a CCR2-dependent pathway (Extended Data Fig. 4e). Alternatively activated neutrophils have  been  shown  to  polarize  monocyte/macrophages  toward  a reparative  and/or  pro-resolving  phenotype  that  enhances  healing  in  animal  models  of  helminth  infection,  myocardial  infarction and acetaminophen-induced liver injury 14,17,18 .  However, 3 d N  promoted axon regeneration in ϕ Ccr2 - -/ hosts, independent of i.o. monocyte/ macrophage infiltration (Extended Data Fig. 4e,f). This finding is consistent with the ability of highly purified 3 d N  to directly induce neurite outgrowth of RGCs in culture, in ϕ the absence of other myeloid cell subsets (Fig. 5a). When 3 d N ϕ were added to dissociated RGCs 4 h after the neurons were plated, they were still able to induce neurite outgrowth, providing further evidence that neurons remain responsive to the regenerative properties of alternatively activated neutrophils in a therapeutic paradigm (Extended Data Fig. 5b). Collectively, these data demonstrate  that  zymosan-modulated  Ly6G lo neutrophils  directly stimulate the regeneration of transected optic nerve axons in vivo and are capable of doing so after a substantial delay from the time of acute injury.

Ly6G lo neutrophils secrete an array of growth factors. Conditioned culture medium harvested from 3 d N ϕ (3 d NCM) promoted neurite outgrowth of primary RGCs, indicating that soluble factors are, at  least  in  part,  responsible  for  the  pro-regenerative  properties  of 3 d N ϕ (Fig. 5a). The neurite growth-promoting effect of NCM was heat  sensitive,  suggesting  that  proteins  were  responsible  for  this activity. We performed a multiplexed antibody array assay to screen NCM for a panel of candidate growth factors. Nerve growth factor (NGF) and IGF-1 were highly elevated in NCM versus unconditioned medium (Extended Data Fig. 6a). High expression levels of NGF and IGF-1 by 3 d N ϕ , in comparison to 4 h N ϕ , were corroborated by RT-qPCR and ELISA (Fig. 5b). NGF and IGF-1 proteins were readily detectable in the vitreous fluid on days 3 and 5 following i.o. zymosan injection, and their abundance was enhanced by the administration of α CXCR2 antiserum (Fig. 5c).

Neutralization  of  either  NGF  or  IGF-1  with  antagonistic  antibodies  mitigated  NCM-driven  RGC  neurite  outgrowth  in  vitro (Fig.  5d).  Neutralization  of  both  growth  factors  together  had  a greater impact than blocking either one alone. Similarly, i.o. administration  of  either  anti-NGF  or  anti-IGF-1  neutralizing  antibody, at  the  time of 3 d N ϕ adoptive transfer, impeded RGC protection and axon regeneration in vivo; administration of both antibodies had an additive effect (Fig. 5e,f). Conversely, recombinant NGF and IGF-1 acted in a collaborative fashion to promote RGC neurite outgrowth in vitro and RGC axon regeneration in vivo (Extended Data Fig. 6b,c). These findings indicate that zymosan-modulated Ly6G lo neutrophils promote neuronal survival and axon regeneration, in part, via secretion of NGF and IGF-1.

Ly6G lo cells drive repair in the spinal cord. To determine whether the neuroregenerative effects of Ly6G lo neutrophils are limited to RGCs and the microenvironment of the eye, or are more broadly applicable, we assessed their effects on dorsal root ganglia (DRG) cells. Importantly, 3 d N ϕ stimulated axon outgrowth of primary DRG neurons when added at the initiation of culture or up to 8 h later,  whereas  naive  bone  marrow  neutrophils  and  4 h N ϕ were ineffectual (Fig. 6a; Extended Data Fig. 5c). The CM of 3 d N ϕ also induced neurite outgrowth of DRG (Fig. 6a). To test the regenerative potential of alternatively activated neutrophils in the setting of traumatic SCI, we injected 3 d N ϕ , 4 h N ϕ , naive bone marrow neutrophils or PBS alone into sciatic nerves 5 d before laceration of spinal cord dorsal columns at the T4 level. For a positive control, a separate group of mice was subjected to conditioning injury (that is, sciatic nerve crush) 5 d before SCI, which is a widely used

We found severed dorsal column axons retracted proximally, away from the injury  site,  in  the  groups  of  mice  that  had  been  injected  in  the sciatic  nerves  with  either  vehicle  or  bone  marrow  neutrophils (Fig.  6b).  Administration  of  4 h N ϕ prevented  axonal  retraction

but did not trigger regeneration past the injury site. Conversely, severed axons regrew rostrally in the mice that had been injected with  3 d  N ϕ ,  passing  beyond  the  injury  site  by  a  distance  commensurate to that reached by axons in mice subjected to a conditioning  injury.  Thus,  3 d  N ϕ displayed  neuroprotective  and pro-regenerative functions in several CNS compartments, namely the optic nerve and the spinal cord.

Human  neutrophil-like  cells  are  neuroregenerative. We  next investigated  the  capacity  of  human  myeloid  cells,  with  characteristics of an immature neutrophil, to initiate neurorepair. HL-60 is a human promyelocytic leukemia cell line that, following short-term resting culture with dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), exhibits morphological,  enzymatic  and  chemotactic  properties,  and  a  cell  surface antigen profile, indicative of immature neutrophils (that is, promyelocytes and blasts) 20,21 . At that point, they are deficient in secondary granules, suggestive of an early developmental stage in the granulocyte  lineage 22 .  Similarly  to  zymosan-modulated  Ly6G lo murine neutrophils,  HL-60  cells  expressed Arg1 and NGFB (Fig.  7a). Furthermore, they stimulated the regrowth of severed RGC axons upon adoptive transfer into the eyes of RAG1-deficient mice with ONC injury (Fig. 7b). In contrast, adoptive transfer of DG-75 cells, a human B cell lymphoma line, had no measurable effect. CM of HL-60 but not DG-75 cells induced neurite outgrowth by explanted RGC and DRG neurons (Fig. 7c and data not shown). Similarly to 3 d N ϕ NCM, the axonogenic effect of HL-60 NCM was heat sensitive and partially suppressed by neutralization of NGF (Fig. 7c). HL-60 but not DG-75 cells directly stimulated neurite outgrowth by human cortical neurons in co-cultures (Fig. 7d). These results illustrate the neuroprotective and reparative potential of immature human granulocytes, mediated in part by a growth factor-dependent mechanism.

## Discussion

In this study, we identify a novel myeloid cell phenotype with neuroprotective  and  axogenic  properties  that  arises  in  the  setting  of optic nerve and spinal cord injury. In contrast to the widely held notion that myeloid cells that promote tissue repair are generally of  the  monocyte/macrophage  lineage 23-26 ,  the  reparative  cell  that we  characterize  here  is  a  CD14 + Ly6G lo granulocyte  with  features of an immature neutrophil. This finding is particularly surprising since  numerous  studies  have  highlighted  the  destructive  impact of  neutrophils  infiltrating  the  CNS 27-30 .  However,  as  opposed  to pro-regenerative  CD14 Ly6G lo + cells,  the  neutrophils  that  mediate CNS damage in these experimental systems are mature hypersegmented neutrophils, that access the CNS in a CXCR2-dependent

manner. Although a few published studies have suggested that neutrophils may play a beneficial role in the context of CNS trauma 31,32 , here we characterize a CD14 Ly6G lo + neutrophil subset and its biological  functions.  The neuroprotective and axonogenic properties of the CD14 Ly6G lo + cells are, in part, secondary to secretion of the growth  factors  NGF  and  IGF-1.  Although  highly  effective,  treatment  with  a  combination  of  antibodies  against  NGF  and  IGF-1 did  not  completely  abrogate  CD14 Ly6G + lo neutrophil-mediated axonal regeneration in vivo, implicating the presence of additional growth-promoting factors. Proteomics analyses have revealed numerous  growth  factors,  besides  NGF  and  IGF-1,  in  vitreous fluid isolated from i.o. zymosan-injected mice, as well as supernatants of pro-regenerative 3 d N Φ , that could collectively contribute to RGC rescue and axon regrowth (data not shown). Interestingly, we  have  found  that  adoptively  transferred  3 d  N Φ spatially  align against the inner retina; the role of cell-to-cell interactions in the RGC regenerative process is a subject of ongoing investigation. We have  considered  the  possibility  that  pro-regenerative  neutrophils, and their products, modulate Muller glia and/or retinal astrocytes, and that these glial cells, in turn, promote or amplify RGC survival and axon regrowth, possibly via production of NGF and IGF-1 or other factors such as apolipoprotein E and ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) 33 . GFAP expression is elevated in the retina of mice following i.o.  injection  of  3 d  N Φ ,  indicative  of  reactive  astrogliosis. Future experiments with conditional knockout or transgenic mice might help clarify the roles and mechanisms of action of different glial populations in the regenerative process.

Our findings add to a growing body of literature that attests to the  heterogeneity  and  functional  subspecialization  of  circulating and tissue-infiltrating  neutrophils.  In  particular,  zymosan-elicited neuroregenerative neutrophils are reminiscent of recently described subpopulations of neutrophils that bear the signatures of an early developmental stage (based on cell surface phenotype and nuclear morphology), as well as alternative activation (based on expression of markers associated with M2-like macrophages), and play immunoregulatory and/or reparative roles in murine models of cancer, chronic  infection and  myocardial  ischemia 13-15,17 . Alternatively activated neutrophils have been detected in ischemic brain tissue

in  rodent  models  of  stroke,  and  their  frequency  correlates  with increased  neuronal  survival,  reduced  infarct  size  and  enhanced clinical recovery 16,34 . The extent to which the alternatively activated neutrophils characterized in these diverse models are biologically or developmentally related to one another, or share common mechanisms of action, remains to be determined. The existence of human neuroregenerative  neutrophils  is  supported  by  our  finding  that HL-60 cells, widely used as a surrogate for immature human neutrophils, have axonogenic properties comparable to zymosan-elicited CD14 Ly6G lo   murine  neutrophils.  HL-60-mediated  neurite  out-+ growth is also partially dependent on NGF but not IGF-1 (data not shown).  However,  HL-60  is  a  transformed  myeloid  leukemic  cell line,  as  opposed  to  a  subset  of  naturally  occurring,  primary  neutrophils. An atypical subpopulation of Arg1  primary human neu-+ trophils,  isolated  in  the  low-density  mononuclear  layer  of  Ficoll gradients,  has  been  described  in  the  setting  of  advanced-stage cancer, HIV infection, pregnancy and systemic lupus erythematosus 35-40 . Although heterogeneous, the majority of these low-density neutrophils  are  immature  on  the  basis  of  nuclear  morphology (banded)  and  cell  surface  phenotype  (CD33 + CD10 CD16 lo ).  In  a -number of studies, low-density human neutrophils were shown to possess immunosuppressive properties 35-37 . It is unknown whether they also possess reparative properties and/or they mobilize to sites of CNS injury.

ONC injury, in and of itself, induces the upregulation of dectin-1 on retinal microglia and DCs 12 . We hypothesize that engagement of dectin-1 on resident myeloid cells triggers the generation of a local inflammatory  milieu  conducive  to  the  recruitment  and  polarization  of  neuroregenerative Ly6G lo neutrophils.  Granulocyte colony stimulating  factor  levels  rise  in  the  vitreous  fluid  and  the  serum following i.o. zymosan injection, in conjunction with the mobilization of CD101 CD14 Ly6G lo  neutrophils, which bear ring-shaped -+ nuclei,  into  the  bloodstream  (data  not  shown).  These  circulating Ly6G lo cells  do  not  express  Arg1  or  other  markers  of  alternative activation, suggesting that they have not acquired neuroprotective or growth-promoting properties in the periphery (data not shown).

a , NGF protein levels were measured in CM of HL-60 and DG-75 cells by ELISA; Arg1 and NGF mRNA levels were measured in HL-60 and DG-75 cells by qPCR and normalized to Act β ; data are representative of four independent experiments. Statistical significance was determined by a two-tailed unpaired Student's  -test. t b , Human HL-60 or DG-75 cells or murine 3/thinspaced N Φ were adoptively transferred into the vitreous fluid of C57BL/6 RAG1 - -/ mice on days 0 and 3 after ONC injury. Optic nerves were harvested 14/thinspaced later. Bar graph shows the density of regenerating axons in optic nerve sections at serial distances from the crush site ( n /thinspace = /thinspace8 nerves per group). Data are from one experiment representative of two independent experiments. Statistical significance was determined by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's post hoc test (** P /thinspace &lt; /thinspace0.01, *** P /thinspace &lt; /thinspace0.001 and **** P /thinspace &lt; /thinspace0.0001, compared with DG-75). c , Primary RGCs were cultured with unconditioned medium (no tx) or HL-60 CM in the presence of either isotype control, anti-NGF antibodies or heat-shocked HL-60 CM. Neurite length was measured 24/thinspaceh later ( n /thinspace = /thinspace200 RGCs per condition). One of two independent experiments is shown. Statistical significance was determined by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's post hoc test (**** P /thinspace &lt; /thinspace0.0001, compared with unconditioned medium;  ## P /thinspace &lt; /thinspace0.01 and #### P /thinspace &lt; /thinspace0.0001, compared with HL-60 CM/thinspace + /thinspaceisotype antibodies). d , Primary human cortical neurons were cultured with unconditioned medium alone (no tx), NGF (positive control), HL-60 cells or DG-75 cells. Neurite length was measured 24/thinspaceh later ( n /thinspace = /thinspace1,000 neurons per condition). One of two independent experiments shown. Statistical significance was determined by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's post hoc test (**** P /thinspace &lt; /thinspace0.0001, compared with no tx; #### P /thinspace &lt; /thinspace0.0001, compared with DG-75 cells). a-d , Data are shown as the mean/thinspace ± /thinspaces.e.m.

Hence,  it  is  likely  that  Ly6G lo neutrophils  are  polarized  toward  a neuroregenerative  phenotype  only  after  they  cross  the  blood-eye barrier.  Zymosan-elicited Ly6G lo neutrophils express low levels of CXCR2 and infiltrate the vitreous fluid by a CXCR2-independent pathway.  We  are  currently  interrogating  candidate  chemoattractants, other than ELR + CXC chemokines, that might orchestrate their migration to the posterior chamber of the eye, as well as candidate

polarizing factors that might drive their differentiation locally. We are hopeful that this research will inform the development of protocols  for  the  generation  of  neuroregenerative  neutrophils  from bone marrow precursors ex vivo, with the ultimate goal of reinfusing  the  polarized  neutrophils  into  individuals  with  axonal  injury, as an autologous cellular therapy. Alternatively, selected mobilizing and polarizing factors could be administered systemically, or at sites of CNS injury, to expand endogenous populations of alternatively activated neutrophils. Finally, identification of CD14 + Ly6G lo neutrophil chemoattractants may lead to the development of strategies that  promote  the  migration  of  endogenous,  as  well  as  adoptively transferred,  reparative  neutrophils  to  sites  of  CNS  injury  while blocking the migration of potentially toxic mature neutrophils or other pathogenic leukocytes. In previous studies of the ONC model, multimodal therapeutic approaches were more effective than single agents, in some cases achieving RGC axon regeneration across the optic chiasm (such as i.o. zymosan injection combined with a CAMP analog and Pten deletion) 41 .  The distinctive mechanism of action  of  the  Ly6G lo neuroregenerative  neutrophil  subset  makes it  an attractive candidate for multimodal therapy, in synergy with agents that block cell-intrinsic or cell-extrinsic suppressors of axon growth, to rescue dying neurons and enhance axonal regeneration after CNS injury.

## Methods

Mice. C57BL/6 WT, Ccr2 - -/ (B6.129S4Ccr2 tm1Ifc /J), Clec7a - -/ (B6.129S6Clec7a tm1Gdb /J), Tlr2 - -/ (B6.129Tlr2 tm1Kir /J) and Rag1 - -/ (B6.129S7Rag1 tm1Mom /J) mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory. Dectin-1-TLR2 doubledeficient ( Clec7a - -/ Tlr2 - -/ ) mice were bred and maintained in-house. Mice were group housed with a 12-h light/dark cycle and ad libitum access to food and water. All animal handling and surgical procedures were performed in compliance with national guidelines and approved by the University of Michigan and the Ohio State University Committees on Use and Care of Animals.

Optic nerve crush surgery and intraocular zymosan injection. Adult male or female mice (aged 8-10 weeks) were anesthetized with 100 mg per kg body weight (mg kg -1 ) ketamine and 10 mg kg -1 xylazine i.p. The optic nerve was exposed through an incision in the conjunctiva while being visualized under a Nikon microscope. The nerve was then compressed, ∼ 1-2 mm behind the eye, for 5 s using a curved forceps (Dumont no. 5; Roboz). Immediately after ONC injury, the posterior chamber of the eye was injected with 3 μ l of zymosan (12.5 μ g μ l 1 in PBS) or PBS alone, using a Hamilton syringe with a 30-gauge removable needle. The eyes were then rinsed with a few drops of sterile PBS. Ophthalmic ointment (Puralube; Fera Pharmaceuticals) was applied on the operated eye. For all surgical procedures, buprenorphine (0.1 mg kg -1 , subcutaneous) was given before and after surgery (12, 24, 36, 48 and 60 h). All operated mice were closely monitored until the endpoint. Two weeks after surgery, mice were given a lethal dose of ketamine/xylazine i.p. and then perfused transcardially with PBS for 5 min. Mice were inspected for lens injury after each i.o. injection and those with cataracts were eliminated.

Administration of antiserum. Mice were injected, i.p., every 2 d with 500 μ l of rabbit polyclonal α CXCR2 neutralizing sera (Cocalico) or control sera (NRS; Sigma), as previously described 42 .

Intraperitoneal lavage and neutrophil isolation. Mice were injected i.p. with 500 μ l of zymosan (2 μ g μ l 1 in PBS) and euthanized either 4 h or 3 d later via CO2 fixation. Next, 10 ml of sterile ice-cold PBS was injected into the peritoneal cavity and aspirated after 5 min. Neutrophils were isolated from lavaged cells with magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) Ly6G magnetic beads (Miltenyi Biotec) following the manufacturer's instructions. Purity (95-99%) was confirmed using flow cytometry.

Intraocular adoptive transfer. Purified Ly6G  cells were resuspended in sterile + PBS at a concentration of 1 × 10 5 cells per μ l and loaded into a Hamilton syringe with a 30-gauge needle. In some cases, anti-NGF (Alomone) and/or anti-IGF-1 (Abcam) polyclonal antibodies, or polyclonal control antibodies (Sigma), were included in the cell suspension, at a final concentration of 1 μ g/ μ l. 3 μ l of cell suspension was injected into the posterior chamber of each eye of anesthetized mice on days 0 and 3 after ONC injury.

Intraocular administration of growth factors. Recombinant mouse NGF (R&amp;D) and/or IGF-1 (Peprotech) were reconstituted in sterile PBS at a concentration of 1 μ g μ l 1 . Recombinant growth factors or PBS alone were injected into the posterior chamber of the eye (1-2 μ l per eye) of anesthetized mice immediately following ONC injury and on post-op day 3.

Dorsal spinal cord injury. Male mice were anesthetized with 100 mg kg -1 ketamine and 10 mg kg -1 xylazine i.p. The T8 lamina were removed under a stereomicroscope using micro-rongeurs. The spinal column was exposed, and Roboz McPherson-Vannas Micro Dissecting Spring scissors were inserted 1 mm deep. A hemisection of the dorsal spinal cord was performed to transect axons in the dorsal columns. Muscle layers were closed with Perma-Hand Black sutures (5-0, Ethicon) and skin incisions were closed with coated Vycryl sutures (5-0, Ethicon). Six weeks after SCI, rhodamine-conjugated dextran MW 3,000 (microruby, Life Technology; 1.5 μ l of 10% solution) was injected into the sciatic nerve using a Nanofil 10μ l syringe with a 36 G beveled needle (World Precision Instrument). Ten days after tracer injection, mice were perfused and spinal cords were harvested for immunohistochemical analysis.

Sciatic nerve crush. Five days before SCI, some mice received a conditioning injury to the sciatic nerve. Mice were anesthetized as described above and the sciatic nerves on both sides were exposed and compressed at mid-thigh level for 10 s using fine forceps (Dumont no. 5). The surgical wound was closed by clipping the overlying skin.

Intraneural adoptive transfer. Purified Ly6G  cells were resuspended in sterile + PBS at a concentration of 1 × 10 5 cells per μ l and loaded into a Nanofil syringe with a 33-gauge needle (World Precision Instrument). Each sciatic nerve was injected with 1.5 μ l of cell suspension.

Primary mouse RGC cultures. Mouse pups between 6 and 7 days old were euthanized. Their eyes were dissected and placed in ice-cold PBS. Under a Nikon

dissection stereoscope, retinas were exposed; the neural layer was dissected and placed into 1 ml of ice-cold PBS. Retinas were transferred to a 15-ml conical tube with 1 ml of 0.05% trypsin (Gibco). Retinas were triturated 20x with a fire polished glass pipette, incubated in a water bath at 37 °C for 5 min, after which trituration was repeated. Trypsin was quenched by adding 10 ml of 10% FBS in PBS. Tubes were centrifuged at 1,500 r.p.m. for 5 min. Supernatant was removed. Cells were suspended in MACS buffer (2% BSA and 0.004% EDTA in PBS). RGCs were isolated with MACS Thy1.2 magnetic beads (Miltenyi Biotec). Purified RGCs were suspended in Neurobasal medium (Gibco) supplemented with B-27 (Gibco), glutamine (2 mM; Gibco) and penicillin-streptomycin (100 units per ml; Gibco) and plated at 1 × 10 4 cells per well in a 96-well plate that had been precoated with poly-l-lysine (Sigma) and laminin (Millipore). RGCs were co-cultured with MACS-purified Ly6G  neutrophils (1 + × 10 4 cells per well), NCM, zymosan (1 μ g ml -1 ) or recombinant CNTF (100 ng ml -1 ) for 20 h at 37 °C and 5% CO , 2 after which they were fixed with ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS for 30 min, before immunohistochemical staining and imaging.

Primary mouse DRG cultures. Lumbar (L4-5) DRG neurons, collected from 8- to 10-week-old mice, were digested with collagenase type 2 (4 mg ml -1 , Worthington Biochemical) and dispase (1 mg ml -1 ; Sigma-Aldrich) for 45 min at 37 °C and 5% CO2. DRG neurons were counted, resuspended in DMEM/F12 (Gibco) with FBS (10%; Atlanta Biologicals), glutamine (2 mM; Gibco), and penicillin-streptomycin (100 units per ml; Gibco) and plated at a concentration of 5 × 10  per well on laminin/ 3 poly-l-lysine-coated 24-well plates. DRG neurons were incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2, either alone or in the presence of Ly6G MACS bead-purified neutrophils (1 × 10  cells per well) or NCM. After 20 h, cultures were fixed with ice-cold 4% PFA 4 in PBS for 30 min before immunohistochemical staining and analysis.

Primary human cortical neuron in vitro culture. Primary human cortical neurons (ScienCell) were thawed, counted, diluted in neuronal medium with neuronal growth supplement (ScienCell) and plated at 1.2 × 10 4 cells per well in a 96-well plate precoated with poly-l-lysine (Sigma) and laminin (Millipore). Neurons were either cultured alone or in the presence of HL-60 cells, DG-75 cells (1.2 × 10 4 cells per well) or recombinant human NGF (10 μ g ml -1 ) at 37 °C and 5% CO2. After 20 h, neurons were fixed with ice-cold 4% PFA in PBS for 30 min, before immunohistochemical staining and imaging.

Immunohistochemistry and quantification of regenerating axons, viable RGCs and neurite length. Optic nerves. Mice were perfused, optic nerves and eyes were dissected and post-fixed overnight in 4% PFA at 4 °C. Nerves were transferred to a 30% sucrose/PBS solution and maintained at 4 °C for at least 2 h and up to 2 weeks. Optic nerves were imbedded in Tissue-Tek OCT compound (Sakura Fintek) and stored at -80 °C. Longitudinal sections (10μ m thick) were cut with a cryostat, mounted on Superfrost Plus microscope slides (Fisher Scientific) and stained with polyclonal rabbit anti-GAP-43 (Abcam). Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Invitrogen) was used for fluorescence labeling. Images were acquired using an Olympus IX71 inverted microscope with Olympus Cellsens Dimension 2.0 software, attached to an Olympus DP72 digital camera. Regenerating GAP-43  axons were counted at each 0.2-mm interval past + the injury site, up to 1.6 mm, using a superimposed grid (3-5 sections per nerve). The number of labeled axons per section was normalized to the width of the section and converted to the total number of regenerating axons per optic nerve, as described previously 43 .

Retinas. For cross-sectional images, eyes were dissected, post-fixed as described above and cryoprotected. Sections (25μ m) were cut with a cryostat and mounted on Superfrost Plus microscope slides, rinsed with PBS, blocked with 5% normal goat serum in PBS with 0.25% Triton X-100 (PBS-T) at 25 °C and incubated with primary antibodies (anti-GFAP at a 1:500 dilution, Sigma; anti-Iba-1 at 1:300, Invitrogen) diluted in blocking solution (PBS-T + 5% goat serum) overnight at 4 °C. The next day, sections were washed with PBS-T and incubated with secondary antibodies (goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488 or goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 594) in blocking solution (PBS + 5% goat serum) for 2 h at 25 °C. DAPI (300 nM) was used to counterstain sections.

For whole-mount analysis, PFA-fixed retinas were placed in a 35-mm dish (Corning) with sterile PBS. The retinal neural layer was dissected out of the globe under a dissecting microscope. Retinas were incubated with goat anti-mouse Brn3a (Santa Cruz) for 3 d, followed by Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated donkey anti-goat secondary antibody (Invitrogen). Retinas were washed, placed on Superfrost Plus microscope slides and imaged. Images were acquired using an Olympus IX71 inverted microscope attached to an Olympus DP72 digital camera. Brn3a  RGCs + were counted over eight fields distributed between four quadrants per retina at prespecified distances from the optic disc using Image J software 32 .

Spinal cords. Dissected spinal cords were post-fixed overnight and transferred to 30% sucrose in solution for cryoprotection. Spinal cords were cut into 25μ m thick sagittal sections using a cryostat and processed for immunostaining 44 . Briefly, spinal cord tissue sections were rinsed with PBS, blocked with 5% normal donkey serum in PBS-T at 25 °C and incubated with primary antibodies (anti-GFAP and anti-laminin

at 1:500 dilution; Sigma) diluted in blocking solution (PBS-T + 3% donkey serum) overnight at 4 °C. The next day, sections were washed with PBS-T and incubated with secondary antibodies (donkey anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488 and donkey anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 647) in blocking solution (PBS + 3% donkey serum) for 2 h at 25 °C. After washing with PBS and mounting (ProLong anti-fade mounting medium; Life Technologies), sections were imaged using a Zeiss Axiovert Zoom fluorescent microscope or Olympus IX71. Regeneration of dorsal column axons was quantified in all sections containing microruby-labeled axons (4-6 sections per animal), as previously described 45 . The lesion center was localized using characteristic GFAP and laminin staining patterns. The average distance from the epicenter to the most rostral, microruby-positive axon tips was measured using ImageJ. The average value from all tracer-containing sections was taken as one data point.

Primary murine DRG, murine RGC and human cortical neurons. Plates were washed in 0.1% PBS-T, then blocked with 10% goat serum in PBS-T for 1 h at 25 °C. After washing twice in PBS-T, samples were incubated with antiβ III tubulin (TUJ1, Promega) in 3% BSA in PBS-T overnight at 4 °C. Following two PBS-T washes, the samples were incubated with an Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibody (Invitrogen) for 1-2 h at 25 °C. Samples were washed twice with PBS and left in a solution of PBS and DAPI (NucBlue Fixed Cell ReadyProbes Reagent, two drops per ml PBS; Thermo Fisher Scientific). RGCs and human cortical neurons were imaged at 20 × and DRG neurons at 10x, using an Olympus IX71 inverted microscope attached to an Olympus DP72 digital camera. Images were analyzed with Neuromath (Weizmann Institute of Science). The longest neurite of each neuron was measured in GraphPad (Prism).

Neutrophil conditioned medium. MACS-purified neutrophils were placed into the RGC base medium (Neurobasal medium with B-27, penicillin-streptomycin and 2 mM l-glutamine) at a concentration of 5 × 10 6 cell per ml and incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO  for 24 h. Supernatant was collected and spun at 1,800 r.p.m. 2

Cell morphology. Purified neutrophils were subjected to cytospin for 5 min at 5.5 × 10 3 r.p.m. Slides were air-dried, stained with Wright-Giemsa solution (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and imaged using an Olympus IX71 inverted microscope.

Flow cytometry. Flow cytometric analysis was performed as previously described 46,47 . Mice were euthanized by isoflurane overdose. Blood was collected from the left ventricle in an EDTA tube. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated over a lympholyte gradient (Cedarlane), and incidental red blood cells were lysed using an Ammonium-Chloride-Potassium Lysing Buffer (Quality Biological). Eyes were dissected, rinsed in PBS and placed in a 35-mm dish (Corning). Each eye was opened, vitreous fluid was collected and retinas were rinsed with 200 μ l of PBS. Cells in the vitreous fluid and retinal rinse were combined.

Cells were labeled with fixable viability dye (eFluor 506 or eFluor 780; eBioscience), blocked with anti-CD16/32 (clone 2.4G2) and stained with fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies specific for CD11b (clone M1/70), CD45 (30-F11), CD11c (N418), CD3 (145-2C11), CD4 (GK1.5), CD8 (53-6.7), CD19 (1D3), CD14 (61D3), Ly6B (7/4), CD101 (polyclonal) and F4/80 (BM8), all purchased from eBioscience; and Ly6C (AL-21) and Ly6G (1A8), purchased from Pharmingen. For intracellular staining, cells were fixed with 4% PFA, permeabilized with 0.5% saponin and stained with fluorescent antibodies specific for arginase-1 (polyclonal; eBioscience), neutrophil elastase (polyclonal; Bioss) or myeloperoxidase (polyclonal; Abcam). Flow cytometry was performed with a FACS Canto II cell analyzer (BD Biosciences). Cells were gated using forward and side scatter after doublet exclusion and analyzed on FlowJo v10 software.

Human hematopoietic cell lines. HL-60 and DG-75 cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). Cells were cultured in RPMI with 10% FBS + 2  mM l-glutamine + penicillin-streptomycin. Approximately 24 h before co-culture with RGCs, cells were transferred to Neurobasal with B-27 supplementation, l-glutamine and penicillin-streptomycin.

Protein analysis. A panel of growth factors was measured in NCM using a growth factor antibody array (RayBiotech). ELISA was used to measure murine NGF (Millipore) and IGF-1 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and human NGF and IGF-1 (both Abcam) protein levels. Total protein was determined via a Bradford assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and used to normalize analyte concentrations.

Quantitative PCR. Cells were resuspended in 300 ml of RLT buffer before Qiagen RNeasy RNA purification. Purified RNA was converted into cDNA using a high-capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Life Technologies). Transcripts were quantified via SYBR Green qPCR performed using an iQ Thermocycler (Bio-Rad) or ABI using Quant Studio Design v1.3. Primer sequences are shown below.

Single-cell RNA-seq 10x genomics. Eyes were dissected and the vitreous fluid was collected. Retinas were rinsed with 200 μ l of PBS and cells collected from rinse. Neutrophils were purified by MACS Ly6G bead purification. Cell purity and viability was confirmed by flow cytometry. A single-cell suspension was submitted to University of Michigan Genomics Core for processing and analysis. The single-cell suspension was loaded onto a well on a 10x Chromium Single Cell instrument (10x Genomics). Barcoding and cDNA synthesis were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the 10x GemCode Technology partitions thousands of cells into nanoliter-scale Gel Bead-In-EMulsions (GEMs), where all the cDNA generated from an individual cell share a common 10x Barcode. To identify the PCR duplicates, a unique molecular identifier (UMI) was also added. The GEMs were incubated with enzymes to produce full-length cDNA, which was then amplified by PCR to generate enough quantity for library construction. Qualitative analysis was performed using the Agilent Bioanalyzer High Sensitivity assay.

The cDNA libraries were constructed using the 10x Chromium Single cell 3  Library Kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. For quality control ' after library construction, 1 μ l of sample was diluted 1:10 and ran on the Agilent Bioanalyzer High Sensitivity chip for qualitative analysis. For quantification, an Illumina Library Quantification Kit was used. Libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq or NextSeq 2 × 150 paired-end kits using the following read lengths: 26-bp Read1 for cell barcode and UMI, 8-bp I7 index for sample index and 98-bp Read2 for transcript. Cell Ranger 1.3 (https://10xgenomics.com/) was used to process Chromium single-cell 3  RNA-seq output. ' 48

Once the gene-by-cell data matrix was generated, poor quality cells were excluded, such as cells with less than 500 unique genes or more than 7,000 unique genes expressed. Only genes expressed in three or more cells were used for further analysis. Cells were also discarded if their mitochondrial gene percentages were over 20%. The data were natural log transformed and normalized for scaling the sequencing depth to a total of 1 × 10 4 molecules per cell, followed by regressing out the number of UMIs using Seurat package (version 2.3.3).

Seurat downstream-analysis steps included SCTransform, dimensionality reduction (principal-component analysis) and UMAP, standard unsupervised clustering and the discovery of differentially expressed cell-type-specific markers. The SCTransform functionality embedded in Seurat R package include normalization and scaling of UMIs, batch information and mitochondrial content. We included the batch information as a variable in the SCTransform to scale out the differences between the batches. For the unsupervised clustering, we chose a low-resolution parameter (0.1). Differential gene expression analyses, to identify cel-type-specific genes, were performed using the non-parametric Wilcoxon rank-sum test. To compare the average gene expression of genes in the cell types identified in the two single-cell datasets, heat maps using Pearson's correlation values were generated.

Statistical analysis. RGC frequency and axon density data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's post hoc test using GraphPad 8.0 (Prism). The unpaired Student's  -test was used to analyze flow cytometry, ELISA and qPCR t data with only two groups, and one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's post hoc test was used to analyze flow cytometry, ELISA, RGC cultures and qPCR data with more than two groups.

Statistical significance was determined by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's post hoc test (** P /thinspace &lt; /thinspace0.01, *** P /thinspace &lt; /thinspace0.001 compared with No T x; # P /thinspace &lt; /thinspace0.05 compared with NGF; ++ P /thinspace &lt; /thinspace0.01, compared with IGF-1). c , Recombinant IGF-1 (blue bars), NGF (green), a combination of NGF and IGF1 (white), or PBS alone (black) was injected into the vitreous on days 0 and 3 post ONC injury. Optic nerves were harvested 14 days later. Density of regenerating axons in optic nerve sections, at serial distances from the crush site (n/thinspace = /thinspace8 nerves per group). One experiment representative of 2 with similar results is shown. Statistical significance was determined by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's post hoc test (* P /thinspace &lt; /thinspace0.05, ** P /thinspace &lt; /thinspace0.01, *** P /thinspace &lt; /thinspace0.001, **** P /thinspace &lt; /thinspace0.0001 compared with PBS; # P /thinspace &lt; /thinspace0.05 compared with NGF; + P /thinspace &lt; /thinspace0.05, ++ P /thinspace &lt; /thinspace0.01, compared with IGF-1). b c , , Data shown as mean ± sem.
