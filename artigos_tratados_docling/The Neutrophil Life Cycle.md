## The Neutrophil Life Cycle

Andrés Hidalgo, 1,2,3, * Edwin R. Chilvers, 4, * Charlotte Summers, 5, * and Leo Koenderman 6, *

Neutrophils are recognized as an essential part of the innate immune response, but an active debate still exists regarding the life cycle of these cells. Neutrophils /uniFB01 rst differentiate in the bone marrow through progenitor intermediaries before entering the blood, in a process that gauges the extramedullary pool size. Once believed to be directly eliminated in the marrow, liver, and spleen, neutrophils, after circulating for less than 1 day, are now known to redistribute into multiple tissues with poorly understood kinetics. In this review, we provide an update on the dynamic distribution of neutrophils across tissues in health and disease, and emphasize differences between humans and model organisms. We further highlight issues to be addressed to exploit the unique features of neutrophils in the clinic.

## The Neutrophil as a Double-Edged Sword in Health and Disease

Neutrophils (also named polymorphonuclear leukocytes) are phagocytes with an essential role in defending the host against invading pathogens, particularly bacteria and fungi [1,2]. The killing of these organisms in phagosomes is mediated by: (i) fusion with lysosomes (granules) liberating cytotoxic proteins, peptides, and enzymes into the phagolysosome [3]; and (ii) activation of a membrane-bound NADPH-oxidase producing superoxide anions (O2 -) that in turn, are metabolized into hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and other reactive oxygen species (ROS) [4]. The cells use these mechanisms both inside the phagolysosome and outside the cell. In the latter process, the fusion of granules (degranulation) and activation of NADPH oxidase localize at the plasma membrane [5,6]. The importance of these processes is illustrated by the severe immunode /uniFB01 -ciencies that, in humans, are associated with impaired killing mechanisms in neutrophils, such as in chronic granulomatous disease (CGD, genetic defects in the multicomponent NADPH oxidase; see Glossary) [7] and Chédiak Higashi syndrome -(granule de /uniFB01 ciency) [8].

Apart from their essential roles in immune homeostasis, neutrophils are involved in the pathogenesis of many in /uniFB02 ammatory diseases, from acute lung injury following major trauma or sepsis, to chronic in /uniFB02 ammation in diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and the many forms of in /uniFB02 ammatory arthritis [9,10]. All these clinical conditions are associated with the dysregulated migration, activation, and survival of neutrophils [11].

Despite the importance of neutrophils in innate immune responses and their well-recognized and deleterious role in in /uniFB02 ammatory diseases, little is known regarding their life span(s) both in time and place, and in health and disease [12,13]. Likewise, it is unclear whether heterogeneous neutrophil populations exist, with distinct temporal and anatomical properties [10]. However, it is clear that, on the one hand, targeting the full neutrophil compartment in in /uniFB02 ammatory diseases will cause more problems than solutions. On the other hand, if neutrophils could be targeted via disease-speci /uniFB01 c mechanisms, while leaving their major immune and homeostatic functions intact, such interventions would hold signi /uniFB01 cant promise in the treatment of a subset of in /uniFB02 ammatory diseases (such as COPD), many of which represent a global epidemic in the aging population. To achieve this, it is mandatory to understand the basic rules guiding the life cycle of neutrophils in health and disease (see the ' Highlights ' box). In this review, we focus on recent new data in this area.

(A) The cartoon depicts a model for neutrophil differentiation in the bone marrow: neutrophil and progenitor differentiation behaves like a ' conveyor belt , as ' /uniFB01 rst suggested by Cartwright and colleagues [43]. Neutrophil-committed differentiation starts with the neutrophilic promyelocyte and myelocyte, which both have the propensity to divide and, as such, are part of the mitotic pool. Hereafter, the cells stop dividing and mature into metamyelocytes and band neutrophils, neither of which are found in peripheral blood (i.e., postmitotic pool). The cells then enter the mature state, entering a state of exchange between the bone marrow, blood, and other tissues.

## Neutrophil Formation and Release from the Bone Marrow

The Mammalian Mitotic Neutrophil Pool

The neutrophil originates from myeloid lineage progenitor cells ( commonmyeloid progenitors , CMPs) located within the bone marrow and extramedullary tissues, including the spleen. During the initial differentiation steps, the myeloid progenitors (myeloblasts) retain their propensity to differentiate into both the monocyte/macrophage lineage and the neutrophil lineage, as well as the other myeloid cells, namely, eosinophils and basophils. This common differentiation ends with the last progenitor, which can differentiate into both lineages, the granulocyte macrophage progenitor (GMP) [14 -19]. Hereafter, the differentiation of neutrophils and monocytes (and other myeloid cells) bifurcates from a metastable bipotent progenitor (in mice) [20] and the /uniFB01 rst progenitor that is ' neutrophil committed ' is the neutrophil promyelocyte [21]. This cell type in humans can be recognized by its round nucleus and relatively dark cytoplasm (Figure 1) and is able to divide; this is the /uniFB01 rst neutrophil maturation stage of the so-called ' mitotic neutrophil pool . The number of di-' visions occurring in these promyelocytes in humans is unclear because these cells can either proliferate or differentiate into the next stage, the myelocyte [18,21]. This cell can be recognized by its round nucleus with an initial dent and less-dark cytoplasm compared with the promyelocyte. It is the last neutrophil maturation stage in the neutrophil lineage that can proliferate, and represents the last cell in the mitotic pool (Figure 1).

Several early studies indicated that human myelocytes [22,23] and possibly promyelocytes [23] might be heterogeneous in their propensity to divide. It was initially proposed that up to 50% of these cells proliferated, albeit slowly, and resided in a so-called lazy pool [22,23]. It is thought that these cells do not contribute greatly to granulopoiesis in homeostasis, yet provide a means to mobilize neutrophils quickly, when required by accelerated or ' emergency proliferation ' and differentiation [24]. The presence of a putative lazy pool is important for the interpretation of kinetic data obtained by cellular modeling, because the number of progenitors cycling (cell cycle) is lower than assumed in models (see later and [13]).

Recently, several studies used mass cytometry by time of flight (CyTOF) and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to re-examine the proliferation and differentiation of the neutrophil lineage, and identi /uniFB01 ed (in both mouse and human bone marrow) the presence of neutrophil progenitor cells, referred to as neutrophil progenitors (preNeu, NeuP, or NEP); these appear to be committed, unipotent, and early-stage neutrophil progenitors, as shown by adoptive transfer assays, IdU labeling, and the in vivo determination of cells entering the cell cycle (e.g., by using the Fucci-474 reporter mouse) [16,17,19]. However, these studies did not ' bench-mark ' these cells with the known promyelocyte and myelocyte stages described earlier. Therefore, it remains uncertain whether these progenitors are new and/or unique or re /uniFB02 ect all, or part of, the known (pro-) myelocyte pools.

## The Postmitotic Neutrophil Pool

Following the myelocyte stage, the neutrophil progenitors lose their capacity to divide and enter the so-called ' postmitotic pool , particularly studied in human cells [25 ' -28]. This represents the beginning of a true maturation program starting with metamyelocytes, which in humans are characterized by a kidney-shaped nucleus and clear cytoplasm. These cells, in turn, mature into banded cells with horseshoe-shaped nuclei and clear cytoplasm (Figure 1). These cells are not found in the peripheral blood in homeostasis, but can be identi/uniFB01 ed in the circulation during periods of acute infection or in /uniFB02 ammation, resulting in the so-called

' left shift ' in the neutrophil population, /uniFB01 rst described by Arneth [29]. The postmitotic pool takes ~5 -6 days from the last division of the myelocyte to the transition of the banded cell into the mature neutrophil in humans (Figure 1) [13,25,27,28]. This time is signi /uniFB01 cantly shorter (2 -3 days) in rodents [30].

## The Mature Neutrophil Pool

Most studies of neutrophil differentiation to date consider that the mature neutrophil in the bone marrow represents the end of the postmitotic stage. These studies imply that neutrophils undergo terminal differentiation in the bone marrow before being liberated into the peripheral blood [31]. Some authors suggest that part of the large number of human bone marrow neutrophils (7×10 /kg body weight) are mobilized as a 9 ' rapid mobilizable pool ' during periods of in/uniFB02 ammatory stress [32 -34]. However, it is uncertain what the fate of these cells is under homeostasis, given that overt apoptosis in the neutrophil pool in the bone marrow is rare. In support of this concept, a recent study analyzing the neutrophil transcriptome and epigenome [35] suggested that the largest differences arising during the differentiation of human neutrophils in the bone marrow occur during transition from the bone marrow mature neutrophil pool to neutrophils in the peripheral blood. However, an important caveat of this human study was that the bone marrow and blood cell samples were taken from different donors, and that the isolation procedures differed. This leaves open the possibility that the differences observed were caused by interdonor differences and/or ex vivo manipulation of these human cells. It is important to emphasize that there are clear differences between human and murine neutrophils (Table 1).

There are further concerns regarding the concept that terminal differentiation of ' mature ' neutrophils is completed in the bone marrow before mobilization to the peripheral blood, because mobilization of these cells during acute in /uniFB02 ammation should then be associated with ' neutrophil rejuvenation ' in the blood compartment [36]. However, this was not found in one study, where metabolic labeling of human neutrophils in vivo showed that the neutrophils mobilized during acute experimental in /uniFB02 ammation induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and exhibited the same kinetics as mature cells before challenge, implying that they were the same age post labeling [36].

## Trends in Immunology

Hence, it is possible that the mature neutrophil compartment behaves as a single compartment in full exchange between the blood, bone marrow, and possibly other tissue sites, such as spleen. This would imply that neutrophilia and the ' left shift ' seen during in /uniFB02 ammation might be explained by a mere shift in relative sizes of the pools residing in bone marrow and peripheral blood. This shift in cell numbers can quickly normalize by remigration of blood cells back to the bone marrow pool upon regaining homeostasis [37,38]. However, this interpretation awaits experimental support.

## Differentiation Outside of the Bone Marrow

A fascinating issue when considering the life cycle of neutrophils is the possibility that these cells undergo terminal differentiation outside the bone marrow. This concept is hypothetical but is supported by several lines of evidence, including the presence of immature progenitors traf /uniFB01 cking throughout multiple tissues in mice [39]. This concept provides a rationale as to why progenitors are mobilized into the peripheral blood to allow alternative imprinting by extramedullary sites. Not much is known about the putative underlying mechanisms, but neutrophil progenitors have been found in the spleen [40]; it is tempting to speculate that tissue-induced, and possibly tissueselective, alternative imprinting can result in the generation of neutrophil subsets with alternative functions, as discussed later for the mouse. Indeed, some studies have suggested that neutrophil -myeloid-derived suppressor cells (granulocyte MDSC) differentiate in the spleen and contribute to cancer progression [41].

## Cellular Markers of Different Neutrophil Differentiation Stages in Humans

The account of the myeloid lineage detailed earlier is descriptive and, until recently, based largely on direct microscopic analysis. A rather historic but landmark study [42] reported that the absolute number of promyelocytes/myelocytes, metamyelocytes, banded neutrophils, and mature cells in the bone marrow is remarkably stable, suggesting a conveyor belt-like model [43]. Another important /uniFB01 nding from these early studies was that the total bone marrow pool of neutrophils is six to eight times larger than the total peripheral blood pool [26,42,43].

Newer technologies based on /uniFB02 ow cytometry have con rmed the heterogeneity of neutrophils /uniFB01 within the bone marrow, but to date, this has not been aligned with the corresponding morphology of these populations [44]. A similar type of analysis is detailed in Figure 1, which shows that the entire differentiation pathway of human neutrophils can be captured using the expression of three cell surface receptors: Mac-1 (CD11b), L-selectin (CD62L), and Fc RIII (CD16). Flow sorting of the different populations and subsequent analysis of the resulting cytospin preparations demonstrates that it is possible to identify and isolate the different maturing forms of neutrophils in the bone marrow and peripheral blood. Additional markers, such as CD10, CD13, CD64, and CD87, can be used to facilitate the discrimination between mature and immature neutrophils [45 -47].

Such /uniFB02 ow technology-based approaches to cell phenotyping can also allow for a more accurate quanti cation of cell numbers within various differentiation stages in the bone marrow. However, /uniFB01 the existing studies do not completely align [42,44]. This might re /uniFB02 ect the fact that bone marrow aspirates are poorly representative of the total cell content of the bone marrow following hemodilution [48]. It might also represent a sturdier association of progenitors with the bone marrow stromal niche, which may serve to trap more immature dividing cells in the stroma. It will be important to obtain experimental data to determine the absolute numbers of neutrophils and neutrophil precursors in the bone marrow, because this is the basis for future models describing the differentiation and kinetics of the neutrophil compartment (see later). Work over the past decade has demonstrated that the peripheral neutrophil compartment is heterogeneous and different

## Trends in Immunology

populations of cells are characterized by distinct nuclear morphologies [11,45,49]. In particular, human neutrophils with a hypersegmented nucleus have gained interest because they have been shown to have the ability to suppress T cells [45,49], but have lost the capability to intracellularly contain bacteria [50]. The issue of neutrophil heterogeneity is beyond the scope of this review and has been addressed by several recent reviews [2,10,46,51].

## The Kinetics of Circulating Neutrophils

## Intravascular Neutrophil Pools

Mature neutrophils are present in the vasculature in two pools: a free/uniFB02 owing intravascular blood pool and a blood pool residing in certain tissues. This latter pool is generally referred to as the ' marginated pool ' . Early studies suggested that marginated neutrophils were in complete equilibrium with free/uniFB02 owing cells and, therefore neutrophils from either pool were indistinguishable [52]. The major sites for marginated neutrophils in humans are the liver, spleen and bone marrow itself [53], with debate existing regarding their presence in lungs, which may be speci /uniFB01 c only for certain species, such as primates, mice, and dogs [54 -56].

The kinetics of circulating neutrophils and neutrophil precursors remains somewhat uncertain. In 1929, Weisskotten carried out experiments to determine the kinetics of neutrophils in the peripheral blood of rabbits using a toxin, benzol, which speci /uniFB01 cally targeted cycling cells [57]. This work concluded that the half-life (t ½) of circulating neutrophils in the rabbit was 3 -4 days. However, this study fell into oblivion because more recent labeling studies did not support this relatively long half-life (see later).

## Neutrophil Kinetics in Peripheral Blood: Re-Infusion of Ex Vivo -Labeled Neutrophils

Important experiments performed during the 1950s and 1960s, and con rmed recently, led to /uniFB01 the commonly cited belief that circulating human neutrophils are short-lived cells with a t ½ of 7 -9 h [26,43]. In these experiments, ex vivo -labeled autologous neutrophils were infused into volunteers and the disappearance rate of the label in the blood was interpreted as representative of the circulatory half-life of these cells. This conclusion was supported by metabolic labeling in mice with D2O, showing t½ of ~9 -18 h [12,58]. The interpretation of the human data has been challenged by authors who have argued that ex vivo manipulation of neutrophils might have changed the homing characteristics of these cells, affecting their behavior in peripheral blood [31]. While deliberate priming of neutrophils both ex vivo and in vivo impacts the distribution of these cells within the vasculature, with most neutrophils homing to the lung [59,60], these data have been consistently reproduced using newer techniques that induce minimal-to-no detectable cell priming (e.g., [61]). Hence, while priming undoubtedly has a profound impact on the behavior of neutrophils in vivo [62 -65], the effect of priming and activation per se on the intravascular half-life of neutrophils has yet to be determined (circulating, marginated, and intravascular entrapment e.g., in the pulmonary capillary network), and many of the above data still stand.

## Neutrophil Kinetics in Peripheral Blood: Radioactive or Stable Isotope Labeling

To circumvent the dif /uniFB01 culties of ex vivo cell manipulation, several studies have applied in vivo labeling methodologies (e.g., with 3 H-thymidine [25], 3 H-DFP, and 32 P-DFP) to track and trace the kinetics of neutrophils [43]. These studies have produced a more /uniFB01 nessed data set than previously, to support both short, as well as relatively long, neutrophil life spans. A short life span in humans is supported by the quick disappearance of label in a logarithmic fashion [43]; however, this assumes that most of the neutrophil compartment is present in the peripheral blood. As discussed earlier [26,42] most of the neutrophil compartment resides outside the bloodstream and is likely to be in complete exchange, although this remains to be determined. Therefore, the disappearance rate of the label might also be explained by a redistribution of the cells into

## Trends in Immunology

the whole neutrophil compartment, which could take several hours. Indeed, in a rat model where labeled neutrophils were re-infused, it took several hours for neutrophils to end up in the bone marrow [37]. Of note, this population of cells that can ' disappear ' from the circulating bloodstream can be re-mobilized, as evidenced from bovine experimental models where calves were challenged with corticosteroids [66]. These results imply that, rather than a formal uptake of neutrophils within a tissue compartment, bone marrow margination from the bloodstream occurs [66]. However, this hypothesis awaits further experimental support. In one of the earlier studies, pulse labeling with 32 P-DFP in vivo led to stable labeling of human blood neutrophils for 11 days, whereas the postmitotic time was ~5 -6 days ([43] and see later); thus, these data could also be interpreted as supporting a longer half-life for neutrophils than 7 -9 h. This /uniFB01 nding would argue for another neutrophil life span where cells might prevail for up to 3 -5 days ([12] and below). Nevertheless, experiments applying in vivo 32 P-DFP labeling are dif /uniFB01 cult to repeat and/ or reproduce based on ethical constraints.

Fortunately, new in vivo labeling technology can re-evaluate these studies by using stable isotope deuterium ( H) in the form of 2 2 H2O or 2 H-6,6-glucose [67]. Under these conditions, deuterium is built into the ribose moiety of the DNA of cycling cells, including cells within the mitotic pool of neutrophils progenitors. This technology allows a pulse-chase experiment by following the enrichment of 2 Hin DNA, only recently applied for the analysis of neutrophil kinetics in peripheral blood; the life span of neutrophils in circulation was concluded to be ~5 days or 18 h for human or murine neutrophils, respectively [12]. However, the /uniFB01 nding for human cells has been challenged by several authors [13,68], arguing that the slowness in disappearance of label from the blood could be explained by a ' slow neutrophil compartment ' in the bone marrow and a ' fast compartment ' in peripheral blood. Indeed, this latter view has been supported by studies using short-term labeling with 2 H-glucose, which also concluded that human neutrophils had a short half-life in peripheral blood [13]. However, these conclusions were based on assumptions that all (pro-) myelocytes divided equally, that neutrophils in the bone marrow and blood did not belong to a homogenous pool, that neutrophils did not return to the bone marrow, and that there was no lazy pool of myelocytes [13]. These assumptions are in contrast with data showing that rat and human dividing (pro-) myelocytes continued to divide with a cycle time of ~14 h [69,70], that the neutrophils migrated back to the bone marrow [37,38], and that the presence of a so-called ' lazy neutrophil pool ' existed [22,23]. In addition, kinetic data relying on metabolic labeling have supported the concept that human neutrophils in the bone marrow and blood can belong to the same kinetic pool [36].

In fact, even these published data could be used to support a signi /uniFB01 cantly longer half-life of human neutrophils in the peripheral blood because the R -value of 5.5 leads to an equally good /uniFB01 t of the data, supporting a t ½ of 2.6 days (life span of 3.7 days) [13]. However, it is debatable that a model based on ordinary differential equations is the best choice for describing neutrophil kinetics because the experimental data are not supportive of a model where all (pro-) myelocytes have an equal chance to divide. It appears more likely that only a part of the (pro-) myelocyte pool is dividing with a narrow division time supporting a ' conveyor belt ' type of differentiation, as suggested previously [43], rather than a model based on probabilities.

From another angle, data obtained in vitro support the hypothesis of prolonged neutrophil survival in vivo under conditions of in /uniFB02 ammation and argue against a short half-life in vivo [71 -75]. Multiple mechanisms have been implicated in contributing to prolonged neutrophil survival, including hypoxia, the release by in /uniFB02 ammatory cells of cytokines and growth factors (e.g., GM-CSF and TNF), of microbe-associated molecular patterns (e.g., LPS), as well as an outcome of viral infections in rodents, such as with cytomegalovirus and respiratory syncytial virus [71 -75]. Unfortunately, direct in vivo data in humans are lacking.

## Neutrophil Fate and Function within Tissue Compartments

## Neutrophil Dynamics in Blood and Tissues

Mouse and human neutrophils that are newly released into the bloodstream are endowed with distinct phenotypic properties in that they gradually change over time following circadian oscillations [76]. Moreover, at least in the mouse, these phenotypic changes parallel changes in their transcriptional and migratory properties of neutrophils [76,77] (Figure 2, Key Figure). A major functional pathway affected by circadian rhythms is the rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton over time, leading to the loss of surface microvilli and the subsequent reduction in the capacity of murine neutrophils to roll on endothelial selectins during daytime. Ultimately, these types of change can result in a reduced ability to migrate to in /uniFB02 amed tissues over time [76]. While the mechanisms of migration are discussed in more detail in other reviews from this special issue of Trends in Immunology

## Key Figure

## Neutrophil Fates within Tissue Compartments

Figure 2. Neutrophils produced in the bone marrow (BM) and released into the circulation can enter multiple tissues after a process of diurnal aging (oscillations in phenotype), even in the absence of in /uniFB02 ammatory stimuli. In tissues, they have prominent roles related to antimicrobial defense, immune cell maturation, and regulation of stem cell niches, or are ultimately eliminated. For example, granulopoiesis and vascular regeneration may represent relevant functions while neutrophils are in the BM and before their release into blood; neutrophils acquire the capacity to regulate the circadian release of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) when they return to the BM for elimination. Similarly, specialized functions in the spleen for B cell maturation, or in the lungs for immunosurveillance, suggest a wealth of functions tailored to each tissue, as detailed in the main text.

## Trends in Immunology

(e.g., [78,79]), it is important to note that rolling-defective neutrophils can still adhere to unstimulated vessels in the dermal microcirculation (and possibly in other tissues) in a selectinindependent manner [77]. The mechanisms involved might be similar to those identi ed for patrol/uniFB01 ling monocytes [80]. These features could explain the ef cient entry of neutrophils from blood into /uniFB01 naïve tissues, including skin, liver, intestine, or bone marrow, while sparing tissues generally considered to be immune privileged, such as the brain and gonads [81]. However, this warrants further investigation. Although similar patterns of recruitment of neutrophils into human tissues have not yet been evaluated, similar circadian properties and kinetics of neutrophils have been reported in cells from human blood [76]. This suggests that multiorgan in /uniFB01 ltration in the steady-state is a conserved feature across species. In addition, indirect demonstration that neutrophils in /uniFB01 ltrate tissues as part of their natural life cycle comes from studies in mice defective in genes needed for neutrophil adhesion and elimination, including integrins, selectins, or the phagocytic receptor Mertk ; these mice develop severe alterations in granulopoiesis and traf /uniFB01 cking of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), even under homeostatic conditions [82,83]. Similar hematopoietic alterations have been found in patients bearing leukocyte adhesion deficiency (LAD) mutations [84]; this suggests that a similar regulatory loop involving neutrophil migration into naïve tissues also operates in humans, although this remains to be further investigated. Mechanistically, this type of regulation in mice appears to be mediated by transcriptional repression of IL-23 expression in tissue-resident phagocytes, the latter engul /uniFB01 ng senescent neutrophils, as shown in in vitro and in vivo mouse studies, where mice lack such relevant genes in vivo [82,83,85]. Thus, these murine studies have prompted renewed interest in de ning the dynamics and fate of neutrophils in healthy /uniFB01 tissues, beyond their lifetime in circulation.

## Neutrophil Retention and Function in the Lung Microvascular Bed

While the dynamics of neutrophil entry into naïve or in /uniFB02 amed tissues is increasingly well appreciated in the mouse [81], whether and how this occurs in human tissues remain largely unknown. Current knowledge in humans largely relies on comparative studies, and only in certain organs, such as the lung or spleen. For instance, intravital microscopy studies in the murine lung microvasculature revealed a substantial number of neutrophils within the network of small capillary vessels that are rapidly mobilized by the chemokine receptor CXCR4 antagonist plerixafor in both mice and primates [52], or which are actively crawling on small pulmonary capillaries in mice [86]. Nonetheless, con /uniFB02 icting studies in humans and mice debate whether CXCR4 is a retention signal for neutrophils in the lungs [87], and further work is required. This margination of circulating neutrophils and intravascular crawling in murine lungs dramatically increase upon exposure to endotoxin or live bacteria relative to naïve mice [86]. Although the size of the intravascular marginated neutrophil pool in humans is thought to be smaller than that in mice [88], similar changes in surface markers and in the number of circulating human neutrophils have been observed after in vivo treatment with endotoxin [86] or platelet-activating factor [57]. This, together with the rapid in vitro adhesion of LPS-stimulated human neutrophils to primary pulmonary endothelial cells [86], suggests that, hypothetically, similar dynamics and intravascular behavior occur in the human lung. In keeping with this notion, humanized sickle-cell disease (SCD) mice display frequent interactions of neutrophils with platelets within the lungs, with formation of microemboli that trigger vaso-occlusive crises and that can recapitulate those occurring in patients with SCD [89]. These series of /uniFB01 ndings suggest the presence of an abundant population of neutrophils in the resting murine pulmonary microcirculation that might serve as a pool for rapid mobilization [52]. The studies mentioned earlier additionally suggest potential roles in local antimicrobial responses or in eliciting acute pulmonary injury. Additional studies in the mouse have shown that the lung may also provide a site of neutrophil reprogramming that enables their return to the bone marrow for /uniFB01 nal elimination [90]; while in turn, pulmonary neutrophils can instruct transcriptional programs in mouse lungs that can in uence metastatic invasion in mouse tumor models [81]. /uniFB02

## Neutrophil Retention and Function in the Spleen

The spleen also represents a tissue in which the function of neutrophils has been studied in considerable detail both in resting and diseased scenarios. Studies of human spleens have demonstrated the presence of at least two populations of neutrophils in the perifollicular zone that induce IgM secretion and Ig-class switch in marginal zone B cells through the secretion of factors BAFF, APRIL, IL-21, and pentraxin 3 [91,92]. Notably, these neutrophil populations in the human spleen were found to be induced postnatally by local signals, such as IL-10 and GMCSF, and were involved in inducing antimicrobial immunoglobulin production in a T cellindependent manner [92]. However, these presumed specialized functions of neutrophils in the human spleen could not be reproduced in an independent study [93]. Furthermore, a B-helper phenotype, which may promote leukemic cell expansion, similar to that found in the naïve human spleen has been reported only in the context of chronic lymphocytic leukemia in the mouse [94]. A recent report demonstrated the presence of additional neutrophil populations in the red pulp of the mouse spleen that cleared Streptococcus pneumoniae from the surface of macrophages, and an additional immature splenic population of neutrophils that expanded upon infection with these bacteria [95]. Thus, resident (and possibly recruited and reprogrammed) neutrophil populations appear to be endowed with distinct antimicrobial functions in the spleen. Of note, while there is clear evidence from transfer experiments of neutrophil accumulation and destruction in the human spleen, where ~30% of all circulating neutrophils end up [96], evidence for the spleen as a major site of destruction of endogenous neutrophils in mice is lacking.

## Neutrophil Uptake and Function in the Liver

The liver is an organ of active accumulation and destruction of neutrophils. Studies in humans demonstrated rapid accumulation of infused, radiolabeled, neutrophils in the liver (the ' hepatic marginated pool ' ), followed by intense phagocytic uptake, suggesting that this organ as an important site for the homeostatic destruction of neutrophils [96,97]. In the rat liver, apoptotic [ terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) dUTP nick-end labeling assay (TUNEL + )] neutrophils can be detected at steady-state, but their number escalates dramatically following LPS treatment [98]. Moreover, Kupffer cells , which line the hepatic sinusoids, actively phagocytose phosphatidyl serine (PS)-positive neutrophils, while depletion of Kupffer cells reroutes neutrophils to other tissues, such as spleen and lungs [98]. These /uniFB01 ndings agree with the observed accumulation of exogenously infused mouse neutrophils mostly in the bone marrow and liver. In this study, immature neutrophils preferentially homed back to the bone marrow and could be remobilized to sites of infection to participate in antimicrobial defense [99]. Of note, the liver is also a key tissue for the elimination of circulating bacteria [100], and neutrophils that have engulfed bacteria and die are taken up by Kupffer cells in a process that blunts the production of in /uniFB02 ammatory cytokines by macrophages and favors resolution of in ammation, once the path/uniFB02 ogens have been cleared [101]. Thus, the liver represents a primary site of neutrophil elimination, although other possible functions for neutrophils within this organ remain to be explored.

## Neutrophil Migration and Function in the Bone Marrow

In addition to being the main site of production, the bone marrow is also a site of active neutrophil clearance. Parabiosis studies in mice demonstrated that senescent or aged neutrophils can return to the marrow upon completion of their life cycle in blood; this was deemed to occur mainly via a CXCR4-dependent mechanism, as shown by impaired migration of CXCR4 mutant cells to the bone marrow of the parabiont [38,90,102]. Furthermore, there is also evidence for active recycling of radiolabeled neutrophils in the human marrow [97]. Whether this scenario maps equally to humans is yet to be determined, because circulating human neutrophils express trace amounts of cell surface CXCR4, and studies using ex vivo radiolabeled neutrophils

## Trends in Immunology

suggested that these cells were randomly removed, rather than in an age-dependent manner [96]. However, various roles of neutrophils in the marrow are beginning to emerge, at least in mice. For example, aged neutrophils that return to the bone marrow after circulating in blood are phagocytosed by medullary macrophages [103], thus suppressing CXCL12-producing niche cells, temporally inhibiting the retention activity of the niche and leading to the circadian release of HSPC into the circulation [102]. Given that similar variations in circulating HSPC numbers occur in the bone marrow of humans [104], it is reasonable to speculate that they perform similar suppressive functions, although this remains to be investigated.

An important but still poorly de /uniFB01 ned issue when considering the fate of neutrophils is their actual lifetime within different tissues before /uniFB01 nal destruction, because this has not yet been rigorously measured. Preliminary evidence in the mouse suggests dwell times of less than 1 day in the steady-state in certain tissues, such as spleen and skin (Hidalgo et al ., unpublished data, 2019), which may still be suf /uniFB01 cient to in /uniFB02 uence many aspects of tissue physiology through the release of cytokines, granule proteins , or even neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), as reported in the human spleen [92], but this awaits full validation. In other contexts, for example the murine lymph node, additional preliminary work, yet to be con /uniFB01 rmed, suggests longer tissue residency times than 1 day (Chilvers et al. , unpublished data, 2019). Of note, these lifetimes can be markedly extended in the context of in /uniFB02 ammation, because multiple cytokines and bacterial products extend the survival of human and murine neutrophils, at least in part, through regulation of the antiapoptotic factor Mcl-1 [105,106]. Thus, essential features of the neutrophil life cycle, namely their life span in different tissues and under in /uniFB02 ammatory states, remain poorly de ned, /uniFB01 and this should be an important task for future research.

## The Yin and Yang of Neutrophil-Targeted Therapies

Several important clinical conditions are associated with either hyper- or hypoactivation of the neutrophil compartment. On the one hand, chronic in /uniFB02 ammatory diseases, such as COPD [107] ,as well as acute in /uniFB02 ammatory conditions, such as systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) [108,109], are typically associated with hyperactivation of neutrophils. Under these conditions, it is possible that inhibition of neutrophils, to prevent clinical complications brought about by a hyperactive immune system, would be bene cial to a patient. Similar inhibition /uniFB01 of neutrophils might be suited for patients with certain cancers where activated neutrophils have a role in suppressing antitumoral immunity ex vivo , such as head and neck cancer [110,111].

On the other hand, insuf /uniFB01 cient activation of neutrophils in clinical conditions such as in the compensatory anti-inflammatory response syndrome (CARS) in patients with multiple injuries or following major surgery can result in the activation of these cells to prevent the development of severe infectious complications, such as sepsis [112,113]. The term ' CARS is ' currently used less often because the hypoin /uniFB02 ammation appears to be initiated alongside the SIRS response [114]. The hypothesized rationale for the occurrence of hypoin /uniFB02 ammation is that it might limit tissue injury and facilitate healing [115]. However, this remains to be directly demonstrated.

It is clear that the timing of therapies modulating immune responses is important because both hypo- and hyperactivation of neutrophils co-occur in patients with acute in /uniFB02 ammatory conditions [112,116]. A clear example are patients who have undergone multiple trauma, where SIRS is dominant during the /uniFB01 rst days after trauma and a dominant hypoin /uniFB02 ammation becomes prominent after several days [117]. Apart from the modulation of activation or inhibition of neutrophil responses under these conditions, novel therapies might also be targeted at the level of the survival and/or apoptosis [118] of neutrophils; examples could include targeting the pro-survival factor Mcl-1 [119] and/or PI-3 kinase [120].

## Clinician s Corner '

Neutrophils are among the principal effectors of the innate immune response and are instrumental in the /uniFB01 rst line of defense against invading microbes.

While there may be important differences between human neutrophils and those of other mammalian species, much has been learned from studies in transgenic animal models.

The production, circulation, and clearance of neutrophils is altered by in /uniFB02 ammatory stimuli, such as those encountered in acute conditions, such as bacteremia, and chronic conditions, such as COPD.

Therapies precisely targeted at the deleterious effects of neutrophils, while leaving bene cial /uniFB01 ones intact, will be required for successful manipulation of these cells in the clinic.

## Trends in Immunology

## Concluding Remarks

The variety of kinetics and functions described for neutrophils is consistent with the emerging view that these cells are multifaceted. At least part of the neutrophil pool is essential in host defense against invading microorganisms and is crucial for a successful immune response. On the negative side, neutrophils are involved in the pathogenesis of a plethora of in /uniFB02 ammatory diseases and can, in certain instances, suppress antitumor responses. Thus, it is clear that neutrophils may become important targets of future therapies to suppress hyperin /uniFB02 ammation as well as hypoin ammation dependent on the nature of the disease. Elucidation of the precise mechanisms /uniFB02 underlying these antagonistic functions might allow the development of new putative therapies that target one set of neutrophil functions while sparing their other bene /uniFB01 cial functions (see Outstanding Questions). In particular, lessons learned from understanding the life cycle of neutrophils in different states and tissues may translate into clinical bene /uniFB01 t; for example, manipulation of the life cycle of neutrophils might enable us to extend the duration of speci /uniFB01 c bene cial functions, /uniFB01 while blocking detrimental functions under pathological scenarios. As we continue to better understand the dynamics and physiological facets of neutrophils, we hope that new therapeutic strategies will appear that harness the unique features of these cells.

What are the real transit times of neutrophils in blood, bone marrow, and tissues? These times may provide insights into the non-immune roles and pathogenic potential of neutrophils in tissues.

What is the evolutionary basis for the diurnal behavior of neutrophils? Gating antimicrobial functions or protecting the tissues of the host are possible bene ts /uniFB01 of this behavior.
