## Abstract

Intestinal ischemia-reperfusion injury (IR) is implicated in various clinical conditions and causes damage to the intestinal epithelium resulting in intestinal barrier loss. This presents a substantial clinical challenge, emphasizing the importance of gaining a comprehensive understanding of molecular events to aid in the identification of novel therapeutic targets. This review systematically explores the extent to which omics technologies-transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and metagenomics-have already contributed to deciphering the molecular mechanisms contributing to intestinal IR injury, in in vivo and in vitro animal and human models, and in clinical samples. Recent breakthroughs involve applying omics methodologies on exosomes, organoids, and single cells, shedding light on promising avenues and valuable targets to reduce intestinal IR injury. Future directions aimed at expediting clinical translation are discussedaswellandincludemulti-omicsdataintegrationtofacilitatetheidentificationof keyregulatorynodesdrivingintestinal IR injury and advancing human organoid models based on the novel insights by single-cell omics technologies, offering hope for clinical application of therapeutic strategies in the years to come.

iology, for instance, during meal ingestion or physical exercise [1, 2]. Severe or prolonged impairment of perfusion can occur as a result of occluded mesenteric vessels due to a blood clot [3-5], as a part of a surgical intervention such as thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair [6], cardiopulmonary bypass, or intestinal transplantation [7], or in case of hypovolemic and septic shock during major surgery or trauma. Intestinal ischemia can also occur secondary to inflammation, whichplaysacrucialroleinthepathophysiologyofinflammatorybowel disease [1, 8].

An important phenomenon in the pathophysiologic cascade of intestinal IR is the disruption of the intestinal barrier as a consequence of oxygen and nutrient shortage to the intestinal tissue leading to tissue damage, followed by the generation of reactive oxygen species

(ROS), induction of cell death pathways, and activation of an inflammatory response upon reperfusion of the tissue [9]. In addition to local tissue damage, disrupted intestinal barrier integrity can lead to the passage of microbial products from the intestinal lumen to the systemic circulation, leading to systemic inflammatory response syndrome and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, a critical condition with high morbidity and mortality [5].

The high morbidity and mortality rates associated with intestinal IR result from a lack of effective therapeutic strategies to alleviate IR-induced intestinal injury and inflammation as well as a delay in diagnosis. Therefore, the application of omics technologies and systemwide molecular profiling may have essential clinical implications; from new insights into the pathobiology aiding in the identification of novel therapeutic targets to the identification of reliable biomarkers aiding in early diagnosis. This comprehensive review explores the extent to which omics technologies have already contributed to deciphering the molecular mechanisms contributing to intestinal IR injury in preclinical and clinical studies, and discusses the challenges and opportunities these technologies present for clinical translation.

To systematically identify articles that applied omics technologies in intestinal IR, the article database of the US National Library of Medicine (PubMed) was searched using the following terms: ((ischemia OR ischaemia) AND reperfusion AND intestin*) AND (transcriptom* OR proteom* OR microarray OR metabolom* OR 'expressionprofil*' OR RNA-sequencing OR omics OR bioinformatic* OR massspectrometry OR metagenom*) till September 30, 2023. For all omics technologies, except metabolomics, we confined our search to article entries created no earlier than January 1, 2013, a decision driven by the dynamic and rapidly advancing developments in omics research. We subjected the initial 83 retrieved articles to a rigorous screening process conducted by two authors, leading to the exclusion of 45 articles that did not align with the specific research focus, such as studies on IR in brain, lung, or heart tissues, or those involving targeted profiling of selected proteins, lipids, or metabolites. Furthermore, we identified five articles among the initial selection where omics technologies were principally employed to elucidate the molecular impact of a particular treatment on intestinal IR injury. These studies did not encompass a comparative analysis between intestinal IR and control conditions, resulting in their exclusion from our review. This resulted in a final set of 33 articles (Table S1) that were further studied regarding used models and methods, sampling, significant changes, enrichment analysis, integration of results, and so forth as described below.

## 2 OVERVIEW OF APPLIED OMICS TECHNOLOGIES IN INTESTINAL IR STUDIES

Starting around 2010, the field of intestinal IR research has witnessed significant advancements driven by the application of cutting-edge omics technologies, including transcriptomics, proteomics and phosphoproteomics, metabolomics, and metagenomics. These tools have played an essential role in the search for both therapeutic and diagnostic targets in the context of intestinal IR. Transcriptomics techniques

are used to study the complete set of RNA transcripts (coding and noncoding) that are produced by the genome under specific circumstances in a cell or tissue, using high-throughput methods, which provides direct insight into cell- and tissue-specific gene expression features during intestinal IR. Proteomics is a complementary approach to transcriptomics that studies the entire set of proteins in that sample. Protein abundance often does not directly correlate with mRNA levels due to post-transcriptional and post-translational regulatory mechanisms, such as protein phosphorylation, glycosylation, and acetylation, which impact protein functionality. Hence proteomics holds the potential to offer a more functionally relevant perspective on the molecular processes involved in IR injury. Proteomics allows the identification of targets that play a role in the pathogenesis of intestinal IR or that can serve as biomarker. Metabolomics is the large-scale study of metabolites in a biological sample. As metabolites are the end products of cellular processes, their levels can change in direct response to pathophysiological conditions. Hence, metabolomic studies can reveal changes in metabolic pathways and the concentrations of specific metabolites that are associated with intestinal IR, demonstrating metabolic consequences. Metagenomics , a discipline centered on the exploration of the metagenome (collective genetic material of microorganisms within a sample), serves as a valuable tool for uncovering insights into the diversity and functional potential of the gut microbiota. Metagenomic studies hold the promise of shedding light on the complex relationships between gut microbiota and the mechanisms driving IR-related tissue damage.

## 3 OMICS IN IN VIVO MOUSE AND RAT INTESTINAL IR MODELS

The majority of preclinical studies in this field were conducted in vivo in animal intestinal IR models, mostly carried out in mice and rats, in whichintestinal IR was induced by occlusion of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) for 30-120 min followed by various short and prolonged reperfusion periods, up to 72 h, or by clamping peripheral branches of the SMA of an isolated intestinal segment.

## 3.1 Transcriptomics

In our literature search, 15 studies made use of transcriptomics technology to study intestinal IR injury versus sham surgery in animals [10-24] (Table 1, part I). The aims of these studies ranged from exploring overall changes in gene expression in intestinal IR for a better understanding of the pathological process and/or to identify potential therapeutic targets [10, 16, 17, 21], to specific testing of a therapeutic intervention [11, 13, 15, 18, 19], or both [12, 14, 23, 24]. For these studies, mice were most commonly used to establish an intestinal IR model [11, 13, 15-19, 21], and two studies made use of rats [10, 14]. After a suitable IR model was established and sample collection was performed, transcriptome data were generated, mostly by microarray [10-18, 21], and more recently, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) [19, 23].

Most research focused on gene expression in the small intestine, with the exception of the study of Zhang et al., in which intestinal tissue exosomes were sequenced [23], and the study of Chang et al. that, in addition to intestinal tissue, also examined kidney and muscle [10]. Figures 1A and 1B together with Table S1 provide detailed information on the diverse target tissues and materials (derived from both animal andhumanmodels),protocol,andmethodologyofeacharticleincluded in this review.

Transcriptomics data were either generated in house or an existing data set was obtained from platforms such as the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) or the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA). Most of the selected studies looked at mRNA [10, 16, 18, 19], however, since gene regulation relies on complex interactions between coding and noncoding RNAs, other studies looked at combinations of mRNA with noncoding RNA types [15, 17, 21], while some focused on miRNA [11-14, 24] or circular RNA [23] only. To analyze the transcriptomic data, most studies performed Gene Ontology (GO) functional analysis, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis, and establishment of a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, or a combination thereof [15-17, 19, 21]. Studies looking at miRNA used multiple online tools such as TargetScan, miRwalk, miRDB, and

miRanda for predicting miRNA target genes [11-15, 21]. Protein target prediction of circRNA was performed using the catRAPID, RBPDB, and RBPmap databases, based on a list of identified proteins through RNApulldown and proteomic analysis [23].

A plethora of regulated genes and pathways involved in intestinal IR pathology have been elucidated. However, it is noteworthy that most articles have not included a comprehensive list of differentially expressed genes. In this context, we have attempted to present the main findings on IR-related differential expression as perceived by the authors, and these findings are summarized in Table 1.

Most of the studies tested a therapeutic intervention and/or proposed(a)potential target(s) [11-15, 17-19, 21, 23, 24], and around half of these also included proof of concept in vivo and/or in vitro [11-14, 18,19,24].ThespecificsoftheseresultsarealsosummarizedinTable1.

As demonstrated, the application of transcriptomics is a valuable strategy to disclose gene expression profiles associated with intestinal IR injury. Assessing IR-induced differentially expressed genes, as well as regulated pathways and networks led to prioritizing and pinpointing potential therapeutic targets. Interfering with these targets has the potential to mitigate the pathophysiological processes associated with IR injury (see Table 1, Proof of concept).

## 3.2 Proteomics

Onlythreearticles reported on the application of proteomics technologies to investigate the underlying mechanisms of intestinal IR in preclinical models; with a specific focus on rat neutrophils [25-27]. These studies employed label-based (iTRAQ) quantitative liquid chromatography (LC) tandem mass spectrometry (MS) (LC-MS/MS), a method known for its improved performance in terms of sensitivity, selectivity, reproducibility, and protein coverage when compared to classical techniques such as two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DGE) combined with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF)-MS or LC-MS/MS for protein separation and identification, which were previously applied to analyze intestinal IR tissue samples [28-30]. The adoption of quantitative LC-MS/MS resulted in the identification and quantification of many more proteins, which laid the foundation of the first comprehensive (phospho)proteome analyses with subsequent GO, pathway, and protein network analyses of circulating neutrophils in rats subjected to intestinal IR [25-27].

Neutrophils play a crucial role in the maintenance of intestinal homeostasis. They are able to eliminate microbes that have translocated across the intestinal barrier, and, during inflammation, they contribute to the recruitment of other immune cells and facilitate mucosal healing [31]. In a human model for intestinal IR, neutrophils very rapidly invaded the IR-damaged villus tips, indicating their clinical relevance in this IR pathology [9]. This makes it a very interesting immune cell to study further by means of quantitative proteome analyses to unravel the molecular mechanisms by which they participate in IR injury. Several hundred proteins were significantly differentially expressed in circulating neutrophils between sham surgery and intestinal IR. We reanalyzed the set of differentially expressed proteins of Arshid et al. [25] using Metascape, a powerful open-access resource for computational analysis and interpretation of large-scale datasets [32], with the list of all identified proteins as background [26]. Pathway and process enrichment analysis was performed with the following ontology sources: GO Biological Processes, KEGG Pathway, Reactome Gene Sets. Terms with a p -value &lt; 0.01, a minimum count of 3, and an enrichmentfactor &gt; 1.5 werecollectedandgroupedinTableS2(TabAandB). The analysis revealed that downregulated proteins were significantly enriched in RHO GTPase effectors, regulation of actin cytoskeleton (including leukocyte transendothelial migration), innate immune system (including neutrophil degranulation), hemostasis, regulation of actin filament organization, positive regulation of cell adhesion, regulation of cell activation (including regulation of leukocyte activation). Important downregulated proteins include neutrophil cytosolic factor 2, cytochrome b-245 beta chain, Rac family small GTPase 2 which are all subunits of the NADPH oxidase NOX2, an enzyme that produces the majority of ROS in neutrophils. Myeloperoxidase, also downregulated in circulating neutrophils upon IR, is another important contributor to ROS. These oxidants are crucial for the killing of microbes but are also essential for the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) that can capture pathogens and prevent their dissemination [33]. Neutrophilic serine proteinases, such as cathepsin G and proteinase 3, both downregulated, can also concentrate in these NETs upon their release

[34]. These data suggest a substantial role for NET formation in intestinal IR injury, which was recently demonstrated in clinical samples as well as in mice subjected to intestinal IR [35].

The same analysis on upregulated proteins revealed a strong enrichment for ribosome, ribosome biogenesis, RNA processing, DNA replication, regulation of translation, translation initiation, and protein folding (including protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum [ER]), which are processes fundamental for the protein synthesis machinery. Thesefindings need to be considered in light of the highly dynamic neutrophil pool. Neutrophils are very short-lived cells with a half-life of only 1 day and they are one of the first cells to infiltrate in infected or damaged tissues [36].

## 3.3 Metabolomics and metagenomics

Five studies reported the use of metabolomics technologies to study intestinal IR injury [37-41], of which two also applied metagenomics [40, 41]. The earliest investigation into metabolomics in the context of intestinal IR injury dates back to 2010. A comparative analysis was performed on the repercussions of intestinal IR injury by occlusion of either mesenteric artery (MA) or portal vein (PV) in a rat model. Metabolomics profiling was performed by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy on small intestinal tissue extracts revealing nine metabolites exhibiting a significant difference among three groups (sham, MA, PV), namely: glucose, lactate, the amino acids glutamate, glutamine, and methionine, the grouped essential amino acids (valine, leucine, and isoleucine), and the lipids triacyl-glycerol, fatty acids, and total blood lipids. Their study indicated that PV occlusion showed a more pronounced metabolic adaptation, characterized by heightened glycolytic activity and the accumulation of fatty acids and amino acids, while MA occlusion was characterized by higher levels of oxidative stress [37].

In the study of Khadaroo et al., mouse urine was investigated by NMR spectroscopy and a comparison was made between shamoperated mice with those subjected to 30-60 min of ischemia followed by 2 h of reperfusion. Higher levels of allantoin and creatinine were found irrespective of ischemia duration compared to sham. In the 30-minute ischemia group, methylamine levels were high and choline levels were low, while the opposite pattern (low methylamine levels and high choline levels) was found with longer ischemia duration. Furthermore, there was a decrease in leucine and proline, coupled with an increase in valine and isoleucine following 60-min ischemia [38]. These results demonstrate that urinary metabolite profiles can capture distinct patterns based on the duration of intestinal ischemia, thereby providing insight into the evolving metabolic responses. Although not the focus of this review, these findings could hold relevance for diagnosing intestinal IR, shedding light on the duration (and hence severity) of intestinal ischemia.

To gain insights into the dynamic response of the body to intestinal IR injury, a detailed longitudinal analysis of tracer metabolomics (profiled at 15 time points over a 72-h period) in the blood of rats was performed. Through LC-MS, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry

16159861, 2024, 12-13, Downloaded from https://analyticalsciencejournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pmic.202300160 by CAPES, Wiley Online Library on [01/08/2024]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by

(GC-MS), and dynamic datasets analysis methods such as principal component analysis, 39 significantly altered metabolites were identified, including amino acids, lipids, cholic acids, and others. Employing longitudinal pattern recognition, eight major temporal clusters of significantly changed molecules (grouped into four main patterns), were identified, which enabled uncovering associated metabolic pathways and networks. During the initial reperfusion period, metabolites in the pathway named phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan metabolism peaked, achieving their highest levels between 0 h (i.e., end of ischemia) and 2 h of reperfusion. This suggests an increase in biosynthesis or a delay in the degradation of these metabolites. Conversely, the metabolites in the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids pathway exhibited an opposite trend, with levels of oleic acid, palmitic acid, arachidonic acid, linoleic acid, and stearic acid reaching its nadir at 2 h of reperfusion. Other imperative pathways that were regulated during IR included amino acid biosynthesis, 2-oxocarboxylic acid metabolism, arginine-related metabolism, and glutathione metabolism [39].

Huang et al. applied nontargeted LC-MS and 16S rDNA sequencing on mouse feces to investigate the role of gut microbiota in the protective effects of preoperative fasting against intestinal IR injury. Intestinal IR decreased the Î± -diversity of gut microbiota and increased the Firmicutes:Bacteroidetes only in control animals and not in fasted animals. Moreover, intestinal IR increased the abundance of Helicobacteraceae and Ruminococcaceae and decreased that of Muribaculaceae and Bacteroidaceae. Fasted mice displayed significantly higher levels of petroselinic acid (PSA) than nonfasted mice. Antibiotic treatment reduced cecal PSA levels, indicating that this metabolite is produced by gut microbiota. Overall, PSA treatment was found to alleviate intestinal injury in vivo and could decrease apoptosis by activating the AMPK-mTOR-P70S6K pathway in vitro, suggesting a protective role for microbial metabolite PSA in intestinal IR injury [40].

In a recent study, Dai et al. investigated the role of gut contents in intestinal IR-induced remote injury [41]. They analyzed the blood, gut contents, and 15 organs in rats during different phases of intestinal IR injury through LC- and GC-MS and identified 132 significantly changed metabolites. Alterations in intestinal microbiota were studied with metagenomic next-generation sequencing. No significant differences were found in gut microbial Î± -diversity between groups. Obligate anaerobes increased post-ischemia, declining after 6 h of reperfusion. Proinflammatory and neurotransmitter-producing species increased significantly in abundance at 6 h of reperfusion compared to ischemia alone. Changes in taxa included reduced beneficial microbes ( Lactobacillus johnsonii , Lactobacillus sp ASF360), and increased Escherichia coli and Bacteroides vulgatus , and species in the Enterobacteriaceae and Enterococcaceae families. Functional analysis revealed that bacterial metabolisms associated with the biosynthesis of neurotransmitters-related metabolites were significantly augmented. This was also supported by cross-tissue metabolite correlations that revealed an important role for gut contents in intestinal IR-induced damage to remote organs. Metabolites that were still markedly altered after 6 h of reperfusion were mainly neurotransmitter-related, such as acetylcholine, histamine, and N G ,N G -dimethyl-L-arginine (ADMA). In addition, correlations between gut

contents and remote organs also mainly consisted of neurotransmitters or molecules associated with neurotransmitter biosynthesis or regulations (such as phenylalanine, linoleic acid, and hypotaurine). These neurotransmitters may contribute to the long-term impact of intestinal IR and play crucial roles in the pathophysiological processes of IR-induced damage of remote organs [41].

To verify if gut contents leaked into remote organs during IR due to a compromised intestinal barrier, the levels of FITC-dextran, an orally administered permeation marker, were measured in distant organs, along with endotoxin levels. Conducting metagenomic next-generation sequencing on blood samples, as was performed in critically ill patients [42], would provide valuable insights to detect and identify pathogens that have been translocated from the gut into the systemic circulation in the context of intestinal IR.

## 4 OMICS TECHNOLOGIES IN HUMAN STUDIES OF INTESTINAL IR

While animal research has significantly advanced our understanding of intestinal IR [43], it is imperative to put efforts toward translating these findings into clinic applications. To this end, a safe, ethically sound, minimally invasive, and standardized human model of small intestinal IR was developed in patients undergoing abdominal surgery [44]. More specifically, in patients undergoing pylorus-preserving pancreatico-duodenectomy,avariablelengthofhealthyjejunumisroutinely resected. An isolated 6-cm segment of this part of jejunum is exposed to IR in vivo during surgery and consecutive tissue is collected immediately after ischemia (ranging from 30 to 60 min), and after 30 and 120 min of reperfusion, as well as an unexposed control sample, allowing time series analyses within each subject. Important insights that were uncovered using this model were comprehensively reviewed by Grootjans et al. [44]. Short periods of ischemia appeared to affect only the villus region and damage was repaired in a timely manner without inducing an overt inflammatory response, whereas prolonged ischemia (45-60 min) resulted in more severe tissue damage with an influx of neutrophils at the villus tips and apoptosis of Paneth cells, important guardians of the intestinal barrier, in the crypt bottom [44]. Time series transcriptomics and proteomics analyses were conducted on these tissues to investigate the molecular changes in this clinically relevant experimental model of human IR injury [45, 46].

Another set of studies employed omics technologies to analyze intestinal tissues obtained from patients afflicted by intestinal IR injury caused by MA embolism or thrombosis, or by venous congestion or incarceration [47-49].

## 4.1 Transcriptomics

Five articles reported on the application of transcriptomics in human studies on intestinal IR [20, 45, 47, 49, 50] (Table 1, part II), of which two made use of the human experimental model [45, 50]. Kip et al. revealed the temporal transcriptional changes that occurred during

30-45 min of ischemia followed by 30 and 120 min of reperfusion in the human experimental model conducted in seven patients [45]. Enriched GO terms during short reperfusion included 'response to unfolded protein,' 'response to stress,' 'heat shock protein binding,' and'unfoldedproteinbinding,' indicating problems regarding properly folding and disposing of damaged proteins. As reperfusion continued, the focus shifted towards processes related to intestinal remodeling. GOterms such as 'blood vessel morphogenesis,' 'apoptosis,' and 'cell adhesion molecule binding' were prominent during this stage [45]. Moreover,thestudyalsoexaminedgeneexpressionchangesinrelation to specific biological pathways using the KEGG database. During the 0-30-min reperfusion phase, genes involved in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway and protein processing in the ER were significantly overrepresented. In the subsequent 30-120 min reperfusion phase, the analysis revealed signs of bacterial invasion and increased cell proliferation [45]. This study examined transcription factor network hubs that were crucial in the response of the human intestine upon intestinal IR injury and showed HIF1A as one of the key regulators. Moreover, genes annotated to the GO term 'response to unfolded protein' were centered around HIF1A. Subsequent experiments conducted on human intestinal organoids demonstrated that exposure to hypoxia-reoxygenation (HR) triggered the activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) accompanied by the induction of pro-apoptotic signaling, which could be effectively inhibited with the pharmacological UPR inhibitor ISRIB [45].

The transcriptomic data of this human study (available via GEO database: GSE37013) were also analyzed by Cong et al. using a different bioinformatics approach [50]. Time series analysis revealed five significant clusters based on their gene expression patterns. GO BP analysis of genes with a downward trend revealed enrichment in GO terms 'defense response to bacterium' and several metabolic processes. Genes with an upward trend were overrepresented in the GO terms 'G-protein coupled receptor signaling pathway' and 'regulation of transmembrane transport.' Genes with a steep rise during early reperfusion were enriched in processes linked with cellular component assembly. PPI network analysis of the genes in the significant clusters revealed HUNK and PTPRC (belonging to the cluster with strong upregulation during early reperfusion) to rank the highest suggesting them to be central hubs in the response to intestinal IR [50]. Although the article of Cong et al. [50] provided additional insight, some limitations worth noting are the lack of information on the identity of the differentially expressed genes (both as a whole and within individual clusters), as well as the lack of gene sets corresponding to the different GOterms. It is imperative for future research to address these data gaps for a more comprehensive understanding. A broader consideration related to PPI and network analysis and its interpretation relates to the lack of direct correlation between gene expression and protein abundanceandactivity. As a result, it is imperative to interpret the data with caution and provide additional evidence.

Three articles reported on transcriptome data of intestinal tissue of patients suffering from intestinal IR [20, 47, 49]. The primary investigation was conducted by Jiang et al., encompassing a cohort of eight patients, of which five individuals exhibited arterial prob-

lems, specifically embolism or thrombosis, while the remaining three were diagnosed with venous-related issues, such as congestion or incarceration [47]. These patient groups were compared to a control group comprising five surgical patients without intestinal IR, for whom clinical conditions were not specified [47]. Additionally, information about the specific location of the intestinal tissue sampled and the severity of ischemia was not provided [47]. The study focused on identifying miRNA-mRNA networks. Yet, data of the differentially expressed genes between groups were also reported and provided an interesting resource to further disentangle the regulated processes in patients. Hence, we reanalyzed the data set of Jiang et al. using Metascape, with the list of all expressed genes as background. Pathway and process enrichment analysis was performed with the following ontology sources: GO Biological Processes, KEGG Pathway, Reactome Gene Sets. Terms with a p -value &lt; 0.01, a minimum count of 3, and an enrichment factor &gt; 1.5 were collected and grouped in Table S2 (Tab C to F). The analysis revealed that upregulated genes in the intestinal tissue affected by arterial ischemia were enriched in the GO terms 'inflammatory response,' 'neutrophil degranulation,' 'chemotaxis,' 'response to molecule of bacterial origin,' 'signaling by interleukins.' Downregulated genes were enriched in the GO terms 'monocarboxylic acid metabolic process,' 'biological oxidation,' 'small molecule catabolic process' and other metabolic and transport processes. Enrichment analysis for ischemic conditions of venous origin primarily revealed the predominance of GO terms associated with inflammatory processes among the upregulated genes. Conversely, downregulated genes exhibited enrichment in GO terms related to developmental and remodeling functions, exemplified by terms such as 'anterior/posterior pattern specification' and 'extracellular matrix organization.' The absence of predominant representation of metabolic processes within this context underscores the distinct responses observed in ischemic conditions originating from arterial and venous factors.

The gene set of this article (available via ENA database: PRJEB45362) was also employed by Zhu et al. to validate findings obtained in a mouse intestinal IR model [20]. Their study focused on the interaction between differentially expressed genes related to ferroptosis and immunity, and revealed similarities between human and mouse data [20]. Ferroptosis, a form of regulated cell death characterized by iron-dependent accumulation of lipid ROS, has been implicated in intestinal IR [51]. Interestingly, ferroptosis-related genes ACSL4 (involved in lipid peroxidation) and GPX4 (a strong suppressor of ferroptosis) were also found to be differentially expressed in the human experimental IR model, with ASCL4 being upregulated and GPX4 downregulated during prolonged reperfusion, which both are suggestive for triggering ferroptosis [52]. To elucidate additional shared mechanisms between the human experimental model and the 'real-life' clinical scenario, a comparative analysis was performed by juxtaposing the two sets of differentially expressed genes of the study of Kip et al. [45] and Jiang et al. [47]. It is of note that a total of 393 shared genes was exclusively identified when comparing the gene set of the ischemic conditions attributed to arterial factors (embolism, thrombus) with that of the human experimental model (in which both

See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by

the mesenteric arteriole and venule, which feed and drain the specific intestinal segment, respectively, were clamped). This shared gene set offers insights into potential targets to further examine in an experimental setting. For instance, enrichment analysis of shared genes has highlighted significant GO terms, such as 'response to wounding,' 'response to growth factor,' and 'response to oxygen levels.' These GO terms represent essential biological processes and signify potential targets for therapeutic intervention, including prominent genes like CCN1, CCN2, HBEGF, VEGF, and HIF1A. Their modulation holds promise for the promotion of healing responses within the context of intestinal IR.

The study of Jia et al. focused on the identification of differentially expressed miRNA using miRNA-Seq analysis on intestinal tissue samples of three ischemic patients and three healthy controls [49]. Of all detected miRNAs, 11 were upregulated and seven were downregulated after intestinal ischemia. Analysis of KEGG signaling pathways revealed the upregulated miRNAs to be significantly associated with the inhibition of epithelial barrier function and cell proliferation. Interestingly, and similar as in the human intestinal IR model, protein processing in ER appeared also in this list of KEGG pathway enrichment terms [49]. As elucidated in Table 1, validation of identified target pathways has been substantiated through empirical evidence obtained from studies conducted in the context of human intestinal organoids[45]andinvivomousemodels[49].Theseinvestigationsprovide empirical support for the significance and functional relevance of the proposed target pathways.

## 4.2 Proteomics

To increase our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying these cellular events during injury and repair, a label-free proteomics strategy was used to assess differences in protein expression and phosphorylation in semi-quantitative manner over time [46]. Of the 2562 identified proteins, 239 proteins were significantly altered during intestinal IR. By means of hierarchical clustering, four clusters were identified reflecting distinct temporal patterns. Proteins that showed a lower abundance throughout the reperfusion period were enriched for GO terms related to intestinal digestion/absorption (such as IFABP, LCT, ANPEP, NAALADL1, and SLC5A1), microvillus (VIL1, EZR, ESPN, PLS1, CDHR2, MYO1A, and MYO7B), and cell junction (cadherins CDH1, CDH17 and cadherin-related proteins CDHR5, CDHR2). Interestingly, IFABP and VIL1 are known to leak from the enterocytes towards the systemic circulation [53] and are currently investigated as clinical diagnostic markers in the context of mesenteric ischemia [54]. Other proteins in this cluster could be further explored for their diagnostic potential. Conversely, proteins showing a sustained increase in abundance throughout the reperfusion period were predominantly associated with the innate immune response, in particular the complement (C3, C5, C6, C8B) and coagulation pathway (PROS1, F2). In addition, various proteins in this cluster were involved in an extracellular matrix organization, including COL15A1, COL18A1, FBN1, NID2, ITGA, and JAM3 [46].

Surgically obtained clinical samples of the study of Jiang et al. were also investigated using proteomics technologies, and also here, the study focused on the ischemic samples attributed to arterial blockade as compared to control [48]. A total of 5230 proteins were identified in this sample set, of which 417 proteins were found to be differentially expressed. GO analysis revealed the involvement of immune-related pathways, tight junction, focal adhesion, cAMP signaling pathway for upregulated proteins, and metabolic processes for downregulated proteins. Of the differentially expressed proteins, only 15appearedtooverlapwiththestudyofKipetal.,ofwhich10proteins displayed consistent directional changes; specifically, CD163, GSTM2, LIMS2, RAB23, TGFB1I1, TMEM109, and TUBA1C were upregulated, while CISD1, EPS15, and MEP1B were downregulated in both studies. Despite the observed substantial overlap in the transcriptome profiles between the two studies, it is remarkable that only limited overlap was evident at the proteome level. We need, however, to acknowledge that the human model is standardized and only investigates the early effects of ischemia-reperfusion, while the clinical samples that were harvested probably experienced longer and variable periods of ischemia. In addition, the number of differentially expressed proteins was nearly one-tenth of the number of differentially expressed genes, and there is a wide interindividual variability while the sample size of both studies was rather low. Nevertheless, it reveals once again the complexity of molecular events taking place during IR injury.

## 4.2.1 Phosphoproteomics

To add another layer of complexity, protein functionality and signaling networks are determined by the coincident occurrence of numerous rapid phosphorylation events. This post-translational modification serves as a central mechanism by which signal transduction pathways coordinate a wide range of protein functions, including modulating PPIs, enzyme activity, and protein stability. Collectively, these phosphorylation-mediated processes support fundamental biological functions such as cell cycle regulation, cell survival, and energy metabolism. LC-MS/MS analysis of the samples of the human experimental IR model identified and quantified 1802 phosphosites derived from 1214 proteins (whole phosphoproteome), of which 90% were phosphoserines, 9.8% phosphothreonines, and 0.2% phosphotyrosines. In total, 305 phosphosites on 162 proteins showed a significant change during IR, of which putative substrates of several MAP kinases and CDKs [46]. Remarkably, in contrast to the global proteome where changes occurred primarily during reperfusion, phosphorylation changes occurred already directly following ischemia. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that differentially phosphorylated proteins were involved in the regulation of mRNA processing and RNA splicing, supramolecular fiber organization/cytoskeleton, and cell junction organization. Specifically, when studying phosphosites with a known functionality (using PTM-SEA), it appeared that during reperfusion, a high number of phosphosites was related to growth factor response (EGF signature), as well as cell division (CDK1 and CDK2

signatures). Interestingly, 22 proteins differed both in phosphorylation status as well as abundance and the change in phosphorylation status appearedtoprecedethechangeinabundance(mostlydownregulation) for most of the proteins.

In conclusion, the dynamic landscape of phosphorylation events highlights the central role of post-translational modifications in coordinating fundamental biological functions. These phosphorylation-mediated processes, often occurring prior to changes in protein abundance, influence cell regulation, including growth factor responses and cell division. This interplay underscores the complexity of cellular signaling networks in the context of intestinal IR injury.

## 4.2.2 Spatial proteomics

It becomes increasingly evident that the tissue microenvironment plays a pivotal role in shaping the molecular responses to IR injury. The rapid and profound alterations in tissue composition induced by IR, including phenomena such as enterocyte loss [55], alterations in Paneth cells [56, 57], and goblet cells [58], and infiltration of neutrophils [9], have a severe impact on transcriptomic and proteomic dynamicsatawholetissuelevelandemphasizetheneedtoincorporate a spatial component into the analytical framework. Spatial proteomics, with its ability to unravel the spatial distribution of proteins within tissues, emerges as a crucial avenue for understanding the spatiotemporal dynamics of molecular events. A recent review described the advances in LC-MS-based analysis of proteins down to the level of single cells, with applications on cells in suspension or disaggregated from tissues before analysis, thereby losing the all-important spatial context of each single cell, to applications on tissue sections where cellular context is preserved [59]. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometryimaging (MSI) was applied in the established human intestinal IR model with a sample size of 9 to capture spatially resolved proteomic information over time, utilizing tissue sections. Distinct regions of interest (such as mucosa and submucosa) were selected for histological annotation to identify region-specific IR-induced protein changes [46]. During IR, significant changes in intensity were observed for 154 and 185 m z / values in the mucosa and submucosa, respectively. To link MALDITOF MSI data to LC-MS/MS protein identifications, MALDI-FTICR MSI measurements were conducted as an intermediate step to obtain more accurate peptides mass descriptions. Alignment of these accurate m z / values with LC-MS/MS (phospho)-proteome data facilitated the annotation of a mere 10 proteins for the mucosa and 11 proteins for the submucosa. This outcome underscores that, despite significant recent advancements, the technology still faces challenges in extracting comprehensive findings. Nevertheless, these identified proteins were found to be involved in processes that were overrepresented among the differentially expressed proteins identified by whole tissue LC-MS/MS analysis. Examples include C5 and C7, components of the complement cascade, as well as COL1A2, which plays a role in extracellular matrix organization.

## 5 RECENT BREAKTHROUGHS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS IN INTESTINAL IR-FROM TARGETS TO TREATMENT

## 5.1 Exosome omics

In total, three studies applied omics technologies on exosomes in the context of intestinal IR [23, 60, 61]. Exosomes are small (nanoscale) extracellular vesicles that are released from all cells in the body, which carry molecular cargo such as RNAs (mRNA, miRNA, lncRNA, circRNA, and rRNA), proteins, and lipids, playing a key role in intercellular communication. They are also regarded as valuable circulating biomarkers for various diseases. Understanding the content and function of exosomes in this context presents a promising opportunity for uncovering new mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets in the treatment of intestinal IR injury.

In the first study, exosomes were isolated from mesenteric lymph (collected across three distinct phases: 1-h pre-ischemia, 1-h reperfusion, and 2-h reperfusion) during intestinal IR in a rat model. Following lipid extraction, a lipidomic analysis was conducted using LC-ESI-MS/MS, resulting in the identification of lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) and PC species. An increasing trend was observed in the level of PCs containing saturated fatty acids, whereas levels of LPCs containing unsaturated fatty acids (LPC18:2 and LPC20:4) were significantly higher in post-IR exosomes. These specific LPCs showed a concentration-dependent increase in NF-kB expression of monocytes indicating biological activity [60]. The same group assessed profiles of proteins, microRNA, and lipids in exosomes derived from an in vitro cell model [61]. Human intestinal Caco-2 cells were exposed to HR after which exosomes were isolated from the conditioned medium. Proteome analysis revealed over 3000 identified proteins isolated from the exosomes for both the control and HR conditions, resulting in 110 proteins with a higher expression and 75 proteins with a lower expression in HR as compared to control. Proteins found to be upregulated in exosomes following HR included those involved in complement activation (C3 and C5), metabolism (ATP-citrate synthase, fatty acid synthase, nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase, glycogen synthase, etc.), and pre-mRNA processing. Analysis of miRNAs revealed marginal changes in expression of hsa-miR-21-5p, hsa-miR-23a-3p, hsa-miR124-3p, and hsa-miR-30d-5p, whereas lipidomic analysis revealed a decrease in the levels of free fatty acids arachidonic, docosahexaenoic, and stearic acid, and an increase in levels of unsaturated fatty acidcontaining LPCs 16:1, 8:1, and 20:1 in exosomes of HR-exposed Caco-2 cells [61].

Zhang et al. performed circRNAs sequencing on intestinal tissue exosomes collected from mice with intestinal IR and demonstrated 20 circRNAs to be differentially expressed compared with shamoperated controls [23]. Four of the top-five differentially expressed circRNAs were confirmed through another method and were found to be regulated in a similar way in mouse plasma exosomes. Exosomal circEZH\_005 was the most altered circRNA and was validated to be significantly downregulated within the early hours of intestinal IR

injury in mice. This circRNA was also found to be reduced in the plasma of cardiac surgery patients who developed postoperative intestinal IR injury and correlated negatively with plasma IFABP. circEZH2\_005 was demonstrated to be highly expressed in jejunal crypt cells where its expression was markedly decreased after IR, and in vitro studies showed that it protected mouse intestinal organoids from HR injury. circRNAs can interact with numerous proteins and are known to participate in disease regulation. Mechanistic studies revealed that circEZH2\_005 upregulation promotes Lgr5 + stem cells proliferation by direct interaction with hnRNPA1, and enhanced Gprc5a stability, thereby alleviating IR-induced intestinal mucosal damage. In conclusion, this exosome omics study nicely illustrates the potential of circRNAs as biomarkers and provides new avenues for combatting intestinal IR injury.

## 5.2 Single-cell omics

To comprehensively map the alterations in cellular heterogeneity, an animal study was recently conducted, utilizing single-cell (sc) RNA-seq analysis to investigate changes in the overall landscape and temporal heterogeneity of intestinal cells during intestinal IR injury [22]. Four groups of mice were compared: control mice, sham mice, and mice exposed to 45 min of ischemia followed by 90 min (90-min R) or 12 h of reperfusion (12-h R). Bulk RNA-seq analysis as well as scRNA-seq (using the 10x Genomics platform) of jejunal segments were performed. Enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes between90-minRandcontrolrevealedthattheexpressiondifferences in GO terms 'regulating of transcription,' 'response to lipopolysaccharide,' 'response to mechanical stimulus,' 'inflammatory response,' 'neutrophil chemotaxis,' 'response to hypoxia,' and 'cell migration' were the most significant. During later stage reperfusion (12-h R), GO terms related to adaptive immunity also appeared to be enriched, 'B cell activation' and 'T cell receptor signaling pathway' appeared in the term list. Performing scRNA-seq analysis of all four groups resulted in the identification of nine major cell type clusters: B cells and plasma cells (BCs), dendritic cells (DCs) and tuft cells, enterocyte cells (ECs), enteroendocrine fibroblasts (EFs), goblet cells (GCs), Paneth cells (PCs), stem cells (SCs), T cells (TCs), and transit-amplifying cells (TACs). Intestinal IR injury-induced changes in these cell types, and potentially associated transcription factors were identified within each distinct cell type. For each cell type, a number of subpopulations were identified (10 subpopulations for ECs, nine for TACs, four for PCs, seven for GCs, 13 for TCs). The number of cells in several major cell-type clusters drastically changed during IR, with the advent of new subpopulations over time. For instance, for ECs, a drastic reduction was found at 90min R, which restored again during prolonged reperfusion. Improved survival rate for three EC subpopulations was found at 90-min R, which showed enrichment for biological processes 'positive regulation of cell migration,' 'cell adhesion,' 'translation,' 'protein folding,' and 'antigen processing.' At 12-h R, the EC number was restored, and several new subpopulations were observed of which all appeared to be involved in metabolic processes such as 'oxidative phosphorylation,' 'biosynthe-

sis of amino acids,' 'fat digestion and absorption.' Interestingly, the number of PCs greatly increased at 90-min R, and this increase was apparent for three out of four subpopulations. Analysis of these three subpopulations showed enrichment in biological processes 'detection of misfolded protein,' 'defense response to bacterium,' and 'humoral immune response,' amongst others. During IR injury, the number of a subpopulation of GCs was substantially increased at 90-min R. These GCs were identified by marker genes, including C1qbp, Ifitm2, and Atad3a, which are involved in inflammation and infection. Furthermore, changes in TACs and TCs during intestinal IR were also mapped and yielded novel insights as described in detail [22]. TACs appeared to be the main source of ECs, which were significantly increased at 90-min R. Analysis of differentiation trends, cell gene characteristics, and cell function demonstrated that most TACs are in the stage of proliferation and differentiation and do not have specific functions [22].

In the latter bioinformatic analysis, cell-cell communication was assessed at the different stages of intestinal IR injury; at 90min R, the communication between SCs and fibroblast appeared higher, while communication between DCs was the highest at 12h R. This comprehensive assessment of cellular heterogeneity and the emergence of distinct cell subpopulations presents promising avenues for redefining therapeutic strategies in the context of IR injury.

## 5.3 Organoid omics

As indicated above, HR-exposed intestinal mouse and human organoids have been successfully used for the validation of potential targets that were identified by transcriptomic analysis [23, 45]. However, these organoids could also be used to search for novel epithelial-derived targets by omics technologies. So far, two articles employed omics technologies in intestinal organoids in the context of intestinal IR [62, 63]. Kip et al. employed proteomics analysis on human intestinal organoids from three individual patients. These organoids were differentiated into villus-like and crypt-like phenotypes, allowing the distinction of unique cellular responses analogous to those observed in vivo in human intestinal IR [44]. Proteomic analysis revealed substantial changes in the villus-like human small intestinal organoids that supported the presence of enterocytes and goblet cells. This was further corroborated by staining and the expression of validated marker genes. Functional enrichment analysis of significantly changed proteins during HR revealed that processes related to mitochondrial metabolism and organization, lipid metabolism, and the immune response ('neutrophil degradation' and 'antigen presentation') were altered in both organoid phenotypes. Changes in protein metabolism, as well as mitophagy pathway and protection against oxidative stress, were more pronounced in crypt-like organoids, whereas cellular stress and cell death-associated protein changes were more pronounced in villus-like organoids. Profile analysis underscored certain interesting proteins showing a consistent temporal profile during HR in each organoid phenotype. For instance, PIGR

and DMBT1 exhibited heightened expression levels, particularly after extended reoxygenation, specifically in the crypt-like phenotypes. Comparing the changed proteins of the human in vitro organoid HR model with those of the human in vivo intestinal IR model revealed 22 overlapping proteins. Of special interest are ACE2 and DPP4 (both decreased), and NID2 and SQSTM1 (both increased) as a result of IR in vivo and HR in vitro [46, 62]. In this regard, it would also be worthwhile to compare the comprehensive list of all expressed proteins of both models, to delineate shared processes and pathways, affirming the relevance of the human organoid model and to elucidate necessary adjustments to enhance the validity of the human intestinal organoid model by incorporating essential components.

Arecent study showcased a microfluidic mouse intestinal organoidon-a-chip with incorporated artificial microvessels (loaded with human umbilical vein endothelial cells) [63]. Perfusion of these microvessels with culture medium with a low oxygen concentration induced a hypoxic state within 3 h, whereas conventional culture methods often require up to 24 h in a hypoxic chamber. Subsequent reoxygenation for 1 h was achieved by perfusion of the microvessels with normoxic culture medium. RNA-seq was performed on harvested mouse intestinal organoids from the chip treated with normoxia or HR. Genes that were upregulated due to HR exposure included Selenbp1, Gbe1, Egr1, Notch3, Ndrg1, Aldoc, Pgm2; downregulated genes included Card11, Ddit4, Syde2, Impdh2, Serinc3. Interestingly, the expression of Olfm4, a known stem cell marker, showed the most substantial decrease. The authors pursued this finding and demonstrated that overexpression of Olfm4 in HR-exposed organoids countered an inflammatory response. In an in vivo intestinal IR mouse model, overexpression of Olfm4 by intraperitoneal injection of lentivirus with Olfm4 transcript resulted in reduced intestinal damage and mitigated inflammation [63]. In conclusion, these findings support the relevance of the biomimetic organoid-on-a-chip model in identifying novel treatment targets for managing intestinal IR injury.

Beyond their value as models for understanding intestinal IR, organoids exhibit promising potential for therapeutic applications. In a recent study, treating mice exposed to IR with intestinal organoids led to a significant improvement in their survival rates, promoted stem cell self-renewal, and regulated the immune microenvironment [64]. Lamina propria macrophages were found to be responsible for the alleviation of intestinal IR injury by intestinal organoids. In pursuit of understanding the protective mechanism, an untargeted LC-MS metabolomic analysis was conducted on the conditioned medium from the organoids, unveiling a top list of 35 differentially expressed metabolites when compared to the control medium. Furthermore, a similar analysis on the cecal contents of organoid-transplanted and control mice after IR highlighted a set of 'consensus' metabolites, pinpointing L-malic acid as a potential protective agent. Further investigations demonstrated that L-malic acid secreted by organoids during engraftment mediated M2 macrophage polarization in a SOCS2dependent manner, offering new insights into the mechanism underlying the role played by organoids transplantation therapy in treating intestinal IR injury [64].

## 6 OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES OF OMICS TECHNOLOGIES FOR CLINICAL APPLICATION

## 6.1 Multi-omics data integration in intestinal IR

As demonstrated in this review, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and metagenomics offer comprehensive insights into the transcriptional, protein, metabolic, and microbial alterations that occur during intestinal IR injury and can lead to therapeutic and biomarker target discovery to be further explored for application in clinical practice. However, to fully grasp the complexity of intestinal IR Injury, integrating data from multiple omics disciplines is essential. Integrative omics approaches empower researchers to create molecular networks and pinpoint key regulatory nodes that drive intestinal IR injury. A comprehensive review outlined data integration strategies in translational medicine to enhance the functional interpretation of multi-omics datasets with the specific objectives of detecting disease-associated patterns, identifying subtypes, and understanding regulatory processes [65]. Importantly, while these strategies have found applicability in various fields, their implementation in the intestinal IR field is virtually absent. A logical first step is to generate and integrate quantitative LC-MS/MS proteome and metabolome data of consecutively sampled tissue and blood from the human intestinal IR model (control, only ischemia, short an prolonged reperfusion) with scRNA-seq data of the same tissue samples over time to capture temporally dynamic transcriptome-proteome-metabolome correlation networks to further unravel the complex molecular landscape associated with the induction of ischemia, both locally in the intestine and in the blood.

## 6.2 Enhancing human organoid models

Organoids bridge the gap between conventional cell cultures and in vivo models. Human organoids offer enhanced manipulability compared to the human in vivo model and improved translational relevance over conventional cultures by better replicating the original tissue's cellular diversity, architecture, and functionality. We and others showed that exposure of organoids to HR mimicked properties of the in vivo response to IR exposure [45, 63]. These organoid models enable the study of the epithelial component of IR, and the human organoid model enables the separate investigation of the intestinal crypt, housing stem cells crucial for epithelial regeneration, and the intestinal villus, containing mature cells that are more vulnerable to IR injury [62]. However, it is essential to acknowledge that the interplay between the epithelium, microbes in the intestinal lumen, and immune cells is central to the pathophysiology of intestinal IR injury. To explore this interaction, co-culturing organoids with immune cells or luminal factors in future studies is essential. The multi-omics data-including changes in transcriptional states of specific cell types during intestinal IR injury and repair by scRNA-seq-will provide valuable input to

identify relevant (subpopulations of) cells and factors in vivo, enabling the landscape of human intestinal IR injury and repair to be reconstructedinadvancedmicrofluidichumanorganoidculturesystemsthat offer more controllable conditions and higher throughput for functional screens of identified targets using bioengineering approaches [66].

## 6.3 Expediting clinical translation

The animal and human intestinal IR studies discussed in this review enhanced our molecular understanding of the sequential stages of progressive ischemic injury, reperfusion injury and initiation of repair mechanisms. By comprehensive analysis of alterations in thousands of genes and proteins, valuable insights have been gained into the coordinated biological processes during intestinal IR (see graphical overview in Figure 1C). These findings pave the way for further investigations into potential therapeutic targets, with the goal of reducing harmful processes, enhancing protective mechanisms, and facilitating tissue regeneration. While promising protective effects of modulating these targets have been observed in animal models and organoids, clinical translation of these therapies in the context of intestinal IR remains pending. This could be attributed to the acute nature of mesenteric ischemic injury in patients, which often requires immediate (surgical) intervention. This setting makes it challenging to test therapeutic strategies in a controlled manner without raising ethical concerns. Moreover, rather than exclusively focusing on IR, it is imperative to address the issue at its origin by thoroughly examining the coordinated metabolic response to ischemia. Studies in other organs have revealed that the accumulation of metabolites (in particular, the citric acid cycle intermediate succinate) is responsible for mitochondrial ROS production during reperfusion [67]. Hence, proper metabolic control during the ischemic phase could be a promising avenue to inhibit subsequent reperfusion injury, a mechanism that should be further explored in humanintestinal ischemia.

## 7 CONCLUSION

As our investigation into the molecular complexities of intestinal IR injury progresses, utilizing omics technologies, we expect promising opportunities for future research. First, further integrating multi-omics approaches, combining transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and metagenomics, will provide a more profound understanding of the complex interplay between the host, gut microbiota, and the injured intestinal tissue. This holistic perspective will facilitate the identification of key regulatory nodes driving intestinal IR injury, leading to valuable therapeutic targets. Furthermore, the emergence of single-cell omics techniques will enable the careful dissection of cellular heterogeneity within the intestinal milieu, uncovering specialized subpopulations involved in injury and repair processes in humans. Together with addressing the metabolic events of the ischemic phase

and utilizing the therapeutic potential of organoids, clinical translation seems within reach in the years to come.
