Neutrophils use immunoglobulins to clear antigen, but their role in immunoglobulin production is unknown. Here we identified neutrophils around the marginal zone (MZ) of the spleen, a B cell area specialized in T cell  -  independent immunoglobulin responses to circulating antigen. Neutrophils colonized peri-MZ areas after postnatal mucosal colonization by microbes and enhanced their B cell  -  helper function after receiving reprogramming signals, including interleukin 10 (IL-10), from splenic sinusoidal endothelial cells. Splenic neutrophils induced immunoglobulin class switching, somatic hypermutation and antibody production by activating MZ B cells through a mechanism that involved the cytokines BAFF, APRIL and IL-21. Neutropenic patients had fewer and hypomutated MZ B cells and a lower abundance of preimmune immunoglobulins to T cell  -  independent antigens, which indicates that neutrophils generate an innate layer of antimicrobial immunoglobulin defense by interacting with MZ B cells.

Neutrophils are the first cells of the immune response to migrate to sites of infection and inflammation to eliminate microbes and necrotic cells   . 1 After sensing conserved molecular signatures associated with microbes and tissue damage, neutrophils activate defensive programs that promote phagocytosis, intracellular degradation, extracellular discharge of antimicrobial factors and the formation of neutrophil extracellular

traps (NETs)   . These structures arise after cell death and consist of 2 decondensed chromatin embedded with granular and cytoplasmic proteins that trap and kill microbes    . Neutrophils also release cytokines and 3 chemokines that recruit monocytes to optimize antigen clearance   . 4

The long-held view that neutrophils function exclusively in the innate phase of the immune response has been challenged by studies

showing that neutrophils also influence adaptive immunity by interacting with dendritic cells (DCs)    . These cells of the innate immune 5 response present antigen to T cells after undergoing further maturation in response to neutrophil-derived cytokines such as tumor necrosis  factor (TNF)    . Neutrophils also release interleukin-12 (IL-12), 6 which promotes the polarization of naive T cells into inflammatory T helper type 1 cells that release interferon-   (IFN-    )    . In the presence γ γ 2 of IFN-   and other inflammatory cytokines, neutrophils also upregγ ulate their expression of antigen-loading major histocompatibility class-II molecules to acquire DC-like antigen-presenting function    . 2

Although there is growing evidence that neutrophils have an effect on the induction of T cell responses during infection, additional data have shown that neutrophils suppress T cell activation in the context of  pregnancy and cancer    . Indeed, neutrophils are equipped with 2 enzymatic systems such as inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and arginase that suppress T cells by generating nitrogen intermediates and depleting extracellular arginine, respectively    . Neutrophils 7 would further regulate adaptive immunity by secreting IL-10 after sensing bacteria through Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and C-type lectin receptors    . Thus, neutrophils can either potentiate or down-modulate 8 T cell responses in a context-dependent manner.

Neutrophils further crosstalk with the adaptive immune system by binding to B cell  -  derived immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgA on opsonized microbes  , 9 10 The ensuing activation of Fc   and Fc . γ α receptors regulates neutrophil effector functions    . Notably, neutrophils also 1 produce the cytokine BAFF (BLyS) and the proliferation-inducing ligand  APRIL,  which  are  two  TLR-inducible  B  cell  -  stimulating factors related to the ligand for the T cell molecule CD40 (CD40L) 11  -  14 . In addition to promoting the survival and differentiation of B cells and immunoglobulin-secreting plasma cells  1  -  14   , BAFF and APRIL 1 trigger IgM production and class switching from IgM to IgG or IgA independently of CD40L  15  -  18 .  This  T cell  -  independent (TI) pathway would enable antigen-sampling DCs and other cells of the innate immune response to enhance B cell responses at mucosal surfaces inhabited by commensal bacteria  9   . 1

TI immunoglobulin responses also occur in the marginal zone (MZ) of the spleen, a B cell area positioned at the interface between the circulation and the immune system  0, 2 21 .  B cells dwelling in the MZ are in a state of active readiness that enables them to mount prompt immunoglobulin responses to blood-borne antigens via a pathway that does not require a T cell  -  dependent (TD) germinal-center reaction 20  -  22 .  Although some MZ B cell responses may occur after translocation of commensal antigens across intact mucosal surfaces 20,21,23  -  26 , others occur after systemic invasion by mucosal pathogens  0, 2 21 .  In humans, MZ B cells have a circulating counterpart, contain mutated immunoglobulin genes and express surface IgM and IgD together with the memory molecule CD27 (refs.   21,27,28). These MZ B cells are different from hypermutated IgM   memory B cells, which emerge + from a canonical germinal-center reaction and express surface IgM and CD27 but not IgD  22   . The role of neutrophils in B cell activation and immunoglobulin production is unknown, but published studies show that these granulocytes home to the MZ in response to bloodborne bacteria 29 .

We show here that neutrophils colonized peri-MZ areas of the spleen in the absence of infection via a noninflammatory pathway that became more prominent after postnatal mucosal colonization by bacteria. Splenic neutrophils had a phenotype distinct from that of circulating neutrophils, formed MZ B cell  -  interacting NET-like structures, and elicited immunoglobulin class switching, somatic hypermutation and antibody production by activating MZ B cells via a mechanism that involved BAFF and APRIL and the cytokine IL-21. Circulating

neutrophils acquired B cell  -  helper function after exposure to splenic sinusoidal endothelial cells (SECs), releasing cytokines dependent on the transcription factor STAT3, such as IL-10, in response to microbial signals. Patients with congenital neutropenia had fewer and hypomutated MZ B cells and less production of preimmune immunoglobulins reactive to TI antigens. Thus, neutrophils may generate an innate layer of antimicrobial immunoglobulin defense by undergoing MZ B cell  -  helper reprogramming in the spleen.

## RESULTS

## Neutrophils colonize peri-MZ areas

T o determine whether neutrophils interact with B cells under homeostatic conditions, we obtained lymphoid organs from people with no inflammation or infection and stained the organs for the B cell molecule CD20 and for the granulocytic enzyme myeloperoxidase by immunohistochemistry. Peripheral lymph nodes, tonsils and intestinal Peyer  '  s patches contained no or few neutrophils, whereas we detected some neutrophils in the perifollicular area of mesenteric lymph nodes ( Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 1 . Unexpectedly, we ) detected even more neutrophils in the perifollicular area of spleens that  had  no  histological  alterations  ( Fig.  1a and Supplementary Fig. 2a . As shown by light microscopy, fluorescence microscopy and ) confocal microscopy, splenic neutrophils expressed typical granulocyte molecules such as elastase, myeloperoxidase and the adhesion molecule CD15 and formed projections that interacted with outer MZ and perifollicular B cells with low expression of IgD ( Fig. 1b c , and Supplementary Fig. 2b . Splenic neutrophils were also proximal to ) perifollicular SECs expressing the lectin mannose receptor and the coagulation protein von Willebrand factor, macrophages expressing the glycoprotein CD68 and the haptoglobulin receptor CD163, and DCs expressing the integrin CD11c.

Consistent with their possible role in homeostasis, we also detected perifollicular neutrophils in spleens from healthy rhesus macaques and mice ( Supplementary Fig. 3a .  Simian neutrophils expressed ) elastase and were positioned between MZ B cells and red-pulp SECs, whereas  mouse  neutrophils  expressed  the  granulocyte  molecule Ly6G and surrounded a MZ area containing B cells weakly positive for IgD and macrophages strongly positive for the sialoadhesin receptor MOMA-1. Another indication of the role of neutrophils in homeostasis was provided by analysis of spleens from patients with systemic inflammatory or infectious disorders, including systemic lupus erythematosus, hyper-IgD syndrome (an autoinflammatory disorder), infection with human immunodeficiency virus and sepsis. In these pathological spleens, neutrophils lost the selective perifollicular topography usually observed in normal spleens and instead extensively infiltrated follicular mantle and germinal-center areas populated by B cells strongly positive and negative for IgD, respectively ( Fig. 1d e , and Supplementary Fig. 3b ). The aberrant topography of splenic neutrophils in inflamed spleens was associated with partial or complete loss of the MZ. Thus, neutrophils colonized splenic peri-MZ areas but not follicular areas under homeostatic conditions.

## Neutrophils have MZ B cell  -  helper function

Flow  cytometry,  light  microscopy  and  electron  microscopy  did not  demonstrate  gross  morphological  and  ultrastructural  differences between circulating and splenic neutrophils ( Supplementary Fig. 4a b , . Neutrophils amounted to 10  %  , 2  %  , 0.5  % and 0.3  % of total ) cells in spleens, mesenteric lymph nodes, peripheral lymph nodes and tonsils, respectively. MZ B cells coexpressing IgD and the memory molecule CD27 were more abundant in spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes than in other lymphoid tissues and had high expression of the

complement receptor CD21 ( Fig. 1f , Supplementary Fig. 4c and data not shown). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) demonstrated induction of IgM secretion by MZ B cells exposed to splenic neutro  phils  but  not  by  those  exposed  to  circulating  neutrophils ( Fig.  1g ; ) we  therefore  called  these    '  B  cell  -  helper  neutrophils  ' (N BH  cells) and   '  conventional neutrophils  ' (N   cells), respectively. C Priming with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) did not augment the IgMinducing function of N BH  cells ( Fig. 1g ), which suggested pre-existing activation. Viability assays indicated that the enhanced IgM-  inducing function of N BH   cells  did  not  depend  on  their  ability  to  promote better MZ B cell survival than that promoted by N   cells ( C Fig. 1h . ) Accordingly, the apoptosis of N BH  cells was equivalent to that of N C cells in long-term coculture despite their better survival in short-term monocultures ( Supplementary Fig. 5a . )

N  BH cells activated MZ B cells more effectively and more rapidly than follicular naive B cells through both contact-dependent and contactindependent  mechanisms  ( Fig.  1i and Supplementary  Fig.  5b . ) The functional prominence of N BH  cells was documented by the finding that they activated MZ B cells as effectively as splenic CD4   T cells + did and more effectively than splenic macrophages or DCs did ( Fig. 1j . ) The functional specificity of N BH  cells was emphasized by their ability to induce contact-independent suppression of the proliferation of CD4    + T cells that were activated via the T cell antigen receptor molecule CD3 and the cytokine IL-2 ( Fig. 1k . Thus, N ) BH  cells functioned

as professional MZ B cell  -  helper cells and may suppress T cells to induce immunoglobulin responses in a TI manner.

## Neutrophils induce immunoglobulin diversification

Confocal microscopy and wide-field microscopy showed that N BH cells  expressing  elastase,  CD15  and  the  granulocytic  microbial receptor CEACAM-1 formed DNA-containing NET-like projections that were in close contact with B cells expressing IgD ( Fig. 2a and Supplementary Video 1 ). Outer MZ and perifollicular N BH  cells had more abundant projections than red pulp N BH  cells had and often interacted  with  B  cells  expressing  the  DNA-editing  enzyme  AID ( Fig. 2b c , ),  a hallmark of ongoing immunoglobulin gene diversification in germinal-center and some extrafollicular B cells 16,17,30,31 . Quantitative  RT-PCR  showed  that  MZ  B  cells  had  more AICDA mRNA (encoding AID) than naive B cells had, but had less AICDA than germinal center B cells had, and demonstrated that MZ B cells upregulated AICDA after exposure to N BH  cells but not after exposure to N   cells ( C Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig. 6a b , . )

We used RT-PCR and Southern blot analysis to study class-switch recombination  (CSR),  a  process  that  provides  immunoglobulins with new effector functions by replacing the heavy-chain constant region  of  IgM  with  that  of  IgG  or  IgA  without  changing  antigen pecificity s 30 Consistent with their higher AID expression, some MZ . B cells   constitutively expressed germline     -chain intervening region γ

As shown by ELISA, quantitative RT-PCR, flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy, N BH  cells stimulated MZ B cells to produce IgA and IgG, including more IgG2 than IgG1 ( Fig. 2e f , ). This effect was not elicited by N   cells, occurred more effectively in MZ B cells than C naive B cells, and correlated with the induction of PRDM1 and XBP1 mRNA (which encode the plasma cell  -  associated proteins Blimp-1 and  XBP-1,  respectively)  and  with  the  generation  of  plasma  cells expressing the activation molecule CD38 but not CD20 ( Fig. 2g h , and Supplementary Fig. 6c . Finally, we used DNA cloning and sequencing ) to study somatic hypermutation (SHM), a process that mutates variable (V)-diversity-joining exons that encoded the antigen-binding V region

of immunoglobulins  0   . Although it typically occurs in germinal-center 3 B cells, SHM also targets MZ B cells, at least in humans 21 In the pres-. ence of N BH  cells, MZ B cells   accumulated more mutations in the variable heavy-chain (V    ) V    3-23 gene ( H H Fig. 2i ), which is often used by MZ B cells  1   . Thus, N 2 BH  cells may stimulate MZ B cells to undergo SHM in addition to CSR and plasma cell differentiation.

## Neutrophils include two MZ B cell  -  helper subsets

We used flow cytometry, electron microscopy, light microscopy, widefield microscopy, confocal microscopy, quantitative RT-PCR arrays, ELISA, annexin V assays and TUNEL assay (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end-labeling) to further characterize N BH cells. We identified two distinct subsets of N BH  cells (N BH1  and N BH2   ) on the basis of various parameters, including their relative expression of CD15 and CD16. Similar to N   cells, N C BH  cells had typical granulocytic physical features and expressed canonical granulocytic molecules such as CD15 and the Fc   receptor CD16 ( γ Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. 7a ). However, whereas N   cells had high expression of CD15 and C CD16, N BH1  cells had intermediate expression of CD15 and CD16 and N  BH2 cells low expression of CD15 and CD16. Relative to expression

Despite their morphological and ultrastructural similarity to N BH2   cells,  N BH1   were more activated than N BH2   cells,  as  they  had  higher  expression  of CD27, CD40L, CD86, CD95 and HLA-II but lower expression of CD24 ( Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. 7b c , . That observation correlated ) with the persistence of N BH1   cells  but  not  N BH2   cells  in  inflamed spleens with a hypoplastic MZ ( Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. 8 . )

Relative to mRNA abundance in N   cells, N C BH1  and N BH2  cells had more abundant mRNA for B cell  -  stimulating molecules such as BAFF, APRIL, CD40L and IL-21 (refs.   19,35,36),  B  cell  chemo  attractants such as CXCL12 and CXCL13 (ref.   19), immuno  activating receptors and  cytokines  such  as  TLR7,  TLR8,  IL-1    ,  IL-6,  IL-8,  IL-12  and β TNF  1,2,4,6 and immunoregulatory molecules such as IL-10, the IL-10 , receptor, arginase 1, RALDH1, iNOS, IDO, SOCS1, progranulin and SLPI  ,32,33,37  -  39 1 ( Fig. 3b and Supplementary Fig. 9 ). W e confirmed the presence of mRNA for CD40L in N BH  cells, but its expression was lower in N BH  cells than in splenic CD4   T cells ( + Supplementary Fig. 10 . ) Consistent with their enhanced activation state, N BH1  cells had higher expression of much of the mRNA noted above than N BH2  cells had and

had more mRNA for the antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-2, Bcl-x   and mcl-1, L but less mRNA for the proapoptotic proteins Bad and Bak1 (ref.   40).

N  BH1 and N BH2  cells induced more AICDA mRNA and more production of IgM, IgG and IgA in MZ B cells than did N   cells ( C Fig. 3c ). Despite their worse survival, N BH2  cells had stronger MZ B cell  -  helper activity than N BH1  cells had ( Fig. 3c d , , which was probably due to ) the release of more soluble BAFF, APRIL and IL-21 by N BH2  cells than by N BH1  cells ( Fig. 4a b , . N ) BH2  cells may have also established firmer and more extensive interactions with MZ B cells via post-apoptotic NETs. Consistent with that possibility and with their heightened activation state, N BH  cells spontaneously formed NET-like projections, whereas N   cells did not ( C Supplementary Fig. 11 and Supplementary Video  2 .  Moreover,  apoptotic  TUNEL    N ) + BH   cells,  which  probably  corresponded  to  annexin  V  -  positive  N BH2   cells,  occupied mainly perifollicular areas adjacent to MZ B cells ( Supplementary Fig. 12a b , ). Thus, N BH  cells included N BH1  and N BH2  subsets that were more activated and had more B cell  -  helper and regulatory properties than N   cells had. C

Blocking BAFF with soluble BAFF-R  -  immunoglobulin had a similar inhibitory effect. We used N BH  cell  -  conditioned medium for these experiments because immunoglobulin-containing decoy receptors may activate N BH  cells via Fc   receptors. Finally, patients with delγ eterious substitutions in TACI or STAT3 (a protein that drives signals from multiple cytokines, including IL-21)  5  had poor MZ develop3 ment and fewer circulating MZ B cells ( Fig. 4f g , ). These data indicated that N BH  cells activated MZ B cells by a mechanism involving BAFF, APRIL and IL-21.

## Splenic signals reprogram neutrophils

Given the close interaction of N BH  cells with SECs, we wondered whether N   cells acquire B cell  -  helper function in response to SECC derived signals. Such signals may include IL-10, a cytokine that confers regulatory properties to neutrophils    . Fluorescence microscopy, 8 confocal microscopy and flow cytometry showed IL-10 expression by perifollicular SECs that expressed the adhesion protein CD31, the coagulation protein von Willebrand factor, the lymphoid protein CD8 and mannose receptor ( Fig. 5a and Supplementary Fig. 14a    c -   ). As shown by quantitative RT-PCR and ELISA, SECs upregulated expression  of  IL-10-encoding  mRNA  and  the  secretion  of  IL-10 in  response  to  microbial  TLR  ligands  such  as  LPS  ( Fig.  5b and Supplementary Fig. 14d ).  SECs  were  not  the  only  perifollicular

source of IL-10, as macrophages produced even more IL-10 ( Fig. 5c and Supplementary Fig. 14e . N   cells exposed to IL-10 became ) C

inducible N BH   -like cells (iN BH  cells) that downregulated expression of CD15 and CD16, upregulated expression of mRNA for BAFF and APRIL and activated expression of AID-encoding mRNA in B cells ( Fig. 5d e , and Supplementary Fig. 15 ). Also, other splenic STAT3activating stromal factors such as GM-CSF and microbial products such as LPS and zymosan induced some iN BH  cells ( Supplementary Fig. 15 ). This induction did not strictly correlate with apoptosis but instead correlated with expression of B cell  -  stimulating factors.

N  C cells  migrating  across  LPS-activated SECs acquired iN BH   cell properties via a process that was blocked by preexposure of N   cells to C inhibitors of the kinase Jak2 and STAT3 ( Fig. 5f g , and Supplementary Fig. 16 , two signal transducers activated by many cytokine receptors, ) including the IL-10 receptor. SEC-induced iN BH  cells elicited not only AID-encoding mRNA but also IgG production in MZ B cells ( Fig. 5h i , . ) Finally, LPS-activated SECs produced not only IL-10 but also neutrophilattracting chemokines such as IL-8 (CXCL8), CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL3 and CXCL6 ( Supplementary Fig. 17a b , , which suggested that SECs ) delivered both reprogramming and chemotactic signals to N   cells.

and steady-state serum immunoglobulin titers produced in response to TI antigens in patients with severe congenital neutropenia (SCN) caused by deleterious elastase substitutions 40,41 .  Additional disease models included SCN with unknown molecular defects; SCN with substitutions in the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein that regulates cell motility; neutropenia in Shwachman-Bodian-Diamond syndrome caused by mutations in SBDSP1 which encodes an unknown pro-, tein;  neutropenia  in  warts-hypogammaglobulinemia-infectionsmyelokatexis syndrome caused by substitutions in the chemokine receptor CXCR4; cyclic neutropenia caused by deleterious elastase substitutions; chronic granulomatous disease caused by deleterious substitutions in the respiratory burst protein p91-PHOX; and leukocyte adhesion deficiency 1 caused by deleterious substitutions in the adhesion protein CD18 (refs.   40,41).

Relative to B cells of age-matched healthy people, patients with neutrophil disorders had normal circulating total B cells expressing CD19 and naive B cells with high expression of IgD but not of CD27 ( Fig.  6a .  In  contrast,  circulating  MZ  B  cells  with  expression  of ) CD27 and low expression of IgD were less abundant in most of these patients. Notably, IgM, IgG and IgA antibodies to microbial TI antigens such as LPS, lipoteichoic acid, peptidoglycan and galactoseα 1, -3-galactose were less abundant, even in patients with normal MZ B cells, whereas the abundance of IgM, IgG and IgA antibodies to TD antigens such as tetanus or diphteria toxins and protein-conjugated capsular polysaccharides was normal ( Fig. 6b and Supplementary Fig. 18a b , ).  IgM,  IgG  and  IgA  antibodies to capsular polysaccharides from Pneumococcus types 9N, 14, 19F and 23F, but not types 1, 3, 4, 6B, 7F, 8, 9V , 12F, 18C or 19A, were also lower in abundance ( Supplementary Fig. 18b and data not shown). We confirmed the reactivity of splenic MZ B cells to some of these TI antigens in vitro ( Supplementary Fig. 19 . )

We also noted a lower abundance IgA and, to some extent, IgM and IgG antibodies to Lactobacillus plantarum , Haemophilus influenzae type b, Salmonella typhimurium and Staphylococcus aureus but not to Escherichia coli ( Supplementary Fig. 20 ). Finally, patients with SCN had circulating MZ B cells with fewer V    3-23 gene mutaH tions,  and  their  MZ  was  poorly  developed  and  contained  fewer N  BH cells with shorter projections ( Fig. 6c d , . We found that iN ) BH cells obtained from some SCN patients had conserved B cell  -  helper activity in  vitro ( Supplementary Fig. 21 ,  which  suggested  that ) quantitative defects in N BH  cells may have been more important than functional defects in N BH  cells in the impairment of MZ B cell responses observed in neutropenic patients. Thus, N BH  cells may regulate MZ B cells and preimmune immunoglobulin responses to TI antigens in vivo .

## Splenic neutrophils involve mucosal microbes

Systemic  translocation  of  microbial  products  from  mucosal  surfaces influences the function of neutrophils 25 Given the participa-. tion of microbial signals such as LPS in the reprogramming of N C cells by SECs and the finding that N BH  cells enhanced innate immunoglobulin responses to microbial products that included LPS, we assessed the role of microbes in splenic colonization by N BH   cells. Immunohistochemistry showed that splenic colonization by N BH  cells began during fetal life but increased considerably as early as 2 d after birth ( Fig. 7a ), a time that coincided with mucosal colonization by bacteria. Fluorescence microscopy demonstrated that N BH  cell  -  occupied perifollicular areas contained LPS in adult spleens and mesenteric lymph nodes but not in fetal spleens or peripheral lymph nodes ( Fig. 7b c , . ) Fluorescence in situ hybridization showed bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) in splenic clusters of N BH   cells  and  MZ  B  cells identified by means of the nuclear antigen Pax5 ( Fig. 7d .  We also )

amplified 16S rRNA by PCR from splenic N BH   cells  but  not  from circulating N BH  cells, macrophages, DCs, SECs or B cells ( Fig. 7e . ) DNA sequencing confirmed the bacterial origin of the PCR-amplified products (data not shown). Germ-free mice as well as mice lacking TLR signaling  because  of  deletion  of  genes  encoding  the  adaptor MyD88 and the TLR-associated adaptor TRIF had fewer N BH  cells that expressed Ly6G and CD11b ( Fig. 7f . Thus, we propose that TLR ) signals from mucosal commensals enhanced the splenic recruitment and reprogramming of N BH  cells to enhance innate MZ B cell responses to highly conserved microbial TI antigens ( Supplementary Fig. 22 . )

## DISCUSSION

We have shown here that neutrophils colonized splenic peri-MZ areas via a noninflammatory pathway that became more prominent after postnatal mucosal colonization by bacteria. Splenic neutrophils had a distinct phenotype, formed MZ B cell  -  interacting NET-like structures and elicited class switching, somatic hypermutation and production of immunoglobulins by activating MZ B cells via a mechanism that involved BAFF, APRIL and IL-21. Patients with congenital neutropenia had fewer and hypomutated MZ B cells and their serum contained fewer preimmune immunoglobulins to TI antigens, which indicated that neutrophils interacted with MZ B cells to generate an innate layer of antimicrobial immunoglobulin defense.

Growing evidence has shown that many granulocyte subsets, such eosinophils and basophils, enhance immunoglobulin production by B cells 42,43 .  W e found that neutrophils occupied splenic peri-MZ areas through a noninflammatory process that accelerated after birth and involved mucosal colonization by bacteria. In contrast to circulating N   cells, splenic N C BH  cells included N BH1  and N BH2  subsets that expressed B cell  -  stimulating factors such as BAFF, APRIL and IL-21 as well as B cell  -  attracting chemokines such as CXCL12 and CXCL13. N  BH cells activated MZ B cells as efficiently as splenic T cells did via contact-dependent and contact-independent mechanisms. This MZ B cell  -  helper activity was associated mainly with N BH2  cells, which indeed secreted more BAFF, APRIL and IL-21, a cytokine with a key role in immunoglobulin production  5   . 3

N  BH1 cells and, to a lesser extent, N BH2  cells also had higher expression of TLRs, HLA-II, CD86, IL-1    , IL-6, IL-8, IL-12 and TNF than β did N   cells, which suggested C in situ activation by splenic signals. This activation was counterbalanced by higher expression of regulatory molecules such as CD11b, CD24, SOCS1, IL-10, progranulin, SLPI, arginase, IDO and iNOS  1, 32,33,37  -  39 and correlated with the capacity of N BH  cells to induce contact-independent suppression of T cells, as myeloid-derived suppressor cells do      . By exerting a dual B cell  1,7 helper and T cell  -  suppressor function, N BH  cells may maximize extrafollicular B cell responses to TI antigens while minimizing follicular B cell responses to TD antigens and inflammation. In the presence of inflammation caused by sepsis, infection with human immunodeficiency virus, hyper-IgD syndrome or systemic lupus erythematosus, N  BH cells became disorganized and infiltrated lymphoid follicles, possibly to present antigen to T cells    . Infections and autoimmune disor2 ders may also explain follicular infiltration by neutrophils in spleens from immunodeficient patients with deleterious TACI substitutions. Of note, inflammation was associated with loss of MZ tissue and N BH2 cells, the N BH  subset with predominant MZ B cell  -  helper activity.

By expressing inhibitors of proteases, reactive oxygen species and TNF such as progranulin and SLPI  , 1 37,39 N , BH  cells may be able to clear antigen and deliver B cell  -  helper signals without causing inflammatory tissue damage. In this context, N BH  cells occupied lymphoid sites characterized by continuous antigenic filtration, which included the presence of bacterial 16S RNA. Although largely blocked by mesenteric

lymph nodes  4   , some mucosal antigens undergo systemic translocation 4 to influence the function of cells of the immune response, including neutrophils  3  -  25 2 . Accordingly, spleens and mesenteric lymph nodes contained perifollicular LPS in addition to N BH  cells, but LPS was detectable  only  after  postnatal  mucosal  colonization  by  bacteria. By demonstrating fewer N BH  cells in mice deficient in MyD88 and TRIF and in germ-free mice, our data suggest that splenic filtration of microbial products triggers TLR-dependent recruitment, reprogramming and activation of N   cells. Microbe-independent signals C may also have a role, because some N BH  cells remained detectable in spleens not exposed to microbial signals.

n addition to enhancing SEC production of neutrophil-  targeting I chemokines  such  as  IL-8,  CXCL1,  CXCL2,  CXCL3  and  CXCL6, microbial TLR signals facilitate the reprogramming of N   cells into C N  BH cells by inducing the SEC release of STAT3-inducing mediators such as IL-10, a cytokine involved in the generation of noninflammatory neutrophils  5   . IL-10 would promote reprogramming of N 4 C cells as they interact with SECs to reach perifollicular and outer MZ areas. Additional IL-10 originated from perifollicular macrophages positioned nearby SECs and N BH  cells. As suggested by published studies 46 ,  TLR signals would target not only SECs but also MZ B cells, perhaps to enhance their responses to activation and chemotactic signals from N BH  cells. Consistent with that possibility, TLR ligation upregulates the BAFF and APRIL receptor TACI and the CXCL13 receptor CXCR5 on MZ B cells  8, 1 47 .

Although they had lower expression of transcripts encoding BAFF and  APRIL,  N BH2   cells  released  more  BAFF  protein  and  APRIL protein than N BH1  cells did; this may relate to the fact that BAFF and  APRIL  require  cleavage  from  inactive  precursors  to  activate B  cells.  Thus,  an  N BH1     ' preparatory  '  stage  with  more  gene  transcription  may  be  followed  by  an  N BH2   stage  with  more  protein processing  and  release.  Consistent  with  that  interpretation,  N BH2 cells  stimulated  MZ  B  cells  more  efficiently  than  N BH1   cells  did despite   having a worse survival profile. N BH2  cells may further amplify their MZ B cell  -  helper activity by forming postapoptotic NET-like projections      . These DNA-containing structures were more frequent 3,7 in apoptotic peri-MZ N BH2  cells and might enhance TI immunoglobulin responses not only by trapping antigen but also by delivering immunostimulatory DNA to MZ B cells  48   . However, the expression of BAFF and APRIL seemed more important than apoptosis in determining the B cell  -  helper activity of N BH  cells. Accordingly, MZ B cells expressed more TACI than naive B cells did and thus responded more rapidly and effectively to N BH  cells.

Being strategically located at the interface with the circulation, MZ B cells are geared to rapidly respond to blood-borne antigens 20,21 In . addition to triggering rapid IgM secretion, N BH  cells elicited AID expression as well as CSR to IgG and IgA in MZ B cells, whereas N C cells did not. Those findings correlated with the presence of ongoing CSR in some MZ B cells proximal to N BH  cells. Of note, N BH  cells induced CSR to IgG2, which typically occurs in B cell responses to TI antigens 20,21 .  Unlike N   cells, N C BH  cells also triggered SHM, which could provide a mechanistic explanation for published studies showing that MZ B cells undergo SHM through an extrafollicular pathway that may not require T cells 22,27,28 Finally, N . BH  cells promoted plasmacell differentiation and immunoglobulin production by a mechanism that involved BAFF, APRIL and IL-21. Consistent with those data, patients with deficiency in TACI or STAT3 had fewer MZ B cells. Of note, N BH  cells exerted some of their MZ B cell  -  helper activity via a contact-dependent mechanism that may have involved CD40L, a T cell molecule usually required for TD immunoglobulin responses in the germinal center of lymphoid folllicles 19 Accordingly, patients .

with CD40L defects have fewer MZ B cells in addition to defective TD immunoglobulin responses  21   , which supports the idea of a role for CD40L in N BH  cells.

The in vivo contribution of N BH  cells to innate MZ B cell responses was indicated by the observation that patients with neutropenia or functional neutrophil defects had not only fewer and hypomutated MZ B cells but also lower serum titers of IgM and IgG antibodies to TI antigens under steady-state conditions. This humoral deficiency probably did not originate from a greater microbial burden, which would instead cause polyclonal B cell activation and hypergammaglobulinemia. Accordingly, serum IgM and IgG antibodies to TD antigens were not affected by neutrophil insufficiency, which further points to specific involvement of N BH  cells in preimmune TI immunoglobulin responses. In agreement with the IgA-inducing activity of N  BH cells, neutrophil disorders were associated with lower serum titers of IgA antibodies to TI antigens and some mucosal bacteria. Although it is better known for its key role in mucosal immunity  9   , IgA also 1 enhances systemic immunity by interacting with neutrophils    . Thus, 9 N  BH cells may engage in crosstalk with MZ B cells to generate an innate line of IgA defense as well as IgM and IgG defense against systemic invasion by microbes breaching the mucosal barrier  4,   6   . 2 2 This indicates that an insufficiency of N BH  cells could contribute to the pathogenesis of systemic infections in patients with neutrophil disorders. Conversely, harnessing N BH  cells with specific adjuvants may enhance vaccine-induced immunoglobulin responses to poorly immunogenic TI antigens in healthy people.
