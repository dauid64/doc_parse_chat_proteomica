The mechanisms by which tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs) affect tumor growth are to a large extent unknown. Regulatory T-cells (T-regs) are functionally immune-suppressive subsets of T-cells. Depletion or inhibition of T-regs can enhance antitumor immunity. We demonstrated both by RT-PCR and by ELISA that murine TANs secrete significant amounts of the T-regs chemoattractant, CCL17, much more than circulating or splenic neutrophils, and at a level progressively increasing during tumor development. Migration assays, both in vitro and in vivo , showed recruitment of T-regs by TANs, which was inhibited with anti-CCL17 monoclonal antibodies. Systemic neutrophil depletion in tumor-bearing mice using anti-Ly6G monoclonal antibodies reduced the migration of T-regs into the tumors. We further showed, using flow cytometry, that CCL17 secretion by TANs is not limited to mouse models of cancer but is also relevant to human TANs. Our results suggest a new indirect mechanism by which TANs may inhibit antitumor immune activity, thus promoting tumor growth. We further describe, for the first time, a clear link between TANs and T-regs acting together to impair antitumor immunity.

Neutrophils make up a significant portion of the inflammatory cell infiltrate in many models of cancer. It is becoming increasingly clear that tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs) play a major role in cancer biology. 1,2 Despite some recent advancement in appreciating the role of neutrophils in cancer, the exact mechanisms by which TANs affect tumor growth are to a large extent unknown. In untreated tumors, neutrophils have been reported to suppress the antitumor immune response. 3 Depletion of these TANs inhibits tumor growth 4-6 and reduces the level of immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment. 4

As mentioned above, we have recently demonstrated that in untreated tumors, neutrophils assume a protumorigenic state, which by analogy to tumor-associated macrophages is termed

the 'N2' phenotype. We, however, also noted that under certain conditions ( e.g ., after Transforming Growth Factor beta (TGFb ) blockade), TANs can take on an 'N1' phenotype, which is proinflammatory and anti-immunogenic. 4 Gregory and Houghton raised the interesting question of whether the differences between N1 and N2 TANs were due to two unique transcriptional programs or instead represent two states of activation. 7 Although our work suggests a unique transcriptional program, we were, thus far, unable to identify clear markers for N1 or N2 TANs, somewhat limiting the separation between these neutrophil subsets, and their functions.

The role of chemokines in the pathogenesis of lung cancer, as well as other cancers, is being increasingly appreciated. 8 One example is the involvement of CCL5 (Rantes) in tumor invasiveness. 9 Another example that we have investigated is the role of CCL2 (MCP-1), which was found to have protumorigenic function in lung cancer by reducing the recruitment and/ or polarization of M2 macrophages. 10 We have previously found that TANs overexpress many chemokines where 13 of the 25 chemokines tested at the transcriptomic level were markedly upregulated in TANs compared to naıve neutrophils € (NNs). 11 Changes were further noted in the chemokines profile between N1 and N2 TANs, suggesting differences in their capabilities to recruit immunocytes (unpublished data).

In our transcriptomic data, the chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 17 (CCL17), also known as thymus and activationregulated chemokine (TARC), was not expressed in naıve or € splenic neutrophils, highly expressed in N2 TANs, but present at only very low levels in N1 TANs. 11 This is a

## What's new?

Getting rid of tumor associated neutrophils (TANs) can slow tumor growth, but how? This study explored whether TANs help protect tumors by pulling in regulatory T cells. These cells prevent the immune system from attacking the body's own cells; they suppress an immune response, and sometimes infiltrate tumors. In mice, the authors discovered, TANs secrete a chemokine that summons the T-reg cells. The farther along in tumor development, the stronger the attraction. These results show for the first time a link between TANs and T-regs acting together to impair anti-tumor immunity, promoting tumor growth.

particularly interesting chemokine as it has been shown to induce the recruitment of regulatory T-cells (T-regs) in general 12 and specifically in cancer. 13,14

T-regs play an important role in immunological selftolerance and are an immune-suppressive subsets of T-cells. 15 T-regs are known to infiltrate tumors in many tumor types, and tumor-infiltrating T-regs are often associated with a poor clinical outcome. 16 They promote progression of cancer through their ability to promote angiogenesis 16 and via the inhibition of both adaptive and innate antitumor immune responses. 17 It has been repeatedly shown that T-regs are able to migrate in response to CCL22 and CCL17, 18-20 and that depletion or inhibition of T-regs enhances antitumor immunity. 18,21,22 However, the mechanism through which the accumulation of T-regs in tumor microenvironment is regulated remains to be elucidated.

In our work, we explored the role of TANs in the recruitment of T-regs into the tumor microenvironment through the secretion of CCL17. Based on the aforementioned observations, we hypothesized that the secretion of CCL17 by TANs has an important role in the recruitment of T-regs, thus inhibiting the T-cytotoxic cell activity in the tumor and enabling tumor immune evasion.

## Material and Methods Animals

C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice were purchased from Harlan Laboratories (Jerusalem, Israel). Mice were housed under specific pathogen-free conditions at the Hebrew University School of Medicine Animal Resource Center. The protocols were approved by the animal care and use Committee (IACUC) of the Hebrew University School of Medicine. In all experiments, animals were euthanized before surgery.

## Cell lines

AB12, a murine malignant mesothelioma cell line, derived from an asbestos-induced tumor in a BALB/c mouse has been previously described in detail. 23 Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cell line (syngeneic to C57BL/6 mice) was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Tumor cells were cultured and maintained in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% heatinactivated fetal bovine serum, 2 mM glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 l g/ml streptomycin and 12.5 U/ml nystatin (all from Biological Industries, Beit Ha-emek, Israel). The cultures were maintained at 37 C /C14 in an atmosphere containing 5%

CO2. All cell lines were regularly tested and maintained negative for mycoplasma contamination.

## Animal models

BALB/c mice were injected on the right flank with 1 3 10 6 AB12. Tumor growth was measured every 2-3 days. At indicated times, flank tumors were harvested from mice, minced and digested with 1.5 mg/ml DNase I (Roche applied science) and 3 mg/ml collagenase type IV (Sigma-Aldrich) at 37 C for 1 hr. /C14

In some experiments, tumor-bearing mice were fed with chow containing the TGFb inhibitor, SM16 or control chow as described previously, 4 after which flank tumors were harvested and minced in DNase I and collagenase.

C57BL/6 mice were injected i.v. with 1 3 10 6 LLC. Mice were euthanized 21 days later, lung tissues were harvested and placed in formaldehyde. Paraffin-embedded and formalin-fixed samples were cut into sections, which were then processed for immunohistochemistry (IHC). Systemic neutrophil depletion was achieved by i.p. injection of the anti-Ly6G antibody 1A8 (BioXCell, West Lebanon, NH) as described below.

## Human samples

Collection of human lung tumor samples was approved by University of Pennsylvania Institutional Review Board (IRB). Written informed consent was received from the patients as required. Resected tumors were sent to pathological evaluation, and remnants of the tumor and adjacent 'normal' lung tissue were digested with a collagenase cocktail and were evaluated for the amount of CCL17 in neutrophils using flow cytometry. Human neutrophils were defined as being positive both for CD66b and CD15.

## Neutrophils isolation

For isolation of TANs, tumors were harvested and digested as mentioned above. Ly6G 1 cells were isolated using EasySep PE selection kit (STEMCELL Technologies, Vancouver, Canada) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Purification of neutrophils was confirmed with Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis with phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated antiLy6G abs, showing a purity of about 85-90%.

For isolation of splenic neutrophils, spleens from AB12tumor-bearing BALB/c mice were harvested and digested with PBS. RBCs were lysed using lysis buffer containing 0.15 M NH4Cl, 10 mM KHCO3 and 0.1 mM Na2-EDTA, and Ly6G 1 cells were purified using the Easy-Sep PE selection kit

according to the manufacturer's protocol. Purification of neutrophils was confirmed, showing a purity of about 90-95%.

For isolation of bone marrow neutrophils (BMN), BM was harvested from femurs and tibias of naıve BALB/c mice € under sterile conditions and suspended in Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS). Red blood cells (RBCs) were lysed using lysis buffer and Ly6G 1 cells were purified using the Easy-Sep PE selection kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. Purification of neutrophils was confirmed, showing a purity of about 95%.

## CD4 1 T-cell isolation

Spleens from naıve BALB/c mice were harvested and digested € with PBS. RBCs were lysed using lysis buffer. CD4 1 T-cells were isolated using EasySep mouse CD4 1 T-cell enrichment kit (STEMCELL Technologies) according to the manufacturer's protocol.

## RNA isolation and real-time RT-PCR

RNA was prepared from N1, N2 TANs (isolated from AB12 tumors in BALB/c mice) and BMNs (isolated from naıve € BALB/c mice) using the PerfectPure TM RNA Cell &amp; Tissue kit (5 PRIME, Hamburg, Germany). Absorbance at 260/280 nm for mRNA purity at a ratio above 1.9 was achieved for all samples used. cDNA was made using High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA). CCL17 gene expression was assessed using relative quantification ( DD Ct) RT-PCR and is shown as relative expression in TANs versus BMNs. RNA level was normalized to GAPDH levels. Each sample was run in triplicate and the experiment was repeated three times.

## CCL17 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)

A total of 4 3 10 6 TANs purified from tumors, splenic neutrophils isolated from AB12-tumor-bearing BALB/c mice or BMNs of naıve BALB/c mice were cultured in 12-well plate € for 24 hr. The amount of CCL17 in the supernatant was determined by ELISA kit (R&amp;D system), according to the manufacturer's instruction.

## Transwell migration assay/ in vitro migration assay

The 24-well Transwell plates with 6.5-mm insert filter (5m m pore size polycarbonate membrane; Costar) were used to measure migration. CD4 1 T-cells were isolated from naıve spleens € using magnetic beads. TANs and splenic neutrophils were isolated from AB12-tumor-bearing BALB/c mice, and BMNs were isolated from naıve € BM of BALB/c mice. The bottom chamber was filled with 1.5 3 10 6 neutrophils with or without neutralizing anti-CCL17 mAb (3 m g/ml, R&amp;D systems). Then an insert was placed over the plate and 5 3 10 4 CD4 1 T-cells were placed in the upper chamber. After incubation at 37 C /C14 for overnight, T-regs that had migrated into the bottom chamber were quantified by counting and using flow cytometry. Cells were stained with APC-conjugated anti-CD4 and FITCconjugated anti-CD25 (all from BioLegend, San Diego, CA).

Migration was calculated as percentage of CD4 1 /CD25 1 cells (24 hr, t 1 ) divided by their percentage at t 0 .

## Air pouch model and in vivo migration

BALB/c mice were anesthetized with isoflurane, and dorsal air pouches were raised by injecting 5 ml of sterile air s.c. on days 0 and 3. 24 On day 5, 10 6 neutrophils from the different subsets, in 100 m l sterile PBS, were injected into the air pouches. The neutrophils were also injected combined with neutralizing anti-CCL17 mAb (3 m g/ml). Mice were killed 3 or 24 hr later, and pouch lavage was carried out with 3 ml of PBS. The total number of cells was counted and the number of CD4 1 /CD25 1 or CD4 1 /FoxP3 1 cells was determined using flow cytometry. The number of T-regs entering the pouch when no cells are inserted to the pouch was reduced as baseline.

## Neutrophil depletion

Systemic neutrophil depletion was achieved by i.p. injection of 300 m g of purified monoclonal anti-Ly6G antibody 1A8 (BioXCell) in 100 l l PBS to C57Bl/6 mice after LLC i.v. inoculation.

Injections were started 1 day following the injection of tumor cells, and antibodies were injected every 2-3 days, for 3 weeks, until the mice were sacrificed; 1 day after the last injection, depletion of neutrophils from the blood was confirmed as recently detailed. 25 Briefly, depletion was first confirmed by flow cytometry using the anti-Ly6G antibody. Then, to confirm that the lack of Ly6G cells was not due to the fact that the Ly6G epitope was blocked by the in vivo administered antibody (therefore not accessible to the FACS antibody), we used a secondary antibody directed to the Ly6G antibody that was given in vivo for depletion. Adding the secondary antibody did not change the results as evaluated by flow cytometry, confirming the depletion of neutrophils.

## IHC staining of T-regs using anti-FoxP3 1 mAb

Sections were deparaffinized with xylene and rehydrated through gradient ethanol immersions (100 and 96%, respectively). Endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched by 3% H2O2 (DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark). Ag retrieval of FoxP3 1 was performed by microwaving the section for 20 min in citric acid buffer (pH 6; Dako Cytomation, DAKO). The slides were washed twice in distilled water and treated again with 3% H2O2. The sections were washed with PBS for 5 min and then incubated with a 1/100 dilution of anti-FoxP3 (clone FJK-16s, eBioscience). Sections were treated with anti-rat HRP (ImmPRESS Reagent; VECTOR Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) for 30 min following three washes with PBS; reaction product was visualized using the DAB substrate kit (VECTOR Laboratories). Sections were counterstained with hematoxylin for 20 sec. and rinsed with tap water, immediately dehydrated by sequential immersion in gradient ethanol and xylene and then mounted with mounting solution (VECTOR Laboratories) on coverslips. Stained cells were counted under a light microscope

## Results

## CCL17 is expressed and secreted in N2 TANs

We have previously shown that one of the highly upregulated genes in N2 TANs compared to N1 TANs, BM-residing neutrophils or the granulocytic fraction of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (G-MDSCs) is CCL17. We have also confirmed that CCL17 was not only transcribed but was also produced

and secreted by N2 TANs. 11 To further investigate these findings, we isolated neutrophils from untreated AB12 mesothelioma murine tumors (N2 TANs) and from murine tumors treated with the TGFb inhibitor, SM16 (N1 TANs). The expression of the ccl17 gene mRNA as quantified by qPCR was significantly higher in N2-TANs compared to N1-TANs (Fig. 1 a ). Furthermore, we found that during tumor progression the expression of CCL17 mRNA in TANs increases compared to negligible expression in naıve € BMNs (Fig. 1 b ). We next quantified CCL17 secretion by the different populations of neutrophils. We show that the amount of CCL17 measured in neutrophils purified from the BMNs and spleen neutrophils (SNs) was not significantly different from the background control ( i.e ., medium alone). In contrast, we found that purified TANs secreted CCL17 at significantly higher levels with an increase of up to sevenfold (Fig. 1 ), c supporting the notion that TANs are capable of secreting this

chemokine. We further show that the amount of CCL17 secreted by N2 TANs was about twofold higher than the secretion by N1 TANs (Fig. 1 ). As TGFc b has been shown in vivo to be responsible for the polarization to N2 TANs, 4 we hypothesized that exposure of neutrophils to TGFb in vitro could increase the secretion of CCL17. Interestingly, however, pretreatment of BMNs by TGFb did not increase the secretion of CCL17 from these cells. No secretion of CCL17 was found from the tumor cell lines AB12 and LLC.

## TAN preferably attract T-regs in vitro in a CCL17dependent manner

We next evaluated whether the secretion of CCL17 from TANs has a functional impact on recruiting T-regs in vitro . To this end, we co-cultured CD4 1 T-cells isolated from spleens with either BMNs, neutrophils isolated from spleens of tumor-bearing mice ( i.e ., G-MDSCs), TANs or the neutrophildepleted cell fraction isolated from the tumor (NFT). Our data show that the percentage of T-regs (CD4 1 /CD25 1 cells) recruited by neutrophils was significantly higher when T-regs where co-cultured with TAN compared to BMN, SN or NFT (Fig. 2 ). a To conclusively determine the role CCL17 plays in T-regs recruitment by TANs, we tested the consequences of adding a CCL17-neutralizing mAb to the co-culture. We show that although some T-regs recruitment is still apparent, the CCL17-neutralizing mAb induced a significant reduction in the selective recruitment of T-regs by TANs in vitro (Fig. 2 ). b The plated AB12 cell line itself did not attract more T-regs than medium alone (data not shown).

## TAN preferably attract T-regs in vivo in a CCL17-dependent manner

We next sought to evaluate the capability of TANs to recruit T-regs in a more physiologically relevant setting in vivo . For that purpose, we used an in vivo migration assay by injecting neutrophils to a preprepared subcutaneous air pouch, providing a confined microenvironment for the study of cellular responses. Equal numbers of TANs, BMN or splenic neutrophils (which are mostly G-MDSCs) were injected into the air pouches, and the number of T-regs migrating into the pouch after 3 and 24 hr was determined through cell counting and flow cytometry. Specifically, we determined the number of T-regs by both CD4 1 /CD25 1 and by CD4 1 /FoxP3 1 (Fig. 3). The migration of T-regs, normalized to their migration into empty pouches, was significantly elevated when injecting TANs compared to BMN and G-MDSCs (Figs. 3 -3 ). Morea c over, we found that N2 TANs were capable of attracting significantly more T-regs than N1 TANs (Fig. 3 d ). To investigate the molecular mechanism by which TANs recruit T-regs, we injected TANs together with CCL17-neutralizing mAb into the air pouch. As a result, the number of T-regs migrating into the pouch was significantly reduced, suggesting that the chemoattraction of T-regs by TANs is mediated, at least in part, by CCL17 (Figs. 3 e and 3 ). f Taken together, these observations suggest that T-regs recruitment can be

mediated by TANs in vivo and that this process is mediated, at least in part, by TAN-derived CCL17.

## TAN depletion reduces the recruitment of T-regs into tumors

To evaluate the immunological and clinical importance of the recruitment of T-regs by TANs, we decided to test the consequences of neutrophil depletion on the recruitment of T-regs to the tumor microenvironment. To this end, we used the non-

small cell lung cancer LLC model orthotopically inoculated in the lungs via i.v. injection. Neutrophil depletion, using the neutrophil-specific anti-Ly6G mAb, was initiated the day following the injection of tumor cells and continued for 3 weeks. After 21 days, the animals were euthanized and the lungs were analyzed for tumor burden and the presence of tumorassociated T-regs ( i.e ., FoxP3 1 cells). The area of tumor in the lung was 11.3% 6 2.7% of the lung in the control mice, and only 4.3% 6 1.8% of the lung in mice depleted of neutrophils ( p 5 0.03). As shown in Figure 4 a , and in the example in Figure 4 b , the number of T-regs in the lungs was decreased significantly when neutrophils were systemically depleted. These results further support the notion that TANs play an important actual role in the migration of T-regs into the tumor.

## CCL17 is expressed in human neutrophils from lung tumors, and not in neutrophils isolated from adjacent lung tissue

To assess the relevance of our findings in mice to human tumors, we used flow cytometry to evaluate the amount of CCL17 in human lung cancer TANs. We performed this analysis in two lung adenocarcinoma tumors and compared it to neutrophils from adjacent 'normal' lung tissue. Although there was

no CCL17 in neutrophils from adjacent lung tissue (Fig. 5 a ), we were able to identify a small but clear population of TANs that are positive for CCL17 in both tumor samples (Fig. 5 b ).

## Discussion

Neutrophils are the most abundant circulating leukocyte in humans, and they play a well-established role in host defense against invading pathogens. 26 Recently, it has become clear that TANs play an important role in cancer biology, although the literature has described a dual role for neutrophils in tumor biology. 1,2 In the last two decades, the limited view of neutrophils as short-acting phagocytic cells was challenged by the demonstration that they survive much longer than first suggested, and can express key inflammatory mediators, including chemokines and cytokines. 26

T-regs, an immune-suppressive subset of T-cells, 15 were shown to infiltrate a variety of different tumors, and their presence in the tumor microenvironment is often associated with a poor clinical outcome. 16 T-regs were repeatedly shown to be capable of promoting cancer progression 16 and inhibiting both adaptive and innate antitumor immune responses. 17 T-regs are crucial in the establishment and maintenance of peripheral immune tolerance; however, they represent one of

the main obstacles to effective antitumor responses, promoting tumor-specific tolerance and cancer escape. 27 It is therefore reasonable to assume that the depletion or inhibition of T-regs can enhance antitumor immunity. 28 High levels of T-regs were suggested to be associated with advanced tumor stages, but also with poor therapeutic efficacy, including by immunotherapy. 29

It has been previously shown that T-regs preferentially migrate to and accumulate in tumors 30,31 although the mechanisms for this are yet to be determined. One mediator shown to be involved in some tumors is the chemokine CCL22, secreted from tumor cells and tumor macrophages in patients with ovarian and breast tumors 31,32 as well as in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. 14 It has been proposed that other chemokines may be involved in T-regs recruitment to the tumor microenvironment and although a correlation between the level of CCL17 and the number of intratumoral T-regs has been demonstrated, 13 the direct involvement of CCL17 in this process has not been reported before.

We previously observed that the level of CCL17 mRNA was markedly upregulated in N2 TANs 11 and the migration of T-regs in response to CCL17 has been repeatedly demonstrated, 18-20 albeit not in the context of cancer. In our study, we have identified the connection between these observations, describing a previously unknown link between tumor neutrophils and T-regs. Our data suggest that TANs may be involved in a new mechanism for the recruitment of T-regs into the tumor bed, leading to inhibition of the immune system and immune surveillance.

We showed that CCL17 is produced and secreted at significant levels by TANs, especially N2 TANs (Fig. 1). In a series of experiments, we demonstrate the importance of TAN-secreted CCL17 for the chemoattraction of T-regs both in vitro (Fig. 2) and in vivo (Fig. 3). Interestingly, it appears that inhibition of CCL17 leads to a reduction in T-regs attraction; however, a level of T-regs chemoattraction remains (Figs. 2 and 3), suggesting the involvement of additional mechanisms that mediate the recruitment of T-regs by TANs. One possible chemokine that could have a role in the attraction of T-regs into the tumors is CCL22. 14 Unfortunately, CCL22 was not evaluated in our transcriptomic analysis. 11 However, we found by real-time RT-PCR that the mRNA level of CCL22 is markedly increased in TANs compared to NNs, though to a lesser extent than CCL17 (data not shown). Lastly, the importance of neutrophils for the recruitment of T-regs was shown in a tumor model, where depleting N2 TANs markedly and significantly reduced the level of T-regs in the tumors, significantly slowing tumor growth. Depletion of neutrophils was done using the current standard for this purpose-anti-Ly6G mAb. 33 This model has some limitations, because depletion is not usually fully achieved in the blood or inside the tumor. In addition, the use of anti-Ly6G mAb may lead to the depletion of GMDSCs. Our data show, however, that G-MDSCs ( i.e ., the splenic subset) do not secrete CCL17 or attract T-regs.

Figure 6. A schematic representation of the new immune surveillance mechanism described. The immune system (bottom right) is supposed to recognize and attack the tumor. The tumor secretes TGFb -inducing N2 TANs. These neutrophils support the tumor directly, but also secrete CCL17, a strong chemoattractant of regulatory T-cells (Tregs). These T-regs enter the tumor and inhibit the function of the immune system toward the tumor. [Color figure can be viewed in the online issue, which is available at wileyonlinelibrary.com.]

As previously mentioned, the role of chemokines in the pathogenesis of cancer is being increasingly appreciated, 8-10 and we have previously suggested their importance in the effects of TANs on tumor growth. 11 On the basis of these data, we believe that in addition to providing direct protumor support, TANs affect tumor growth by the secretion of chemokines, attracting other tumor-promoting cells of both the innate and adaptive immune system. 34 The important effect of TAN-secreted CCL17, described in our study, is probably just one of several mechanisms used by TANs to recruit protumor effector cells to the tumor microenvironment.

An interesting question arising from our data is what induces the neutrophils to secrete CCL17. We suspected that TGFb may be a candidate as part of its effects in polarizing neutrophils toward N2-TANs. Pretreatment of BMNs with TGFb , however, did not change CCL17 secretion by them. Several cytokines, such as TNFa , IFNg , IL-4 and IL-13, have been previously connected to the regulation of CCL17 in other cells ( e.g ., monocytes and fibroblasts). 35,36 Further investigation into the mechanism of the regulation of CCL17 secretion by neutrophils is warranted.

The novelty in our findings is in showing a new mechanism by which TANs indirectly affect tumor growth, and in demonstrating an unknown link between the innate immune ( i.e ., the neutrophils) and the adaptive immune systems, joining forces for the benefit of the tumor. The recruitment of N2 neutrophils through the secretion of TGFb by the tumor eventually results in the inhibition of the adaptive immune system by T-regs (see Fig. 6).

As happens in most immune responses, the effect of one cell upon another is bidirectional. The cross-talk between neutrophils and the adaptive immune system, including B-cells, T-cells and Natural killer (NK) cells, is being increasingly appreciated. 26 Interestingly, T-regs have been shown to affect neutrophils where Himmel et al . demonstrated that human T-regs produce CXCL8, which is a potent neutrophil

chemoattractant. 37 Furthermore, in infectious disease models, it was suggested that T-regs can directly induce an immunosuppressive phenotype in neutrophils. 38 Neutrophils have been shown to be involved in the recruitment of adaptive immune cells-activated neutrophils can attract TH1 and TH17 cells to inflamed tissues via the release of the appropriate chemokines. 39 However, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that secretion of CCL17 by neutrophils and recruitment of T-regs by TANs has been demonstrated.

The exact role of TANs in tumors has been a matter of conflict for many years, where studies showed both protumorigenic and antitumorigenic effects, as we have recently summarized. 1 In our study, TANs are shown to have a positive effect on tumor immune evasion, suggesting the possibil-

ity that manipulation of neutrophils could confer a positive effect in the battle against cancer. The data demonstrating antitumor effects of neutrophils, however, should not be underestimated. It appears, as we and others have demonstrated before, that indeed neutrophils can act as a doubleedge sward. Revealing the exact mechanisms by which TANs affect tumor growth may in turn lead to the development of better immunotherapies using the favorable functions of neutrophils for the benefit of the patient.

Our results show that TANs from established tumors produce CCL17, recruiting T-regs into the tumor in mice and possibly in humans as well. These findings suggest a new indirect mechanism by which TANs may inhibit the antitumor immune activity, promoting tumor growth.
