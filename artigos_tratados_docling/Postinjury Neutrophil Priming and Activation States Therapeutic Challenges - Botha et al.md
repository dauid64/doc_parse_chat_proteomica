ABSTRACT\_Both hyperactivity and hypoactivity of neutrophils (PMNs) have been implicated in the pathogenesis of postinjury multiple organ failure. In this paper, the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation of PMN O2 production are reviewed. In addition; relevant research laboratory techniques for measuring both intracellular and extracellular Oz release are outlined. In a pilot study PMN NADPH were defined: resting, primed, activated; and unresponsive. PMNs from normal adult are in the resting state. In contrast; PMNs from patients with severe torso trauma are primed and activated in the first 24 h postinjury, but, after 48 h, become unresponsive to both receptor-dependent (platelet activating factor and N-formyl-methyl-leucyl-phenylalanine) and receptor-independent (phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate) activation: The ability to identify at-risk patients and provide a rationale for ameliorating PMN-mediated tissue injury in patients with hyperinflammation syndromes are discussed. In addition; the importance of identifying patients with PMNs that are unresponsive; and the necessity for increasing PMN function in these patients in order to reduce the risk of sepsis, are also discussed.

## INTRODUCTION

Neutrophils (PMNs) may be either hyperactive or hypoacin  the  pathogenesis   of   postinjury   multiple organ failure (MOF) (1-5). For example, PMNs respond to the systemic inflammation that initially follows major trauma by becoming primed and activated. In this scenario, PMNs cause early prominent   pulmonary component   (i.e., early onset   adult   respiratory   distress syndrome) (1, 6-8) major trauma is often associated with quantitative and tative defects in PMNs that place patients at increased risk of sepsis (9-14). In this scenario; late onset MOF, precipitated by infectious complications such as pneumonia, initiates; or complicates, already existing organ failure (15, 16). PMN function may thus determine whether patients experience hyperinflam mation and are at risk for PMN-mediated   organ  injury Or become   immunosuppressed and are overwhelming sepsis, complicated by MOF syndromes: quali -

Subsequent proinflam matory insults, such as aspiration; hemorrhagic shock, Or secondary surgical procedures; promote further PMN sequestration and activate PMN for enhanced, extracellular release of 02 The resulting endothelial injury leads to a self-sustaining of PMN sequestration, endothelial injury, and eventual end organ damage and failure. Several laboratories have documented that PMNs from severely injured patients are primed for 02 release during the first 2 days after trauma (21, 22) However, in the later stages of recovery from major   torso trauma and burns, down-regulation of proliferation of PMN progenitors in the bone marrow and reduced capacity of circulating PMN to release 02 and kill bacteria have been observed (9, 14) Such patients are at risk for developing sepsis (5). apparent that the status of the PMN oxidase responsible for the PMN 02 response to injury is an important factor in deter mining the clinical outcome in patients suffering major trauma or burns\_ (e.g-, cycle

PMN-induced organ failure 'is an inappropriate, extracellular release  of superoxide anion (02) (17). Several   laboratories have proposed model to explain the role of PMNs in the development of MOF (4, 18-20) In this model, trauma induces systemic expression of proinflammatory  mediators

on the clinical horizon; information about the functional status of the PMN will become vital in order to select appropriate PMN immunomodulatory strategies for the management of severely injured patients. Additionally, it is critically important to deconsistent, reliable approach with which to assess the velop

functional status of PMNs and determine the ability of PMNs to   express extracellular   02 trauma patients; we believe it is necessary: 1) to understand the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in the generation of 02 by primed and activated PMNs; 2) to establish (based upon this   mechanistic knowledge) sound in vitro techniques   for measuring both intracellular and extracellular release of PMN 02= and 3) to accurately quantitate and compare the functional capacity of PMNs from trauma patients with data from healthy donors.

In this paper, current knowledge about the assembly, ing and activation of the NADPH oxidase enzyme complex responsible for PMN 02 generation will be reviewed. Addi tionally,  clinically  relevant   techniques   that can be used to assess the status of the oxidase and its primary product, 02 will be discussed. Based upon this basic science information; we will develop a schema for defining the various states of activity of the PMN NADPH oxidase enzyme complex.

## PMN SUPEROXIDE GENERATION

## Receptor-mediated signaling

The plasma membrane of the PMN expresses a rich array of receptors. PMN function can be upregulated by increases in the number andlor affinity of a given receptor (23, 24). Ligation (ie., binding of the cognate  receptor by ligand) of unique receptors by specific  agonists   activates intracellular   signal transduction pathways that modulate   distinct, measurable effector responses. The components via which G-protein linked receptors, such as the N-formyl-methyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP)-receptor, transduce a signal are: the phospholipases C, D, and A2, and second messengers such as diacylglycerol   (DAG), inositol   triphosphate,   phosphatidate, and arachidonate. This signaling causes calcium mobilization; protein kinase C (PKC) activation and   phosphorylation  of serine/threonine Or tyrosine   residues (25-31). Although   the direct causal links between   ligand,   phospholipases, second messengers, calcium; PKC, and effector function remain to be elucidated, much has already been learned. For example, bindof fMLP to the fMLP receptor initiates at least two signal sequences, one calcium-dependent   and leading to activation of PKC, and the other being calcium-independent. The results of ligation between fMLP and its surface mem brane receptor are 02 generation and chemotaxis. key ing being ing

## The PMN NADPH oxidase

PMN O2 is generated primarily by the highly specialized, membrane-associated NADPH   oxidase (32) In   the resting steady  state, the oxidase, which  consists of several cytoplasmic and plasma membrane-bound components; is only partially assembled and dormant.  Upon activation; the oxidase becomes fully assembled and catalyzes the reduction of oxygen to 02 (Fig: 1) The oxidase contains several critical components including cytochrome bss8 which consists of two subsystem

The oxidase is unassembled in the resting PMN, with components in both the cytosol and plasma membrane\_ Both subunits of cytochrome and gp-22) and the G-protein, rap1A, are found in the plasma membrane of the cell, as well as the membrane surrounding specific granules. At least three other protein components of the oxi dase complex, p47-phox, p67-phox, and rac are located in the cyto plasm and translocate to the plasma membrane and the phagolyso some membrane only when the cell is activated (e.g., through fMLP receptor   binding and signal   transduction) . competent enzyme complex is formed only when all components of the oxidase have been docked on membrane surface in the proper relationship to rap1A and cytochrome Assembly of the oxidase culminates in the oxidation of NADPH and reduction of O2 to O2 gp-91 spatial

In  the  resting state, 10-259 of cytochrome bss8 is contained in the plasma membrane, while the remainder resides in the membranes surroundcytoplasmic specific granules (33). activation; the membranes of specific granules fuse with the membranes of the phagosome to form phagolysosome. In addition to depositing specific granule contents into the phagolysosome, the specific   granule   membrane enriches   the membrane   of the phagolysosome with   cytochrome bss8 and ensures that   the majority of the 02 generated by the PMN is directed intracel lularly into the phagolysosome. However, with intense degran ulation; extensive migration of specific granules and fusion with, the plasma membrane occurs. This serves as a means of replenishing plasma membrane stores of cytochrome b5s8 and ity that extracellular release of 02 will OCCUI (34, 35). Other vital   components   of the  oxidase are the   cytosolic   proteins p47-phox, p67-phox; and rac, and the membrane-associated G-protein raplA (36-39) When   activated by agonists, the cytosolic components of the oxidase translocate to the plasma membrane and become functional component of the membrane surrounding the phagolysosome (33, 40) The fully assembled oxidase system catalyses the oxidation of NADPH and reduction of O2 to 02 during cellular response that is known as the respiratory burst (36, 41) Upon ing to,

## Priming and activation of the PMN NADPH oxidase

Agonists that directly stimulate  assembly of the NADPH oxidase and 02 generation are called activating agents. nists that do not activate 02 generation directly, but enhance Ago-

to agonists; are called priming agents.  When PMNs are exto priming agent and then exposed to an activating agent; 02 generation is enhanced several-fold. This phenom enon is called 'priming' (42, 43) A typical example of PMN priming is illustrated in Fig. 2, in which extracellular release of 02 by PMNs sampled from healthy volunteers is used as an index of priming. In this example, normal, unstimulated PMNs (Fig: 2A) exhibit a low basal rate of 02 release (V max = .08 + 02 nmol of 02 /min/1.3 X 10 oxidase with a standard agonist; such as 1 fMLP (Fig: 2B), increases 02 modestly, but significantly max 60 + 06 normal PMN are stimulated with 20 nM of the potent priming agent; platelet activating factor (PAF; Fig: no increase in 02 release is observed max =.09 + .02 nmol of 02 /min/1.3 106 PMNs). However, when PMNs are pretreated with the same dose of PAF for as little as 5 min and are subsequently cally (Vmax 1.65 + .21 nmol of 02 /min/1.3 X PMNs; p 05, compared to 1 uM fMLP) (44, 45). The physiologic purpose   of   priming may be to enhance   oxygen-dependent killing at sites of infection. At present; the molecular events leading to PMN priming are not clear. However; it is known that assembly of the NADPH oxidase is not associated with the primed state. Primed PMN however, have elevated levels posed do,

PMNs from normal human volunteers were incubated without agonist (A), or in the presence of fMLP alone (B), 20 nM PAF alone (C), or the combination of PAF, followed by fMLP (D). Data represent kinetics of the mean PMN Oz release for 20 individual subjects over 10 min. The y axis is optical density (OD). Vmax for the NADPH oxidase was computed from the initial slope of the curve and reflects the maximum initial rate of Oz release. The enhanced release of (see values for Vmax) in response to fMLP activation after exposure to PAF (D) compared to the PMN Oz response to fMLP alone (B), is defined as priming. Note that priming with PAF alone (C) does not induce activation of the NADPH oxidase, and, therefore; does not result in Oz expression exceeding basal levels (A): 02

## MEASUREMENT OF PMN O2 GENERATION

## Available methodologies

PMN 02 generation can be measured by several techniques, and it is important to select an appropriate assay. PMN 02 is generated by whole cell preparations as well as by membrane fractions in cell-free preparations. In whole cell preparations, both intracellular 02 production and extracellular 02 release can be OI kinetic assay . In spectrophotometric end-point assays; the total amount of 02 that is released into the extracellular environment by a fixed number of   PMNs, after quantitated. In kinetic assays performed by sophisticated spectrophotometers and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) readers, both the total amount and the velocity of 02 release is determined . Because the kinetics of PMN 02 release varies with different stimuli and is not linear with respect to time, a kinetic 02 assay is preferable to an end-point assay . The kinetics of PMN 02 release is best interpreted by deter mining the Michaelis-Menten parameters V max the equation: ing

where v is the velocity of the reaction being measured; max is the maximal velocity of the enzymatic reaction when all available enzyme is complexed in the presence of an infinite sub strate, S; [S] is the concentration of the substrate in the ular reaction; and Km, Michaelis constant, is a measure of the affinity with which substrate is bound to the enzyme In the equation above Vmax represents the maximum initial rate of 02 release and is sensitive indicator of the status of NADPH oxidase function (48-50). partic -

## Intracellular 02 generation

Intracellular  02 release can be   measured  directly by the reduction of nitroblue tetrazolium; a blue dye that is taken into the cytoplasm of PMNs and is reduced by by-products of the respiratory burst to a black precipitate that can be observed microscopically (51) The nitroblue tetrazolium test is semi quantitative at best and has found its main application in the diagnosis of chronic granulomatous  disease (52). Intracellu larly, PMN 02 is rapidly converted to H2O2 by superoxide dismutase (53). Intracellular H2O2 levels can be determined by employing 2',7'-dicholorofluorescein diacetate, fluoro chrome that is activated by H2O2 and can be detected by flow cytometry (54,55). By co-incubating PMNs with fluorescently flow stained bacteria and 2',7' -dicholorofluorescein diacetate, cytometric techniques can be used to simultaneously measure phagocytosis and intracellular HzO2 production (56, 57) Flow cytometry can be used to study relatively pure populations of PMNs isolated from peripheral blood, but, in order to avoid any factitious priming andJor activation associated with separation techniques, intracellular PMN HzO2 generation can also be assessed in whole blood (58). Although flow cytometry has

the   advantage of identifying subpopulations of PMNs   with different function (55), it can not assess the kinetics of H2O2 generation:

## Extracellular 02 release

We have chosen the kinetic, microplate, cytochrome c reduction assay to assess extracellular PMN 02 release in trauma patients; based on the simplicity of the assay, specificrelease, and sensitivity (nanomolar range). With the microplate assay, several factors are important in ensuring  accurate data with minimal   variability between experiments and different laboratories: 1) the volume in each well should be kept constant; e.g  150 uL, since it determines the   spectrophotometric length (49, 66); 2) dual wavelength measurements (e.g., 550 and 557 nm) increase accuracy (50); 3) a narrow bandwidth filter (e.g-, 1 nm) increases accu racy (49); 4) the concentration of PMNs in suspension should be 1 X reduction does with   increases in cell concentration; particularly at higher cell concentrations and in end-point assays (66); 5) PMNs should be kept in suspension during the assay, unless the investigator wishes to study the effects of adhesion on 02 release (50); 6) a sufficient amount of cytochrome c, e.g-, 75 uM; should be available to interact with released 02 to avoid substrate deficiency as the ratelimiting factor in the assay (49); 7) assay temperature should be maintained at 37*C, particularly when the initial rate of PMN 02 release is studied (49, 67). path 106

In evaluating the role of PMNs in organ injury, it is important to measure extracellular 02 release. PMN release of 02 can be easily determined by an end-point spectrophotometric measurement of superoxide dismutase-inhibitable cytochrome reduction after separating PMNs from whole blood (53, 59, 60). Microplate readers have an advantage over standard spectrophotometers in that several experiments can be read simultaneously (49, 50, 61) Two other methods are often used to measure extracellular   release   of reactive oxygen species A fluorescence   assay, employing the fluorochrome; scopoletin; and horseradish peroxidase, can be used to measure extracel indirect assay of 02 is specific for HzO2 and is probably more sensitive than the cytochrome c reduction assay; however, it is more difficult to perform. Based on the observation that actiassays were developed for basic and clinical studies (63-65). The molecular species responsible for the light emission is not known with certainty, although 02 and HzO2 are most likely involved. By chemiluminescence probes such as luminol and Iuever, complex assay and the reagents are light-sensitive. using

## Choosing agonists

Priming and activation of the PMN oxidase is caused by many agents including bacteria and bacterial products (fMLP, cytochalasin B),   particulates   (silica, zymosan, and   plastic mediators   (cytokines,  lipid mediators, immunoglobulins, and complement products), and nonphysiologic agents (phorbol esters) (45) When designing in vitro

experiments in populations; it is important to select a battery of PMN agonists that have clinical relevance. In our laboratory, three PMN agonists have been chosen to study PMN O2 release in trauma patients: fMLP , PAF, and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) patient

## fMLP

fMLP is a bacterial wall tripeptide that is commonly used as receptor-dependent activator of the PMN NADPH oxidase. Because fMLP is a bacterial fMLP has particular relevance when attempting to understand the ability of PMNs to respond to an infectious challenge after severe injury. Fig: 3 depicts fMLP dose-response curves in which fMLP is employed to activate PMN 02 release. Lowdose fMLP (i.e., 1 nM) does not activate PMN 02 release (68); however, doses of 100 nM and 1 jM induce an immediate O2 release which persists for 1 to 3 min. Because of this reproducible response to fMLP, fMLP is commonly used to deter mine whether PMNs have been previously primed (45, 69) In the studics performed in our laboratory, a fMLP dose of 1 (encircled in Fig. 3) is employed.

## PAF

PAF, mammalian cells via either plasma membrane  remodeling pathway involving phospholipase Az or by de novo synthesis (70) It is an important mediator of the inflammatory response to ischemia-reperfusion injuries seen after major trauma Or messengers in a manner similar to other membrane receptors (71, 72). On a molar basis; PAF is considerably less than even at high doses (e.g., 1 uM), PAF-stimulated PMN do not generate the quan tities of 02 that are seen after stimulation with fMLP (Fig:. 4 (71, 73, 74)). However, at a wide range of doses from 1 nM to We have chosen 20 nM as our priming dose, because, at this concentration; PAF alone does not activate PMN 02 release (encircled in Fig. 4) tor potent

Dose-response kinetics of fMLP-induced O2 release by resting PMN Extracellular release of Oz in peripheral blood PMNs isolated from normal, healthy; adult volunteers; and incubated in the presence of various concentrations of fMLP was measured in a kinetic microplate assay using an ELISA reader\_ Data represent the mean values for three different donors The y axis is optical density (OD) and the X axis time in minutes. Low dose fMLP (i.e, and 10 nM); elicited minimal Oz release, but fMLP concentrations of 100 nM and promptly activated Oz release which persisted for to 3 min. The 1 jM fMLP dose (encircled) was subsequently used in all studies as a standard stimulating dose for a receptor-dependent activation of PMN Oz release

Extracellular release of Oz in peripheral blood PMNs isolated from normal, healthy, adult volunteers and incubated in the presence of various concentrations of PAF was measured in a kinetic microplate assay using an ELISA reader. Data represent the mean values for three different donors. The y axis is optical density (OD) and the X axis time in minutes. Results indicate that PAF when used alone, is a weak activator of PMN Oz release; even at concentrations as high as 2 uM. Because 20 nM concentrations of PAF (encircled) do not activate PMN Oz release; this concentration was chosen for use in conjunction with fMLP to test whether PMNs are primable.

PMMA is DAG analog that bypasses membrane receptors and directly activates intracellular PKC. At low doses (e.g., 1 and 10 nM) PMA does not activate PMN 02 release, but at 1 maximal release of 02 in normal PMNs (Fig. 5 (69, 75, 76)). to stimulate maximal 02 release (encircled in Fig. 5). The advantage of PMA is that stimulation of the NADPH oxidase does not depend on expression or function of a cell surface receptor or the integrity of the proximal signaling pathways in the PMN. Therefore, any defect in 02 release following PMA stimulation is distal to PKC, and in most instances, is due to a failure in the assembly andlor function of the PMN NADPH oxidase .

## IlI. DEFINING PMN 02 RELEASE STATES

In order to accurately describe changes in the capacity of PMNs to release 02 after trauma; standard tests of 02 release were established to define the functional state of the PMN

FiG. 5 Dose-response kinetics of PMA-induced 02 release by resting PMN Extracellular release of Oz in peripheral blood PMNs isolated from normal, healthy, adult volunteers and incubated in the presence of various concentrations of PMA was measured in a kinetic microplate assay using an ELISA reader Data represent the mean values for three different donors. The y axis is optical density (OD) and the X axis time in minutes Results indicate that low dose PMA, i.e nM, caused minimal O2 release; but doses from 10 nM to JM, activated continuous Oz release after an initial lag period of 1 to 3 min. A dose of 1 uM PMA (encircled) was used in all subsequent studies as a standard stimulating dose for receptor-independent   activation of PMN Oz release.

NADPH oxidase. As first  step, 02 release responses   of PMNs isolated from the peripheral blood of 20 healthy donors were assessed under four conditions: a) basal (no agonist); b) stimulated with fMLP alone ( +fMLP); c) pretreated with PAF and then stimulated with fMLP +PAF+fMLP); and d) stimulated with PMA alone +PMA) The results of the four tests on healthy donor PMNs are depicted in the top row of graphs in Fig. 6. Representative PMN 02 release patterns were there after selected from different trauma patients to illustrate alterations in PMN function after severe injury (Fig. 6, bottom row of graphs). Based on these normal and abnormal = responses, the following four tests were established to assess PMN 02 release as follows:

## Basal O2 release

To determine whether PMNs are unactivated or activated, 02 release is assayed in the absence of any stimulation:. Quiescent; normal PMNs release little or no 02 max = an increased basal production of 02 even in the absence of exogenous stimulation with fMLP or PMA (Fig. 6A, bottom panel) .

6. In vitro PMN O2 response to the standard battery of PMN agonists, fMLP, PAF and PMA. Extracellular release of Oz in peripheral blood PMNs isolated from normal, healthy, adult volunteers was measured in Data represent kinetics of O2 release from normal PMNs from healthy donors (top panels) and from patients suffering major torso trauma (bottom panels). The y axis is optical density (OD) and the x axis time in minutes. Basal (unstimulated) expression of PMN O2 is depicted in column A; PMNs from normal volunteers (top panel) released minimal amounts of O2 while PMNs from the trauma patients (bottom panel) were endogenously activated and elaborated O2 in the absence of agonists.  Column B depicts PMNs that have been stimulated with fMLP in order to determine whether PMNs were unprimed (top) or "endogenously primed"  (bottom): Column C represents PMNs exposed to +PAF+fMLP in order to determine PAF can prime PMNs in vitro (top panel) or fails to augment the fMLP response (bottom panel). Column D shows the ability of +PMA to induce O2 production in PMNs from normal volunteers (top panel) and from a trauma patient whose PMNs were not activatable (bottom panel). The scale of the y axis is the same for column through C, but the scale of the y axis in column D is one log (10-fold) greater . FIG\_

## fMLP-induced 02 release

To determine whether PMNs are unprimed or primed, PMN 02 release is quantitated after   exposure to 1 fMLP . Unprimed PMNs from normal donors release a modest amount of 02 when stimulated with fMLP (V max = 60 + 06 nmol of PMN, p 001, compared to unstimulated donor PMNs) (Fig. 6B, panel). However, PMNs from an individual that has elevated circulating levels of priming agent (e.g, PAF), have endogenously primed PMNs that exhibit markedly enhanced release of 02 compared to normal individuals who have unprimed PMNs (Fig: 6B, bottom panel) . 106 top

## PAF+fMLP-induced 02 release

To determine whether PMNs can be primed in vitro (i.e. exogenously primable) 02 release is assayed after incubation of PMNs with 20 nM PAF for 5 min, followed by activation with 1 PMNs that are isolated from normal individuals   and incubated with PAF to fMLP stimulation have + 11.29 enhancement of the fMLP response, compared to PMNs stimulated with 1 JM fMLP alone (p 001) (compare top panels of 6, B and C). PMNs that have been primed endogenously (i.e., exhibit markedly enhanced in vitro 02 release after stimulation with fMLP alone) are unable to further enhance in vitro release when primed and activated by the exogenous addition of a PAF+fMLP combination (compare bottom panels of 6, B and C). Such PMNs have been maximally in vivo. In some trauma patients; PMNs   release  only modest amount of 02 in response to fMLP activation, yet addition of the PAF+fMLP combination does not enhance 02 release. Under these circumstances the failure of PAF to enhance fMLP-induced 02 release suggests PMN dysfunction. Such unresponsiveness may indicate PMN defects at the level of either plasma membrane receptor, postreceptor signal transduction, or the NADPH oxidase. prior Fig 02 Fig; primed

## PMA-induced 02 release

In order to eliminate the possibility that diminished produc tion of 02 are duc to dysfunction of cell surface receptors for fMLP andJor PAF, o to a defect in proximal signal transduction, PMNs should be activated with PMA, because PMA enters the cell in receptor-independent fashion and directly activates PKC. Therefore, activation of PMNs with 1 uM PMA elicits a maximal 02 release if the NADPH oxidase is intact. Normal PMNs continuously produce amounts of 02 after activation by PMA (V max 6.41 36 02 /min/1.3 106 PMNs; p &lt; 001, compared to the response obtained with PAF panel). Decreased 02 release after PMA activation suggests a deficiency in a vital component(s) of the NADPH oxidase or an inability of one or more of the oxidase components to be assembled on the plasma membrane (Fig: 6D, bottom panel). large top

The results of the four tests of PMN 02 release were then integrated to characterize the functional state of the NADPH oxidase as either: 1) resting, 2) primed, 3) activated, Or 4) unresponsive (Table 1)

Resting\_Peripheral blood PMNs that are harvested from normal individuals that, when subjected to the battery of agonists, are found to be a) unactivated; b) unprimed, c) primable,

PMN O2 release was determined under resting conditions (Basal) , in response to stimulation with fMLP alone (+fMLP); in response to combination of PAF and fMLP (+PAF+fMLP); or in response to stim ulation with PMA (+PMA). The amount of O2 released is depicted as: nonelminimal; modest; ++ enhanced; maximal. Based upon the response pattern to the four tests, PMNs were categorized as resting, primed, activated, or unresponsive (the defining tests for each category are highlighted).

## IV. MEASURING PMN O2 RELEASE IN TRAUMA PATIENTS

We have utilized the above strategy of quantitating the PMN 02 response to agonists in order to define the functional status of neutrophils over time in patients, and compared their results with that of healthy volunteers whose PMN NADPH oxidase was in the resting state, as described in Section III.

## Trauma patients

In preliminary feasibility study, blood was sampled from trauma  (Injury Severity Score &gt;15; Glasgow Coma Score &gt;8) at 3,6, 12, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h postinjury. Half of the patients had a bowel injury on admission, two developed intra-abdominal abscesses on 4, and one developed MOF on day 3. PMNs were separated   by density   gradient   technique isopaquel dextran (77) and extracellular 02 release was measured by the same techniques used for normal controls. As can be seen in release, both with   and without agonists, day using

changed significantly over time. Basal 02 release in unstimu lated PMNs from these trauma patients was increased at 6, 12, and 24 h after injury, suggesting that PMN became enously activated by 6 h and remained activated up to 24 h postinjury (Fig: 7A) The PMN 02 response to in vitro fMLP activation was increased at 3, 6, 12, and 24 h, suggesting that circulating PMNs were also primed from 3 to 24 h postinjury (Fig. 7B) However, beyond 24 h after  injury, PMN were neither  endogenously activated nor primed.  Exogenous PAF priming resulted in an insignificant increase in fMLP-induced 02 release   during  the  first 4 days   after injury (Fig. Compared to the 02 response of normal donor PMNs exposed to PAF+fMLP (1539 of the response to fMLP alone) trauma patient' s PMNs were not primable. Initially, (i.e., during the first 24 h after injury), PMNs from trauma patients appeared to be maximally primed endogenously. Beyond 24 h, PMNs did not these PMNs   still   could not be primed by the  addition of were either effete Or unresponsive to standard   receptor-dependent   agonists. The PMN response to PMA was greater than control at 3 and 6 h postinjury , suggesting an increased capacity for 02 release (Fig. 7D). In contrast, at 48, 72, and 96 h after injury, the endogthey

PMA-induced 02 response was less than that   of control PMNs .

Taken together, the 02 responses to the battery of agonists;, when measured over time, indicate that the pattern of PMN 02 release is biphasic after major torso trauma\_ During the first 24 h postinjury, PMNs are endogenously primed and activated; presumably as consequence of an outpouring of proinflam matory mediators in response to the injury. These PMNs appeared to have been maximally primed endogenously (e.gPMNs were not further primable by in vitro exposure to PAF), and the maximal 02 release response to PMA was also increased.  Subsequently, however (48-96 h postinjury) PMNs appeared to be neither endogenously activated nor primed, were unresponsive to PAF; and were  also significantly  less responsive to PMA These findings suggest that during this second phase, postinjury PMNs have a defect in 02 production that is distal to PKC in the signal transduction pathway. they

tors, membrane receptors, signal transduction, and the PMN NADPH oxidase enzyme complex involved in the generation of 02 has   increased   exponentially.  Although the data are complex, understanding such information is necessary if clin ical investigators are to develop effective therapeutic strategies designed to modulate expression of 02 by PMNs. From our data, as well as others, it appears that trauma patients have early PMN   hyperactivity   which makes   them   vulnerable to PMN-mediated organ injury. In contrast, beyond 24-48 h, trauma patients'   PMNs appear to be hyporesponsive, which places them at higher risk for infections. In order to intervene intelligently, characterization of the functional status of PMNs at various times after trauma may be very critical. For example, our data indicate that circulating PMNs have become primed by 3 h after injury, and that attempts to block PMN priming beyond 3 h injury may be   futile. In addition, if this early window of PMN priming is indeed narrow (i.e. PMNs are not endogenously   primed   beyond 24 h  postinjury) it may be prudent to postpone avoidable second hits, such as internal fixation of bone fractures, for at least 24 h. Unfortunately, not all second hits can be avoided, and, in these situations, alternative strategies might be employed.  First, the effects of proinflammatory   mediators on PMNs can be blocked in an PMNs. Soluble receptors for cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-œ, have been cloned and administered parenterally in an attempt to neutralize tumor necrosis factor-œ and prevent PMN activation (78). Similarly,  several PAF receptor   antagonists have been developed that can prevent PAF-mediated activation of PMNs in vitro, and an active search is underway for less toxic compounds for clinical use (79-81). However, numerous inflammatory mediators (e.g., PAF, leukotriene B4, interleukin-8, interleukin-6, interferon-Y, and CSa) are released after trauma which can andfor activate the release of PMN O2 (45, 82-86). It is, therefore, unlikely that the use of a single would be effective in preventing endogenous expression of PMN 02 \_ A second strategy would be to prevent seques long prime drug

tration of primed PMNs. Monoclonal antibodies directed against PMN surface membrane adhesion receptors such as the Bz-integrins, may be useful in preventing tight adherence of PMNs to endothelial cells, thereby preventing 02 release in close proximity of the endothelial cells and reducing injury (87). Recent evidence suggests that adhered PMNs may be dislodged   from   endothelial cells   by monoclonal   antibodies directed against the ß2-chain of the integrin receptors (88). A third strategy might be to down-regulate 02 release by modulating signal transduction or manipulating components of the NADPH oxidase. While   this   complex arena has not been explored therapeutically, it may prove to be the most economical and effective; because this is a final common pathway through which multiple mediators up-regulate 02 production: For example; one method would be to block production of one Or more components of the PMN oxidase. Shaked et al. (89) have recently shown that levels of p47-phox and p67-phox are increased after trauma and that elevations of these two cytosolic proteins are associated with enhanced 02 release. Modulators that down-regulate gene expression of p47-phox and p67-phox could be expected to decrease the ability of PMNs to assemble a functional oxidase and generate 02 .

Therapeutic interventions later in the   postinjury   period, however, may require diametric approach. Previous work from our laboratories in patients with major trauma or burns indicate that the proliferation of bone marrow phagocyte progenitors is depressed (9, 90). Additionally, several investigators have documented that various PMN functions (e.g , chenonspecific cellular immunity, which has been associated with an increased risk of infection. At this stage it may be appropriate to enhance PMN function:  Again, rather than embark empirically, it is more appropriate to develop treatment strategies designed to correct identifiable and quantifiable PMN defects.  For example, if receptor-mediated   signaling is de pressed,  this may be amplified, or if the NADPH oxidase system is defective; it may be repaired. For example, preliminary studies from our laboratory in patients with severe trauma or burn injury have identified defects in the cytosolic components of the NADPH oxidase (91). Specifically, careful studies of 02 production in a sodium dodecyl sulfate cell-free system has demonstrated a decreased level of p47-phox in the cytosol harvested   from severely   injured and trauma patients. Interestingly, addition of recombinant human p47 to the cytosolic preparation of these PMNs restores 02 production to normal   levels. This acquired   defect in p47-phox is similar to congenital deficiency of p47-phox that has been identified in children with a rare variant of chronic granulomatous disease, who are at high risk for clinical infections with fatal consequence (39). Cioffi et al. (92) have reported that administration of granulocyte macrophage-colony stimu lating factor (GM-CSF) to burn patients enhances PMN 02 production,   and preliminary studies in PMN from severely burned patients in our burn unit suggest that patients receiving GM-CSF  may maintain  normal   levels of p47-phox in the cytosol and express normal levels of 02 (unpublished data). burn

In summary, characterization of the functional state of the PMN oxidase is more than an academic exercise practiced by neutrophil physiologists. Subjecting PMN to battery of ago nists and then characterizing the functional status of the PMN allows insights into the competence of clinical relevant cell surface   receptors, the fidelity of signal transduction and the functional status of the NADPH oxidase itself. Based on such insights, the clinician may be better able to design a treatment strategy that will favorably modulate PMN function after major trauma and reduce the incidence and/or severity of complica tions such as adult respiratory distress syndrome, MOF, and sepsis.
