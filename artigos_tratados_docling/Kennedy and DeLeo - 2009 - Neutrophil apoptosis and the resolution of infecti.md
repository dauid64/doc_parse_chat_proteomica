Abstract Polymorphonuclear  leukocytes  (PMNs)  are  the  most  abundant  white  cell  in humans and an essential component of the innate immune system. PMNs are typically the W rst type of leukocyte recruited to sites of infection or areas of in X ammation. Ingestion of microorganisms triggers production of reactive oxygen species and fusion of cytoplasmic granules  with  forming  phagosomes,  leading  to  e V ective  killing  of  ingested  microbes. Phagocytosis of bacteria typically accelerates neutrophil apoptosis, which ultimately promotes the resolution of infection. However, some bacterial pathogens alter PMN apoptosis to survive and thereby cause disease. Herein, we review PMN apoptosis and the ability of microorganisms to alter this important process.

## Introduction

Polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs or neutrophils) are the most abundant leukocyte in humans and typically the W rst type of white cell recruited to sites of infection. Neutrophils are  the  primary  cellular  defense  against  bacterial  and  fungal  infections.  PMNs  ingest microbes  by  a  process  known  as  phagocytosis,  and  the  ingested  microorganisms  are destroyed by the combination of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cytotoxic components of granules [1-4] (Fig. 1). This task is facilitated by the numerous receptors enriched on the cell surface and proin X ammatory stimuli.

On the other hand, PMNs contain or produce many cytotoxic molecules that can cause signi W cant damage to host tissues/organs if the in X ammatory response is not tightly regulated. Resolution of the in X ammatory response is a complex process and includes production of

host-derived  anti-in X ammatory  mediators  and  apoptosis  of  PMNs.  Speci W cally,  PMN apoptosis and removal of apoptotic PMNs by macrophages is a mechanism to clear e V ete neutrophils and ultimately facilitate the resolution of in X ammation.

This  review  highlights  two  areas  of  neutrophil  biology  related  to  immune  system homeostasis  and  the  innate  host  defense,  namely,  PMN  apoptosis  and  the  ability  of microbes to manipulate this process, and the resolution of the acute in X ammatory response, including clearance of apoptotic cells by macrophages.

## Granulocytes, granulopoiesis, and the development of myeloid cells

Granulocytes  (basophils,  eosinophils,  and  neutrophils)  can  be  di V erentiated  physically  from lymphocytes  and other circulating  leukocytes  based  upon  multiple  phenotypes,  such  as  the presence of characteristic granules in the cytoplasm, a multilobed nucleus and speci W c cell surface markers (Fig. 2, top panels). Development of granulocytes involves transcription factors distinct  from  those  that  facilitate  lymphocyte  maturation  [5-9].  Many of these  transcription factors are required for granule protein maturation and ligands essential for PMN activation, as di V erent  granules  appear  during  separate  stages  of  PMN  development  ([9],  reviewed in [1, 10]). Secondary or speci W c granules predominate in mature neutrophils, whereas the relative number of azurophilic or primary granules decreases during granulocyte maturation [11].

Circulating leukocytes and other cells of the immune system develop from pluripotent stem cells located in bone marrow [12]. Granulocytes di V erentiation proceeds through a

concerted  series  of  steps  that  include  granule  formation  and  ultimately  exit  of  mature PMNs from bone marrow to peripheral blood [1, 9-11, 13-18]. This maturation and di V erentiation process takes » 6.5 days and is called granulopoiesis, i.e., the formation of granulocytes [11]. Although PMNs have a relatively short life span, the greatest percentage of hematopoiesis is committed to the production of neutrophils--nearly 60% of all leukocytes in  bone  marrow  are  granulocyte  precursors.  Mature  PMNs  are  terminally  di V erentiated cells and circulate in the bloodstream for » 10-24 h before migrating into tissues [15-18]. Neutrophils may function for an additional 1-2 days in tissues before undergoing apoptosis [11, 17] and are then cleared by macrophages [19, 20]. Remarkably, PMN turnover is on the order of 10 11 cells per day in the average adult human [15].

## Recruitment of neutrophils from the bloodstream

Neutrophil recruitment, priming, and extravasation

Neutrophils  survey venules  and  lymphatic  organs for signs  of invading  microorganisms and/or host tissue injury and in X ammation. These 'signs' are often chemoattractants, host- or

microorganism-derived molecules recognized by receptors on the cell surface. Chemoattractants recruit PMNs to sites of infection or areas of tissue damage. Most chemoattractants, such as IL-8, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and N-formylated peptides (e.g., fMLP), also prime neutrophils for enhanced function (see Table 1 in [21]).

Neutrophil priming was originally de W ned as the ability of a primary agonist such as LPS to enhance superoxide production by a secondary stimulus [22]. Secretory vesicles, gelatinase-containing granules, and a limited population of speci W c granules fuse with the plasma membrane during priming [23], thereby enriching the cell surface with receptors important for host defense and the in X ammatory response. Primed cells can be di V erentiated from unprimed cells in part by distinct cell morphology, e.g., cell size and/or granularity by X ow cytometry, or increased expression of surface receptors such as CD11b [24]. Some priming agents are agonists or ligands of TLRs, and in vitro and in vivo experiments have shown that TLRs are critical for PMN priming as well as pathogen recognition [25].

Neutrophils enter sites of infection by exiting peripheral circulation through the endothelial wall in a process called extravasation. This process is initiated by selectins, a C-type lectin family of glycoproteins that are expressed on activated endothelial cells (E- and P-selectin), platelets (P-selectin), and primed/activated PMNs (L-selectin, CD62). As part of the in X ammatory response, E- and P-selectin become up-regulated on endothelial cells and interact with L-selectin expressed on the surface of neutrophils. This initial interaction, called 'tethering,' facilitates subsequent rolling of PMNs along the surface of the endothelium. Rolling is followed by W rm adhesion promoted by CD11b/CD18 [26] and CD54 [27], and transmigration is mediated in part by CD31 [28], CD54 [27], CD44 [29], and CD47 [30]. Following extravasation, there are several possible fates for PMNs related to apoptosis and turnover, and these are discussed in detail below.

## PMN microbicidal activity

PMNs destroy pathogens through a series of well-coordinated steps that result in the production of ROS and enrichment of phagosomes with cytotoxic molecules from cytoplasmic granules (called degranulation) (Fig. 1). ROS are derived from superoxide produced by a multisubunit enzyme complex called NADPH oxidase (reviewed in [3]). The phagocyte NADPH oxidase is composed of at least 7 proteins that reside in cytosolic and membrane compartments  in  resting  PMNs.  During  cell  activation,  cytosolic  oxidase  components translocate  to  the  phagosome  membrane  and  associate  with  the  membrane  component, X avocytochrome b 558 , to form the assembled NADPH oxidase. NADPH oxidase assembly and activation is regulated by multiple signaling events, including phosphorylation of one of the cytosolic proteins, p47 phox , and several SH3-domain interactions [3, 31]. NADPH oxidase catalyzes the formation of superoxide (O 2 ¡ ),  which dismutates rapidly to H O , 2 2 although O 2 ¡ and H O 2 2 are weakly microbicidal [2].

As the phagosome forms/matures, granule components such as myeloperoxidase (MPO) accumulate in the phagosome [11]. MPO catalyzes a reaction with H O 2 2 and chloride to form hypochlorous acid (HOCl) and other secondarily derived ROS such as OH·and singlet oxygen [32]. Neutrophil cytoplasts--neutrophils lacking nuclei and depleted of cytoplasmic  granules--retain  a  respiratory  burst,  but  lack  MPO.  Odell  and  Segal  reported  that cytoplasts phagocytose Staphylococcus aureus , but bacteria are not killed unless they are coated with MPO [33]. MPO activity is inhibited by azide, and to a lesser extent cyanide, and this inhibition decreases killing of bacteria by neutrophils [34].

Landmark work by Rosen and Klebano V [35] demonstrated that the key antimicrobial components  of  human  PMNs,  NADPH  oxidase  and  the  MPO-halide  system,  serve  as redundant mechanisms to kill ingested microbes. Consistent with this notion, MPO de W -ciency in humans does not necessarily correlate with morbidity from infections (reviewed in [4]). PMNs from MPO-de W cient individuals retain microbicidal activity against several bacterial pathogens, although at a lower rate than PMNs from normal donors [4]. Collectively, these W ndings suggest that a combination of mechanisms is necessary for optimal killing of microbes.

In addition to the intracellular proteins that degrade the ingested microbes, the surface of  PMNs  is  decorated  with  multiple  receptors  that  bind  to  foreign  particles,  including those that bind pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Many pattern recognition  receptors  (PRRs)  do  not  promote  phagocytosis  directly,  although  they  do  prime phagocytes  for  enhanced  uptake/activation  or  function  as  co-receptors.  For  example, TLRs  recognize  numerous  PAMPs  [36],  but  there  is  little  data  available  to  show  that TLRs  promote  phagocytosis  directly  (reviewed  in  [37]).  By  comparison,  neutrophil dectin-1 [38], a C-type lectin PRR, binds /afii9826 -glucan residues on fungi and this interaction triggers phagocytosis [39]. Phagocytosis of unopsonized /afii9826 -glucan particles is morphologically di V erent than phagocytosis of complement-opsonized zymosan, suggesting that signal transduction  following  these  receptor-ligand  interactions  is  distinct  [39].  Importantly, dectin-1 mediated phagocytosis elicits ROS production and degranulation, and ultimately killing of fungi [39].

## PMN apoptosis and the resolution of the acute in X ammatory response

Normal turnover of cells, regardless of type or tissue location, is governed by apoptosis, and defects in apoptosis lead to profound and devastating conditions ranging from cancer to autoimmune  diseases.  Neutrophils  undergo  constitutive  or  spontaneous  apoptosis  as  a mechanism to maintain immune system homeostasis [19]. Importantly, PMN apoptosis is accompanied by a general decrease in cell function and proin X ammatory capacity, which is key to non-in X ammatory removal of e V ete cells [40, 41]. Neutrophil apoptosis can be initiated by extrinsic pathway stimuli (extracellular, e.g., tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF /afii9825 ) or FAS ligand) or intrinsic pathway stimuli (intracellular, e.g., ROS and/or that mediated by mitochondria). Neutrophil apoptosis is a non-in X ammatory process characterized by loss of cytoplasmic granules, rounding of the nucleus, and condensation of nuclear heterochromatin [19, 20] (Fig. 2, lower panels). PMNs also undergo apoptosis after phagocytosis, a process  also  known  as  phagocytosis-induced  cell  death  (PICD,  see  below).  Apoptotic neutrophils are subsequently ingested by macrophages, providing the means to resolve the in X ammatory response without releasing cytotoxic molecules that would otherwise damage host tissues. Phagocytosis of apoptotic PMNs was W rst observed by Elie Metchniko V in the 19th century [42].

## Spontaneous (constitutive) PMN apoptosis

PMN apoptosis can  be  induced  through  multiple  mechanisms  (Fig. 3a,  b).  Spontaneous neutrophil apoptosis is an intrinsic  process,  meaning  that  the  signal  to  initiate  apoptosis originates from within the cell (Fig. 3a). Many proteins and/or molecules are known to regulate constitutive PMN apoptosis and only a few examples are provided here. For example, MCL1 is a key BCL2-family protein located in the nucleus and cytoplasm of PMNs [43-45].

<!-- image -->

As  senescent  neutrophils  undergo  apoptosis,  MCL1  levels  decline  rapidly,  presumably degraded by the proteasome (and there is a concurrent decrease in MCL1 mRNA), suggesting neutrophil survival is regulated by MCL1 expression [46].

Src homology 2 domain-containing inositol 5 -phosphatase (SHIP-1) is an intracellular ' protein critical for signal transduction during PMN apoptosis [47]. The molecule is a negative regulator of immune receptor and cytokine and growth factor receptor signaling [48]. SHIP-1 is recruited to the plasma membrane of myeloid cells after ligation of CD18 [49], and this initiates an anti-apoptotic signaling cascade that requires the Src kinase Lyn and

the  anti-apoptotic  protein,  Akt [48]. Ship-1 ¡ ¡ / mice have increased numbers of myeloid cells and form lung granulomas after infection [50]. It was proposed that the granulomas fail to resolve because Ship-1 ¡ ¡ / cells display enhanced survival and proliferation [50].

BCL2A1 is another  protein  important  for  PMN  survival.  Like  MCL1,  BCL2A1  is  a member of the BCL2 family of proteins, and BCL2A1 mRNA is constitutively expressed in human neutrophils [51]. PMN BCL2A1 is up-regulated by G-CSF or LPS, agonists known to  promote neutrophil survival [51]. Promyelocytic HL-60 cells have increased BCL2A1 mRNA after neutrophilic di V erentiation with all-trans retinoic acid [51], suggesting that the protein has an important role in mature neutrophils.

BCL2-associated  X  protein  (BAX)  interacts  with  the  mitochondria,  an  intracellular organelle  known  to  regulate  PMN  survival  [52,  53].  In  contrast  to  BCL2A1,  BAX  is  a BCL2-family member that promotes neutrophil apoptosis. Upon translocation to the mitochondria,  BAX  is  cleaved  by  calpain-1  to  an  18-kDa  fragment  unable  to  interact  with BCL2 family members, thereby promoting apoptosis [54, 55]. Inhibition of BAX cleavage in  vivo  leads  to  increased  and  prolonged  in X ammation,  indicating  that  the  protein  is required for the resolution of acute in X ammation [52]. Using BAX antisense gene silencing, Dibbert et al. showed that PMN apoptosis is delayed in several human in X ammatory diseases and there is an associated decrease in BAX protein expression [56].

Soluble extracellular factors also in X uence spontaneous PMN apoptosis [57]. For example, macrophage migration inhibitory factor is a proin X ammatory cytokine that delays cleavage of BAX and ultimately neutrophil apoptosis [58]. PMNs stimulated with G-CSF or GMCSF  have  decreased  expression  of  BAX,  suggesting  the  anti-apoptotic  e V ect  of  these cytokines is in part related to inhibition of BAX. GM-CSF and G-CSF also preserve the chemotaxis and phagocytosis capacity of PMNs aged in vitro [40, 59], indicating inhibition of apoptosis is tied to the preservation of PMN function.

In  addition  to  BAX  activity,  mitochondria  regulate  their  transmembrane  potential, which is critical for cell survival. As depicted in Fig. 3a, ROS and oxidative stress can lead to  PMN apoptosis through disruption of mitochondria transmembrane potential [60-65]. Neutrophil mitochondria contain calpain-1 and its release can activate pro-apoptotic factors or degrade anti-apoptotic proteins [66]. Although human neutrophils express low levels of cytochrome c ,  it  plays  an  important  role  in  apoptosis  [65].  As  cytochrome c is  released from the mitochondria, it associates with apoptotic protease-activating factor 1 (APAF-1) and initiates apoptosis [53].

Several distal e V ector proteins participate in apoptosis. Caspase 3, caspase 8, and caspase 9 trigger  proteolytic  cascades  that  result  in  the  apoptotic  death  of  human  neutrophils  [67] (Fig. 3b).  The  importance  of  neutrophil  caspases  in  in X ammation is illustrated in  a  recent study by Tanejo et al. [68], in which it was reported that individuals with bacterial sepsis have signi W cant reduction of caspase-3 and caspase-9 activities and decreased neutrophil apoptosis.

These are only a few speci W c examples of the molecules known to regulate spontaneous neutrophil apoptosis and overlap exists with extrinsic pathway stimuli as described below.

## FAS/FAS ligand-mediated apoptosis

In  contrast to spontaneous PMN apoptosis, FAS-mediated, TNF /afii9825 -mediated and TRAILmediated  apoptosis  proceed  by  an  extrinsic  pathway,  as  an  extracellular  signal  initiates apoptosis (Fig. 3b). Extrinsic pathway signals are usually soluble protein factors that bind to membrane-bound receptors on the cell surface and trigger apoptosis. FAS (CD95) is the nidus of the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) and is expressed on the surface of neutrophils as well as on virtually all other cells in humans [69]. Neutrophils also express

FAS ligand (FASL, CD95L) [70], and FASL-FAS interaction initiates PMN apoptosis in a caspase-dependent manner. Because PMNs express FAS and soluble FASL, PMN apoptosis is triggered through autocrine and paracrine pathways. FAS-mediated PMN apoptosis can be suppressed by GM-CSF, G-CSF, interferon-gamma (IFN /afii9828 ), TNF /afii9825 , and the tyrosine kinase  inhibitors  herbimycin  A  and  genistein  [70],  thus  highlighting  the  complexity  of signaling pathways involved in regulating neutrophil turnover.

FAS is a transmembrane protein containing a FASL-binding extracellular domain and FAS-associated death domain (FADD) on its intracellular region. Interaction of FASL with FAS leads to clustering of FADDs on the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane, which, in turn, leads to caspase activation and apoptosis. As with many other signaling receptor complexes, e.g., T- and B-cell receptors, current evidence indicates that FAS accumulates in cholesterol-rich membrane domains called lipid rafts and that clustering of these receptors leads to caspase-8 activation and, ultimately, cell death. Macrophages also secrete FASL in response  to  phagocytosis  [71].  Secretion  of  FASL  by  macrophages  induces  leukocyte apoptosis  in  a  paracrine  manner  and  assists  further  with  the  resolution  of  in X ammation [71].  For  example,  Jimenez  et al.  studied  patients  with  systemic  in X ammatory  response syndrome,  and  PMNs  from  these  patients  have  decreased  FAS-mediated  apoptosis  and accompanying tissue damage following bacterial infections, presumably from the accumulation of activated neutrophils that release tissue degrading enzymes [72].

## TNF  receptor (TNFR)-mediated apoptosis /afii9825

The TNFR is a transmembrane protein containing an extracellular TNF /afii9825 binding domain and a  TNFR-associated death domain (TRADD) in the cytoplasmic region of the protein [73] (Fig. 3b).  Neutrophils  express  two  TNFRs,  TNFRSF1A  (55-R,  CD120a,  or  TNFRI)  and TNFSFR1B (75-R, CD120b, or TNFRII), and each has a slightly di V erent role in PMN apoptosis. Gon et al. showed that TNFRI is required for TNF /afii9825 -mediated PMN apoptosis and its ability to promote apoptosis is enhanced by TNFRII [74]. Blocking TNFRI but not TNFRII with speci W c antibodies inhibits neutrophil apoptosis [74]. Additional work has shown that TNFRI is dominant using TNFR-selective mutants [75]. As with FADDs, TRADDs cluster in lipid rafts during TNFR-TNF /afii9825 binding. This clustering of signaling molecules leads to the recruitment of adaptor molecules and activation of transcription factors. Although similar to FAS/FASL-mediated apoptosis in many ways, one major di V erence is that TNF /afii9825 receptormediated apoptosis does not depend solely on caspase activation [76].

TNF  can elicit in /afii9825 X ammatory or anti-in X ammatory e V ects depending on the type of cell with which it interacts. Notably, TNF /afii9825 has been shown to have both pro-apoptotic and antiapoptotic e V ects toward neutrophils. Van den Berg et al. showed that this bi-polar e V ect is concentration  dependent  [77].  At  low  concentrations  ( · 0.1 ng/ml),  TNF /afii9825 delays  PMN apoptosis and elicits production of proin X ammatory cytokines, whereas at higher concentrations TNF /afii9825 initiates apoptosis [77]. Consistent with these observations, high concentrations of TNF /afii9825 (10-100 ng/ml) override the ability of IFN /afii9828 and GM-CSF to delay apoptosis [77]. Moreover, the ability of TNF /afii9825 to induce neutrophil apoptosis was linked to ROS production, since PMNs from patients with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD, see below) and PMN cytoplasts fail to undergo apoptosis in the presence of high concentrations of TNF   [76,  77].  Individuals  with  TNFR-associated  periodic  syndrome  (TRAPS)  have  a /afii9825 defect in the TNFR and, therefore, diminished TNF /afii9825 -induced PMN apoptosis [78]. Patients with  TRAPS  experience  recurrent  fever  attacks  lasting &gt;1 week  that  is  associated  with abdominal pain, severe arthromyalgias, rash, and periorbital edema. However, TRAPS has not been associated with increased infection [78].

## TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)

Our understanding of TRAIL-induced PMN apoptosis is relatively recent compared to that of FAS- or TNF-receptor-mediated apoptosis. Five TRAIL receptors (TRAIL-R1, TRAILR2,  TRAIL-R3,  TRAIL-R4,  and  TRAIL-R5)  have  been  identi W ed  and  PMNs  express TRAIL-R2  and  TRAIL-R3  constitutively  [79,  80].  Of  the W ve  TRAIL  receptors,  only TRAIL-R1  and  TRAIL-R2  have  the  ability  to  induce  pro-apoptotic,  caspase-dependent signaling (Fig. 3b), whereas TRAIL-R3 and TRAIL-R4 are decoy receptors that lack the ability  to  induce  apoptosis  [81].  TRAIL-R3  and  TRAIL-R4  do  not  have  intact  death domains and these receptors have been proposed to serve as 'decoys' that inhibit apoptosis either by sequestering TRAIL or by complexing with TRAIL-R1 or TRAIL-R2 upon binding to the ligand. Either mechanism would inhibit apoptosis, but there is paucity of data to provide conclusive support to this notion. TRAIL-induced apoptosis appears important for senescent PMNs that preferentially home to bone marrow after circulating in peripheral blood [82]. Trail ¡ ¡ / mice  have  an  enhanced susceptibility to autoimmune diseases [83], and Trail blocked experimentally in animal models exacerbates in X ammation caused by type  1  diabetes  [84]  and  autoimmune  encephalomyelitis  [85].  PMNs  also  express  and secrete TRAIL, which has been implicated in host defense against virus-infected cells and tumor  cells  [86].  IFN /afii9828 up-regulates  TRAIL  expression  and  IFN /afii9828 -activated  PMNs  store TRAIL in an intracellular pool that is mobilized following exposure to proin X ammatory mediators  [79,  87,  88].  TRAIL  expressed  and  secreted  by  PMNs  acts  in  an  autocrine manner to induce apoptosis [87].

## Down-regulation of proin X ammatory capacity

PMNs  produce  numerous  cytokines  and  chemokines  following  phagocytosis,  including TNF  and  IL-8,  which  contribute  to  the  in /afii9825 X ammatory response  [89-91].  Production  of these molecules is regulated in part at the level of gene expression [92, 93]. Microarraybased  studies  have  shown  that  phagocytosis  initially  up-regulates  neutrophil  transcripts encoding proteins that play an important role in the acute in X ammatory response, such as IL-1 /afii9825 ,  IL-1 /afii9826 ,  IL-1 /afii9830 ,  IL-1RN,  IL-8,  IL-10,  IL-12 /afii9826 ,  IL-15,  TNF /afii9825 ,  vascular  endothelial growth factor (VEGF), oncostatin M (OSM), IL-6, GRO /afii9826 , and GRO  [21, 94-97]. Taken /afii9828 together, these processes are critical for defense against invading microorganisms. However, once phagocytosis is complete and microbes are destroyed, these PMN functions are down-regulated coincident with the induction of apoptosis [95, 98-102]. For example, key proin X ammatory  or  signal  transduction  molecules,  including  CXCR1  and  CXCR2,  are down-regulated  during  the  initial  stages  of  apoptosis  [94].  Walcheck  et al.  have  shown recently that phagocytosis-induced neutrophil apoptosis is accompanied by shedding of L-selectin and concomitant increased surface expression of ADAM17, a metalloprotease that likely plays an important role in the down-regulation of neutrophil function [103, 104]. In general, most primary PMN functions, including chemotaxis, phagocytosis, superoxide production, and degranulation, decrease signi W cantly with apoptosis [40, 41].

## IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) transsignaling

IL-6 signals through a receptor system composed of the IL-6R, an 80 kDa transmembrane protein  that  binds  the  signaling  molecule  gp130.  Although  the  expression  of  IL-6R  is restricted to a small subset of cells, gp130 is expressed ubiquitously. IL-6 can also elicit responses through  a pathway  involving soluble IL-6R  (sIL-6R)  and this phenomenon  is

known  as  IL-6R  transsignaling.  sIL-6R  is  generated  by  either  shedding  from  the  cell surface by proteolytic cleavage or possibly alternative splicing of IL-6R mRNA [105, 106]. Chalaris et al. demonstrated that apoptosis is accompanied by the release of IL-6R from cells,  a  phenomenon  mediated  by  ADAM17  [103,  104].  sIL-6R  recruits  mononuclear phagocytes to the site of infection, which are then either directly involved in the removal of apoptotic  PMNs  or  di V erentiate  into  macrophages  that  carry  out  this  task  [107].  This process links the acute in X ammatory stage of disease and resolution of the in X ammatory response.

## Resolvins and lipoxins

Endogenous mediators termed resolvins and protectins actively participate in the dampening of host responses to orchestrate resolution of in X ammation. These endogenous mediators lend more evidence that the resolution of in X ammation is an actively regulated program rather than a passive termination of the immune response. After the initial in X ammatory response, these molecules promote recruitment of macrophages to sites of in X ammation and initiate the resolution of the acute in X ammatory response [108]. One of these mediators is known as lipoxin A4 (LXA4), which is generated from arachidonic acid via the lipoxygenase  pathways.  Together  with  the  aspirin-triggered  15-epi-LXA4  (ATL),  these  molecules are  among the W rst  to  down-regulate  PMN in W ltration  and  begin  the  'slow  down' during the course of in X ammation [109-111]. For example, lipoxins drive the resolution of in X ammation by stimulating nonphlogistic uptake of apoptotic PMNs by W xed-tissue macrophages [112].

## Removal of apoptotic PMNs by macrophages

As with removal of undesirable, autoreactive T-cells in the thymus, apoptosis is a mechanism to clear e V ete PMNs. Apoptotic cells maintain membrane integrity for a W xed period of time and need to be cleared quickly to prevent secondary necrosis and the release of cytotoxic  molecules  that  would  otherwise  cause  in X ammation  and/or  damage  to  host tissues. Clearance of apoptotic neutrophils has been studied mainly with human monocytederived macrophages [113] and mouse alveolar macrophages [114]. Although clearance of apoptotic  cells  is  not  completely  understood,  several  macrophage  receptors  have  been implicated  in  this  process  (Fig. 4).  These  molecules  include  the  phosphatidylserine  (PS) receptor [114, 115], complement receptors [116], scavenger receptors and lectins [117], the /afii9825 v /afii9826 3 /CD36/thrombospondin recognition system [118, 119], CD14 [119], and CD44 [121123]. The redundancy of removal mechanisms suggests that clearance of apoptotic neutrophils is a critical process to preserve immune system homeostasis.

## Phosphatidylserine receptor (PSR)

Transposition of PS from the inner lea X et of the plasma membrane to the outer lea X et is a traditional hallmark of cells undergoing apoptosis. Recently, Park et al. have shown that stabilin-2  serves  as  a  novel  PSR  and  that  blocking  stabilin-2  on  macrophages  inhibits phagocytosis  of  apoptotic  cells  and  causes  release  of  proin X ammatory  cytokines  [124]. Miyanishi  et al.  identi W ed  Tim4  as  a  PSR  through  the  use  of  an  antibody  library  and showed that blocking Tim4 in vivo resulted in an accumulation of apoptotic cells in the thymus and the development of autoantibodies [125]. The transcript encoding the Psr is

expressed in several tissues in mice [126]. Human and mouse macrophages express the Psr and it is required for clearance of apoptotic cells in vitro and in vivo [126-128]. Consequently, mice genetically de W cient in the gene encoding Psr have accumulation of apoptotic cells in the lung and brain during embryogenesis and develop autoimmune diseases [126, 129]. It is possible that the generation of autoimmune diseases in these models results from the pool of apoptotic cells that releases autoantigens over time.

## Complement receptors

The human complement cascade can be activated by antibodies (classical pathway) or by oligosaccharide antigens on microbes or apoptotic cells (lectin and alternative pathways) (reviewed in [130]). Each of the complement cascades is a sequential, proteolytic cascade that  results  in  opsonization  of  targets  with  C3b(i)  and/or  lysis  of  opsonized  cell  by  the membrane attack complex (MAC). Complement proteins, speci W cally C3b and its breakdown products, bind to  apoptotic  cells,  possibly  through  the  exposure  of  PS  [116],  and altered lipid and carbohydrate moieties. This process facilitates removal of apoptotic cells from  tissues  (reviewed  in  [131]).  The  majority  of  complement  receptor  phagocytosis  is mediated through one of the four receptors that bind to complement component C3; CR1 (CD35),  CR2  (CD21),  CR3  (CD11b/CD18),  and  CR4  (CD11c/CD18).  Macrophages express CR3 and CR4 as well as the C1q receptor, which binds to the W rst component of the classical complement pathway. The importance of C3 and C1q in apoptotic cell clearance

has been shown in mice with targeted deletion of the genes encoding these receptors [129, 132].  Grevnik  et al.  reported  that  although  systemic  lupus  erythematosus  patients  have reduced total complement hemolytic activity in their sera, complement-mediated phagocytosis of apoptotic cells remained una V ected [133]. This observation can be explained by di V erential  depletion  of  speci W c  complement  components  in  the  patients,  i.e.,  reduced levels of C9 and normal levels C3.

## Vitronectin ( /afii9825 v /afii9826 3 )/CD36/thrombospondin recognition system

Vitronectin ( /afii9825 v /afii9826 3 integrin), CD36, and thrombospondin are believed to function in a complex  on  macrophages  and  promote  binding  and  uptake  of  apoptotic  cells.  Cooperation among these three antigens occurs during recognition of apoptotic PMNs by human monocyte-derived  macrophages  [118]  and  murine  bone  marrow-derived  macrophages  [113]. Thrombospondin  functions  somewhat  like  C3b  in  that  thrombospondin  binds  to  an unknown ligand on apoptotic cells, which then is recognized by the CD36/vitronectin complex expressed on macrophages. CD36 is an 88 kDa multifunctional glycoprotein, a B-type scavenger receptor, expressed by several cell types including monocytes, endothelial cells, epithelial cells, and several tumor cell lines [134]. In addition to thrombospondin, oxidized PS has recently been shown to be a ligand for CD36 [135]. Macrophage CD36, along with /afii9825 v /afii9826 3 integrin, is important for the removal of apoptotic cells during the resolution of viral infections [119]. The domain on CD36 that is critical for the removal of apoptotic cells has been localized to amino acids 155-183 [136].

## CD44

CD44 is a » 90 kDa surface protein that binds to hyaluronic acid. Ligation of CD44 generates intracellular signals that speci W cally augment clearance of apoptotic PMNs [121, 122]. For example, blocking CD44 with anti-CD44 Fab' antibodies decreases macrophage-mediated  phagocytosis  of  apoptotic  bodies  [121].  Furthermore,  CD44-de W cient  mice  have reduced capacity to clear apoptotic PMNs post-in X ammation [137].

## CD14

CD14 is a 53-55 kDa protein expressed on monocytes, on macrophages, and at relatively low levels on granulocytes. Although CD14 is a co-receptor for LPS/LPS-binding protein [138],  recent  evidence  indicates  CD14  also  binds  intercellular  adhesion  molecule-3 (ICAM-3) on leukocytes [139]. CD14 can be expressed in soluble form (sCD14) and may bind apoptotic cells and subsequently react with a sCD14 receptor on phagocytes [140]. Little is known about the role of CD14 in the removal of apoptotic PMNs; however, there is good evidence that CD14 is crucial for the removal of apoptotic lymphocytes [141, 142].

## Scavenger receptors and lectins

In addition to the X ipping of PS from the inner lea X et  to  the  outer  lea X et  of  the  plasma membrane, sugars and oxidized lipids that are exposed on the surface of apoptotic cells are modi W ed  and  recognized  as  'non-self'  by  macrophages.  These  modi W cations  are  recognized  by  scavenger  receptors  and  lectins  expressed  on  the  surface  of  macrophages  and W broblasts [143].

## Non-in X ammatory removal of apoptotic PMNs

Neutrophil apoptosis and the removal of apoptotic neutrophils is a nonphlogistic process. Phagocytosis of apoptotic cells by macrophages, monocytes, or dendritic cells causes these cell types to produce anti-in X ammatory cytokines [144, 145]. For example, macrophages exposed  to  apoptotic  cells  secrete  TGF/afii9826 , which  suppresses  LPS-mediated  release  of in X ammatory cytokines by infected cells [146]. Macrophages also secrete factors that contribute to PMN apoptosis (e.g., soluble FASL [71]) and increase expression of anti-in X ammatory factors [147]. For example, in the airway (bronchi and lungs), apoptotic PMNs are ingested by alveolar macrophages without release of in X ammatory mediators (reviewed in [148]). Moreover, engagement of apoptotic cells by CD36 on macrophages inhibits production of proin X ammatory cytokines TNF /afii9825 , IL-1 /afii9826 , and IL-12, but increases secretion of TGF/afii9826 and IL-10, both anti-in X ammatory cytokines [149].

In addition to the autologous signals that contribute to the anti-in X ammatory process, steroids--speci W cally glucocorticoids--promote a non-in X ammatory  environment during phagocytosis of apoptotic cells. Human and murine macrophages exposed to glucocorticoids for  24 h  have  enhanced  ability  to  phagocytose  apoptotic  leukocytes  [150].  Compared  to macrophages, peripheral blood monocytes have a much lower phagocytic capacity toward apoptotic cells, but incubation of human monocytes with glucocorticoids induces the phenotype of monocyte-derived macrophages much more competent to ingest apoptotic cells [19, 151]. The ability of monocytes to phagocytose apoptotic leukocytes after incubation with glucocorticoids has been linked to 11 /afii9826 -hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11 /afii9826 -HSD), a molecule not present in monocytes [152, 153]. Cytokines also in X uence phagocytic capacity of macrophages toward apoptotic cells. For instance, IFN /afii9828 inhibits the glucocorticoid-induced ability of macrophages to clear apoptotic PMNs [154].

## Factors that prolong neutrophil survival

Although neutrophil apoptosis is critical for granulocyte homeostasis and the resolution of in X ammation,  many  proin X ammatory molecules  extend  PMN  survival  during  the  initial stages of the in X ammatory response. For example, neutrophils that migrate to sites of tissue in X ammation  have  a  prolonged  lifespan  and  become  resistant  to  both  FAS-  and  TNFinduced apoptosis [155]. This delay in apoptosis likely promotes robust early response to infection or in X ammatory insult and is important because it would increase the window of time during which neutrophils can be recruited to such sites and remain fully functional.

Host-derived factors as well as bacterial and fungal products serve to delay neutrophil apoptosis. Cytokines, such as IL-1 /afii9826 , TNF /afii9825 , GM-CSF, G-CSF, and IFN , recruit PMNs to /afii9828 sites  of  infection  and  each  of  these  molecules can  delay PMN apoptosis [57, 156, 157]. Notably, most of the host-derived cytokines that delay apoptosis also prime neutrophils for enhanced function to a second agonist. Complement component C5 is cleaved to form C5b, a  member of the membrane attack complex, and C5a, a powerful chemotactic agent for neutrophils  [158].  C5a  protects  PMNs  from  apoptosis  and  this  process  involves  BCL2antagonist  of  cell  death  (BAD)  and  phosphoinositol-3  kinase  [159].  Bacterial  products, especially LPS and lipoteichoic acid (LTA), are potent inhibitors of PMN apoptosis [57].

In addition to soluble factors, the extracellular environment can signal PMN apoptosis. For instance, acute hypoxia enhances the in X ammatory response and causes a decrease in PMN apoptosis that has an additive e V ect with GM-CSF [160]. This e V ect is also BCL2independent,  suggesting  that  another  intracellular,  pro-survival  signaling  molecule  is

involved in this process [161]. Hypoxia also increases TLR4 expression and enhances the pro-survival e V ects of LPS toward human PMNs [162].

## Role of toll-like receptors (TLRs) in PMN apoptosis

TLRs in combination with other receptors, e.g., complement receptors, promote rapid and e Y cient  recognition  of  pathogens  by  neutrophils  [163,  164].  To  date,  ten  TLRs  are expressed in human tissues and all but TLR3 are expressed in neutrophils [165]. Ligands for TLRs include lipoproteins (TLR1/TLR2) LTA (TLR6), LPS (TLR4), X agellin (TLR5), double-stranded DNA (TLR3), single-stranded RNA (TLR7), and unmethylated CpG DNA of bacteria and viruses (TLR9) [166]. TLR1, TLR2, TLR4, TLR5, and TLR6 are expressed on the surface of PMNs, whereas TLR79 is localized to intracellular compartments and recruited to the plasma membrane during PMN priming/activation [166-169].

Although all TLRs play an important role in the innate immune response, only TLR2, TLR4, and TLR6 seem to modulate PMN apoptosis directly. Of these TLRs, TLR4 seems to be more tightly coupled to PMN survival than either TLR2 or TLR6. TLR4 binds to LPS and this interaction up-regulates IL-8 mRNA and leads to prolonged neutrophil survival that involves monocytes [170]. This observation can be explained in part by the ability of monocyte CD14 to bind LPS, thereby signaling release of a factor that acts in a synergistic manner  with  TLR4  to  prolong  PMN  survival  [171].  The  monocyte-dependent  delay  in PMN  apoptosis  can  be  reconstituted  by  adding  peripheral  blood  mononuclear  cells (PBMCs) to highly puri W ed PMNs [172]. Sta. aureus peptidoglycan and LTA, agonists for TLR2, also delay PMN apoptosis [173, 174]. In PMN preparations that have been depleted of monocytes by magnetic bead isolation, TLR4 ligation to LPS is the principal TLR survival signal. However, the LPS-mediated delay in apoptosis in the absence of monocytes is relatively short ( » 4 h), as opposed to the 22-h delay observed in the presence of monocytes [43, 175].

## Phagocytosis-induced cell death (PICD)

## Neutrophil apoptosis di V erentiation program

Although a widely accepted view was that mature PMNs have little biosynthetic capacity, recent  evidence  clearly  indicates  that  this  previous  view  is  incorrect.  Human  PMNs express » 12,000-14,000 transcripts and have signi W cant biosynthetic potential. Changes in PMN transcript levels (and associated proteins) during phagocytosis are an important component to the resolution of the in X ammatory response [89, 92, 93, 95, 97, 176-180]. Furthermore, phagocytosis of bacterial pathogens, including Burkholderia cepacia , Borrelia hermsii , Sta.  aureus , Str.  pyogenes ,  and Listeria  monocytogenes, is  followed  by  global changes in neutrophil gene expression concurrent with induction of apoptosis [94]. These W ndings provide an explanation for the increased RNA synthesis in neutrophils following phagocytosis that  was originally  reported  by  Martin  Cline  in  the  1960s  [181].  Bacteriainduced apoptosis or PICD correlates well with alterations in transcripts encoding factors that promote or repress cell death, in X uencing the fate of PMNs [94]. Furthermore, PICD is accompanied by down-regulation of genes encoding proin X ammatory molecules [94, 177]. Based on these W ndings, it was proposed that bacteria induce an apoptosis di V erentiation program in human PMNs that facilitates timely neutrophil turnover during infection. The neutrophil apoptosis di V erentiation program represents the W nal stage of neutrophil matura-

ion and regulates in part multiple processes in human neutrophils, including apoptosis and associated decreased function.

## Bacteria-induced cell death

Phagocytosis-induced cell death (PICD) is a mechanism to clear tissues of spent neutrophils containing dead or partially digested microbes, thereby facilitating the resolution of infection [94, 182-185]. As with spontaneous neutrophil apoptosis, timely removal of neutrophils--although  in  this  case  after  phagocytosis--would  prevent  release  of  cytotoxic molecules into surrounding host tissues, a phenomenon mediated by necrotic lysis [186]. This process is important because neutrophils and neutrophil products are known to contribute to in X ammatory diseases [187-191]. The mechanism of neutrophil PICD remains incompletely de W ned, but progress has been made.

Watson et al. were the W rst to demonstrate that phagocytosis accelerates PMN apoptosis [192]. Since that time, many bacteria have been shown to trigger neutrophil apoptosis or PICD (Table 1). Importantly, the work by Watson et al. linked PMN ROS with apoptosis [192] and ROS play a crucial role in neutrophil apoptosis [3, 47, 60-62, 95, 161, 182, 188, 193-199]. The bacteria: PMN ratio dictates in part  the  level of ROS  produced in vitro, which in turn in X uences cell fate. For example, interaction of E. coli with human PMNs at a 1:1 ratio (1 bacteria per PMN) delays PMN apoptosis, whereas increasing this ratio to

10:1 triggers apoptosis/PICD (see Fig. 2a of ref. [192]). Simons et al. found similar results with Neisseria gonorrhoeae using low (1:1) bacteria: PMN ratios, although the readout was caspase activity rather than ROS production [200]. These results underscore the delicate balance between factors that delay apoptosis (e.g., LPS) and those that trigger PICD (ROS). Inasmuch  as  pathogen-induced  apoptosis  is  complex  process  involving  a  multitude  of signaling molecules and bacterial components, the process is likely dictated by the speci W c microbe and/or number of microbes ingested.

Coxon et al. showed that neutrophils from Cd11b Cd18 / ¡ ¡ / mice have decreased ROS production and delayed apoptosis [195]. Work by Kobayashi et al. used PMNs from 6 X-linked CGD patients to demonstrate that ROS are essential for PICD and a microarray-based approach was used to investigate the role of ROS in PICD [188]. Zhang et al.  reported  that  ROS  production  triggered  by  ligation  of  CD11b/CD18  ultimately activates initiator caspases 3 and 8 in PMNs and that PICD occurs independent of typical death receptors (e.g., FAS/FASL) [60]. Additional links between ROS production and PMN apoptosis were identi W ed in myeloperoxidase-de W cient mice and may involve generation of hypochlorous acid [64, 201]. The importance of ROS in the resolution of infection is exempli W ed by studies in CGD mice, which revealed that neutrophils fail to undergo apoptosis after interaction with pathogens and are thus not removed from the site  of  infection  [202].  Together, these studies revealed that NADPH oxidase-derived ROS are  an  important  intracellular  link  between  the  destruction  of  bacteria  and  the resolution of infection.

Although  most  proin X ammatory  cytokines  and  many  bacteria-derived  factors  delay apoptosis [57, 174, 203-206], a complex signaling system exists such that bacteria-induced apoptosis or PICD overrides any delay in apoptosis due to these factors [207, 208].

## Modulation of neutrophil cell death by bacterial pathogens

While phagocytosis-induced neutrophil apoptosis or PICD is desirable for the resolution of infection  and  prevention  of  excessive  or  chronic  in X ammation,  many  pathogens  have devised means to alter apoptosis and promote pathogenesis [99]. Here, we provide a few examples of this phenomenon and refer the reader to recent reviews on the topic for a more comprehensive overview [99, 209].

Community-associated methicillin-resistant Sta. aureus (CA-MRSA) and Streptococcus pyogenes cause direct PMN lysis and/or accelerate bacteria-induced apoptosis to the point of secondary necrosis [94, 99, 204, 210-213]. The most prominent CA-MRSA strains produce leukotoxins known to cause lysis of human neutrophils, but at sublytic concentrations these toxins induce apoptosis [214]. It has been suggested that lysis of neutrophils by certain Sta. aureus strains promotes severe pathologic states such as necrotizing pneumonia or fatal sepsis, although this hypothesis remains to be tested. Inasmuch as PMNs are the primary cellular defense against staphylococcal infections, depletion of neutrophils seems a likely component of CA-MRSA pathogenesis [212, 215, 216]. However, Sta. aureus leukotoxins such as Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) play little or no unique role in causing cell lysis after phagocytosis [213], a phenomenon that occurs rapidly after uptake of the most prominent CA-MRSA strains [212].

Str. pyogenes is associated with human infections ranging from mild pharyngitis to lifethreatening necrotizing fasciitis [217]. Notably, Str. pyogenes accelerates neutrophil PICD, thereby causing necrosis [211, 217-220]. As with CA-MRSA, Str. pyogenes kills neutrophils to survive within the human host.

## Pathogens that delay neutrophil apoptosis

In contrast to macrophages, few bacteria are known to survive and replicate within neutrophils. A.  phagocytophilum is  an  obligate  intracellular  bacterium  that  delays  neutrophil apoptosis to survive within PMNs [176, 221-225]. Although progress has been made, the mechanism(s) by which A. phagocytophilum delays apoptosis are not well understood. The pathogen  is  ingested  by  caveolae-mediated  endocytosis  and  survives  within  inclusions/ vacuoles that do not contain critical components of the NADPH oxidase [226, 227]. Moreover, A. phagocytophilum actively alters normal neutrophil granule tra Y cking and inhibits NADPH oxidase activation [176, 228, 229]. Notably, the pathogen fails to induce neutrophil  apoptosis  and  dysregulates  neutrophil  gene  expression  to  maximize  survival  and dissemination within the mammalian host [221-223, 230]. By prolonging the lifespan of neutrophils after uptake, A. phagocytophilum survives and disseminates in the host [223].

PMNs readily phagocytose C. pneumoniae and a small fraction of internalized bacteria remain viable for up to 90 h after uptake [224]. C. pneumoniae multiplies within neutrophils and delays constitutive apoptosis such that both phases of the Chlamydia biphasic life cycle occur within PMN inclusions [224, 231]. Delay of neutrophil apoptosis by C. pneumoniae can be as long as 3 days and is associated with decreased caspase-3 activity [224]. Prolonged PMN survival may be mediated by LPS and autocrine production of IL-8 [224]. Intracellular  growth  of Chlamydia is  essential  for  pathogenesis,  because  the  host  cell supplies nutrients and shields the microbe from antimicrobial serum factors.

## Mechanisms of cell death

## Overview

The resolution of infection is complete when bacteria and spent host cells are cleared from tissues.  Although  phagocyte  apoptosis  or  PICD  has  been  reported  after  phagocytosis  of many types of bacteria, the  mechanism  of  cell death  remains  incompletely  de W ned.  For example, it is not always apparent if bacteria cause apoptosis after phagocytosis or if the observed cell death is a more cursory form of host cell lysis. Delineating the mechanism of host cell death is an important W rst step toward the development of better therapeutics for in X ammatory disorders [232].

Initially, cell death was thought to proceed through either apoptosis or necrosis. However,  necrosis is really the end result/equilibrium of cell  death and thus not  a cell death mechanism [233]. Several unique types of cell death are now known to occur depending on speci W c conditions, including the environment and state of the cell (Table 2). These conditions include extracellular factors, e.g., the presence of in X ammatory markers or pH of the extracellular X uid,  and  intracellular  factors  such  as  the  abundance  of  ATP  [234]).  For example, under conditions where ATP is depleted or limiting, cell death proceeds by oncosis, which entails cell swelling and lysis. However, when ATP is abundant, cell death will proceed via the more organized and non-in X ammatory forms of cell death, such as apoptosis or autophagy. Importantly, a cohort of cell death mechanisms has been identi W ed in cell populations in organs under stress [235]. Therefore, the resolution of bacterial infections through host cell death/turnover may encompass multiple mechanisms and not occur solely via apoptosis. As the di V erent mechanisms of cell death receive more attention, the subcellular markers that distinguish these mechanisms have become more de W ned. Each of the

mechanisms can be distinguished from the others based on physical characteristics in combination with biochemical assays (Table 2).

## Apoptosis

Apoptosis, also referred to as type I cell death, is de W ned as a non-in X ammatory form of cell  death  characterized  by  membrane  blebbing,  nuclear  condensation,  and  cytoplasmic condensation.  As  stated  above,  apoptosis  can  be  initiated  by  extracellular  signals  or  by intracellular signals. The end result is an orderly destruction of the infected/damaged cell that does not cause in X ammation in the surrounding tissues.

Typically, apoptosis is detected by DNA degradation, caspase activation, and/or early exposure of PS on the cell surface. Nuclear fragmentation or DNA 'laddering' can be visualized by transmission electron microscopy (condensation and fragmentation of the nucleus) or agarose gel electrophoresis. Caspases are expressed initially as pro-proteins that  undergo  activation  by  proteolytic  cleavage.  As  such,  activated  caspases  can  be detected by Western blot or X ow cytometry analysis (using a X uorophore labeled reagent that binds only to the activated caspase). The traditional marker for neutrophil apoptosis is  nuclear  condensation [19],  as  membrane blebbing does not appear to occur in vitro (Fig. 2).

Although  other  assays  have  been  utilized  to  monitor  apoptosis,  several  reports  have shown that these methods may not be speci W c for apoptotic cells. For example, apoptotic DNA damage has also been monitored by terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase-mediated  dUTP  nick  end  labeling  (TUNEL).  However,  Grasl-Kraupp  et al.  reported  that TUNEL staining does not discriminate between apoptotic and late oncotic cells [236]. The plasma membrane of oncotic cells is extremely porous and TUNEL probably stains DNA via large holes in the cell membrane. During apoptosis the inner lea X et of the plasma membrane containing PS becomes exposed to the extracellular space and the exposed PS can be detected using labeled annexin V. As with TUNEL, recent evidence has shown that late oncotic cells stain positive for annexin V, thereby bringing into question the speci W city of annexin V staining apoptotic cells [237, 238].

## Autophagy-induced cell death

Autophagy, also known as Type II cell death, is a process whereby cells catabolize damaged components so that the essential building blocks, amino acids, lipids, carbohydrates, and etc., can be utilized for cellular repair, especially under times of cellular stress. Cells have the capacity to catabolize damaged proteins as well as entire organelles, including mitochondria. Autophagy was W rst observed in yeast and several genetic markers correlate with the formation of autophagic vacuoles in yeast and mammalian cells.

Autophagy-induced cell death is a programmed cell death that is distinct from apoptosis. Speci W cally, autophagy-induced cell death is induced under conditions of cellular starvation or endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress [239]. Although the mechanism of autophagic cell death is not understood, two genetic markers, beclin 1 and ATG7, are critical for this non-apoptotic death pathway in mammalian cells ([240, 241] and reviewed in [242]). During autophagy-induced cell death, caspases are not activated, although there is cytoplasmic condensation and a reduction in cell size. The most de W ning feature of autophagy-induced cell death is the formation of multilamellar autophagosomes that engulf intracellular components.  These  large  vacuoles  are  easily  distinguished  from  other  subcellular  compartments using transmission electron microscopy. The formation of these large multilamellar

vacuoles may be cell type dependent and more studies need to be done with phagocytes to determine if these vacuoles form in vitro or in vivo. After autophagosome formation, intracellular components are degraded during autophagosome--lysosome fusion [243].

## Pyroptosis

Pyroptosis is a programmed cell death mechanism that results in cell lysis, tissue in X ammation, and recruitment of host professional phagocytes. As with apoptosis, nuclear DNA is cleaved during pyroptosis, although this event is dependent on caspase-1-stimulated nuclease  activity  and  not  poly(ADP-ribose)  polymerase  [244].  Caspase-1  activation  is  a  key event  of  pyroptosis  and  the  enzyme  activates  IL-1 /afii9826 and  IL-18.  These  cytokines  in  turn recruit macrophages and PMNs to the site of infection. Caspase-1 activity also leads to the formation of pores in the eukaryotic cell membrane, allowing an in X ux of extracellular ions that  causes cell swelling and lysis [244]. Shao et al. found that caspase-1 has enzymatic activity  toward  several  proteins  in  the  glycolytic  pathway,  suggesting  a  link  between metabolism/ATP production and pyroptosis [245].

Analogous to the apoptosome complex that mediates apoptosis, pyroptosis is controlled by the formation of a large ( » 700 kDa) multiprotein complex known as the in X ammasome. The in X ammasome is composed of a sensor (NOD-like receptor) [246], an adaptor molecule (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD, ASC, or PYCARD), caspase1, and caspase-5 [247]. Engagement of sensor molecules with ligands such as PAMPs triggers formation of the in X ammasome complex [248]. It is interesting to note that activation of the in X ammasome occurs in the host cell cytosol after bacteria escape from the phagosome. Bacteria that activate the in X ammasome complex include Shigella [249], Francisella tularensis (reviewed  in  [250]), L.  monocytogenes [251], Yersinia [252],  and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium [244, 253, 254].

## Oncosis

Like pyroptosis, oncosis is a form of cell death characterized by cell swelling and lysis. Earlier research had de W ned cell swelling and lysis as necrosis, but necrosis is now widely accepted as the end result of cell death. Necrosis not only includes the lysis of infected cells but also the equilibrium or damage that is caused to surrounding tissues after a cell has lysed [233]. Oncosis, also known as Type III cell death, occurs through multiple mechanisms, but two of the most prominent involve pore forming toxins of pathogenic bacteria and  complement-mediated  lysis.  Pore  forming  toxins  such  as  alpha-hemolysin  of Sta. aureus have the ability to lyse a variety of host cell types, and complement-mediated cell lysis occurs after the formation of the complement membrane attack complex on C3b-targeted cells. As a result, intracellular contents and in X ammatory cytokines are released into the  extracellular  milieu,  causing  tissue  damage  and  in X ammation. Oncosis  occurs  when membrane  integrity  is  damaged  and  an  e Z ux  of  inorganic  ions  (e.g.,  Ca 2+ ,  Na + ,  Cl ¡ ) increases  the  intracellular  and  intraorganelle  osmotic  pressure  [255,  256].  Depletion  of ATP and loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential accompanies this e Z ux of ions into the cell.

Bacteria such as Brucella abortus , Campylobacter jejuni , Pseudomonas aeruginosa , and Salmonella  enterica serovar  Typhimurium  can  cause  host  cell  death  after  phagocytosis [257-260]. These bacteria escape from phagosomes and then alter cell metabolism through the expression of toxins that disrupt membrane integrity, thus causing oncosis. The invasive ability of Cam. jejuni has been associated with the expression of its cytolethal distending

toxin  and  subsequent  ability  to  cause  oncosis  of  epithelial  cells  [258].  Dacheux  et al. showed that P. aeruginosa cystic W brosis isolates induce rapid (within 60 minutes) oncosis of macrophages and PMNs that is type III secretion-dependent [259]. Expression of X agella proteins is required for Sal. enterica -mediated oncosis of and escape from human macrophages [260].

## NETosis

A  novel  form  of  PMN  death  named  NETosis  has  been  described  recently  [261,  262] (Table 2). Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are extrusions of plasma membrane and nuclear  material  composed  of  granule  components  and  histones.  NETs  were  initially reported to occur with viable PMNs [261, 262] and this W nding was con W rmed by others [263]. However, subsequent studies by Fuchs et al. suggest that the process of NET formation involves a type of cell death the authors called NETosis [261, 262]. NETosis occurs in an NADPH oxidase dependent manner [259] and bacteria de W cient in DNAses are susceptible  to  killing  by  NETs  [264].  Although  the  physiological  relevance  in  vivo  has  been debated, as has the issue of whether NETosis is distinct from other types of cell lysis, it is clear  that  in  vitro  NETs  bind  and  kill  extracellular  microorganisms.  Further  research  is needed to better understand these interesting structures.

## Summary of neutrophil death mechanisms

Although there are many fates for phagocytes after interactions with microorganisms, the manner of cell death has serious repercussions that can impact severity and duration of disease.  Pyroptosis  and  oncosis  cause  in X ammation  that  recruits  leukocytes  to  the  site  of infection, but if unchecked, these processes can cause necrosis that leads to the damage of surrounding cell and tissues. In contrast, apoptosis and autophagy are non-in X ammatory forms  of  cell  death  that  recruit  phagocytes  to  the  site  of  infection.  A  comprehensive understanding neutrophil apoptosis, death, and turnover is critical for a full understanding of bacterial pathogenesis mechanisms.

## A paradigm for the resolution of infection

Neutrophil apoptosis is essential for maintaining normal immune system homeostasis and this process facilitates the resolution of in X ammation. PMN apoptosis is mediated by both intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms, and apoptotic cells are subsequently cleared by macrophages through multiple receptor-ligand interactions.

Neutrophil fate is altered by interaction with microorganisms. In most cases, the outcome of this interaction dictates whether the ingested organism will ultimately cause disease. Based upon our current knowledge, there are two possible outcomes for neutrophilbacteria  interactions  (Fig. 5)  [99].  On  one  hand,  phagocytosis  and  killing  of  bacteria culminate with induction of apoptosis/PICD and the subsequent removal by macrophages, ultimately  resulting  in  the  resolution  of  infection  (Fig. 5,  top).  Alternatively,  pathogens such as A. phagocytophilum , C. pneumoniae , Str. pyogenes, and Sta. aureus alter neutrophil apoptosis to survive, and thereby disseminate and cause disease [176, 217, 219, 221, 222, 224] (Fig. 5, bottom). This relatively simple model will need re W ning and revision as we continue to accumulate new information.

## Concluding comment

The use of genomics-based technologies has dramatically enhanced our discovery of mechanisms  of  bacterial  virulence  and  fundamental  immunology.  A  better  understanding  of innate host defense, host cell death, and bacterial pathogenesis will likely provide information important for development of vaccines, treatments, and prophylactic agents designed to prevent and/or control infections.
