## Squeeze to arm

To access infected tissues and perform their duties in host defence, neutrophils must squeeze through the tight junctions between endothelial cells of blood microvessels. A study now shows that the mechanical force experienced by transmigrating neutrophils arms them for better bactericidal activity.

The authors used intravenous staining to distinguish intravascular neutrophils from those that had migrated from lung microvessels into extravascular space in response to inhaled lipopolysaccharide, and showed that transmigrated neutrophils were more efficient at clearing bacteria in vitro. When the restrictiveness of endothelial adherens junctions was increased, by transgenic expression of vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin and VE-protein tyrosine phosphatase, fewer neutrophils could exit the vessels but those that did had enhanced bactericidal function. By contrast, opening of the endothelial junctional barrier, using a VE-cadherinblocking antibody, increased neutrophil migration but reduced their bactericidal activity.

The authors could model the effect of transmigration forces on neutrophil function using a microfluidic system, with either 5 or 200 μm diameter pores. Neutrophils passing through 5 μm pores showed more effective bacterial killing in vitro and when adoptively transferred into mice infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa .

Further experiments highlighted a role for the mechanosensor PIEZO1, a non-selective Ca 2+ channel, in mediating the shift in the phenotype of the migrating neutrophils. Intravital imaging revealed a Ca 2+ influx in neutrophils during the transmigration phase that was abrogated in the absence

of PIEZO1. Moreover, treatment with the PIEZO1 activator Yoda1 increased neutrophil bactericidal function to the same degree as passing through 5 μm pores. Mice with neutrophil-specific Piezo1 deletion had a higher bacterial burden and worse inflammatory lung injury after P. aeruginosa infection.

'mechanical force experienced by transmigrating neutrophils arms them for better bactericidal activity'

Transcriptome analysis revealed a link between PIEZO1-induced Ca 2+ signalling and upregulation of the phago-lysosomal protein NOX4, which mediates bacterial killing through the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). NOX4 was upregulated by neutrophils migrating through 5 μm pores but not through 20 μm pores, and depletion of Nox4 expression reduced the bactericidal activity of neutrophils migrating through the narrow pores. Finally, using mice with Nox4 deletion in neutrophils, the authors confirmed that mechanical forces sensed by PIEZO1 in transmigrating neutrophils arm them for better bactericidal activity by increased ROS generation via NOX4.

The finding that open or injured endothelial junctions allow influx of neutrophils that have poor bactericidal activity may explain their pathogenic role during inflammatory diseases such as acute respiratory distress syndrome. Lucy Bird
