Individuals with diabetes often have chronic inflammation and high levels of inflammatory cytokines, leading to insulin resistance and complications. Anti-inflammatory agents are proposed to prevent these issues, including using  antidiabetic  medications  with  anti-inflammatory  properties  like  semaglutide,  a  GLP-1  analogue.  Semaglutide  not  only  lowers  glucose  but  also  shows  potential  anti-inflammatory  effects.  Studies  suggest  it  can modulate inflammatory responses and benefit those with diabetes. However, the exact mechanisms of its antiinflammatory effects are not fully understood. This review aims to discuss the latest findings on semaglutide s ' anti-inflammatory effects and the potential pathways involved.

## Introduction

The global prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM) is rapidly increasing [1]. This chronic metabolic disorder is characterized by elevated blood glucose levels and is associated with various metabolic complications and harmful pathways affecting lipids and carbohydrates [2]. Within the context  of  diabetes,  several  detrimental  pathways,  such  as  oxidative stress,  inflammation, necrosis, and fibrosis, are activated and exacerbated [2]. Consequently, these pathways can cause damage to cells and tissues, leading to disability or even death [2,3]. As a result, DM is now recognized as a significant risk factor for severe complications, driving the development of herbal and synthetic antidiabetic treatments aimed at managing the disease and alleviating its complications [3 -6]. Despite these efforts, effectively controlling injurious pathways,  such  as inflammation,  in  the  diabetic  environment  remains  a  considerable challenge [7,8].

Semaglutide  is  an  approved  medication  belonging  to  the  class  of incretin-based therapies for individuals with type 2 (T2)DM [9]. It has demonstrated potent antidiabetic effects and effectively lowers blood glucose levels through multiple cellular pathways [9,10]. Recent evidence  suggests  that  semaglutide,  like  other  glucagon-like  peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists [11 -16], may offer additional benefits beyond glycemic control and can suppress certain harmful pathways [17 -19].

However, the precise impact of semaglutide on inflammatory responses, a major pathophysiologic pathway implicated in diabetic complications [8,20],  is  not  yet  fully  understood.  In  this  mechanistic  review,  our objective is to explore the potential benefits of semaglutide in mitigating inflammatory responses.

## Classifications of diabetes mellitus

DM is commonly classified into four main types [21]. T1DM, characterized  by  a  deficiency  of  circulating  insulin  due  to  beta  cell dysfunction  or  failure  [21].  T2DM,  the  most  prevalent  form  of  DM, primarily associated with insulin resistance in peripheral tissues [21]. Gestational diabetes occurs in pregnant women and is believed to be caused by hormonal changes [16]. Additionally, less frequently occurring forms of DM include latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA), maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY), and secondary diabetes resulting from conditions like pancreatitis or certain medications, such as  corticosteroids.  These  specific  forms  collectively  form  the  fourth category of DM [21 -23].

strongly associated with increased incidence of inflammatory reactions [24 26].  These  inflammatory reactions  play  a  significant  role  in  the -development  of  diabetes  mellitus  and  its  associated  complications [27,28]. Elevated glucose levels can activate immune cells and trigger the release of inflammatory cytokines, making chronic hyperglycemia a key driver of inflammation in diabetes [29]. Inflammation is involved in the pathophysiology of insulin resistance and diabetes, disrupting insulin signal transduction [10]. Additionally, mounting experimental and clinical evidence confirms that inflammation is implicated in the pathophysiology of diabetes-induced vascular disorders, including diabetic retinopathy,  diabetic  nephropathy,  diabetic  neuropathy,  and  cardiovascular  disorders  [8,27,28,30].  It  also  contributes  to  other  diabetic complications, such as fatty liver [31]. Moreover, patients with diabetic complications  typically  exhibit  elevated  levels  of  inflammatory  cytokines in their plasma [28,32].

Numerous inflammatory mediators, including tumor necrosis factoralpha (TNFα ), interleukins (IL-1 β , IL-6, IL-18), matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), chemokine ligand 2 (CCL-2), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), nuclear factor kappa B (Nfκ B), transforming growth factor-beta (TGFβ ),  E-selectin, various adhesion molecules (ICAM-1, VCAM-1), toll-like receptors (TLRs), adiponectin, endothelial  cell-selective  adhesion  molecule  (ESAM),  and  interferongamma (INF- ),  are  strongly  implicated  in  diverse  forms  of  diabetic γ complications [33 -35]. Furthermore, these potent biological elements are highly expressed and secreted in the diabetic context, supporting the ' inflammation theory ' that emphasizes the pivotal roles of inflammatory  responses  in  the  pathophysiology  of  diabetes  mellitus  and  its associated complications [28,36]. Therefore, understanding and addressing the inflammatory component of diabetes is crucial for the development of effective therapeutic strategies aimed at preventing or mitigating complications associated with this disease.

## GLP-1 receptor agonists and semaglutide

Incretin-based medications are a class of drugs commonly used in the management  of  T2DM  (Table  1)  [37].  These  medications  target  the incretin system, which plays a crucial role in regulating blood sugar levels [37,38]. Incretins are hormones released by the enteroendocrine L-cells of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract in response to food intake [38]. They stimulate the release of insulin from the pancreas and reduce the production  of  glucagon,  helping  to  normalize  postprandial  glucose levels [38,39]. Incretin-based medications mimic the actions of natural incretins,  such  as  GLP-1  and  gastric  inhibitory  hormone  (GIP).  They increase insulin secretion from the pancreas, decrease glucose production by the liver, slow down stomach emptying, and suppress appetite [10]. There is also evidence suggesting that GLP-1 up-regulates insulin

## expression [40] (Fig. 1).

GLP-1,  a 30-amino  acid  peptide,  is produced  from  the  preproglucagon  within  enteroendocrine  L-cells  located  in  the  GI  tract [41]. GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) are a category of antidiabetic medications designed to induce hypoglycemic effects by replicating the actions of incretin hormones, particularly through the activation of GLP1 receptors [41,42]. These medications act on the GLP-1 receptor, a type of  G-protein  coupled  receptor  primarily  found  on  the  surfaces  of pancreatic beta cells [42]. Activation of the GLP-1 receptor leads to the generation  of  cyclic  adenosine  monophosphate  (cAMP),  subsequent cellular depolarization, and insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells in response to feeding [42 -44].

Semaglutide is a specific type of incretin-based medication known as a GLP-1 analogue. It binds to its specific receptors on pancreatic beta cells,  enhancing  insulin  secretion  in  response  to  postprandial  hyperglycemia (Fig. 1) [42,55]. It also inhibits glucagon release, which helps reduce  excessive  glucose  production  by  the  liver  [55].  Additionally, semaglutide can promote a feeling of fullness, reduce food cravings, and lead to a reduction in food intake and, consequently, weight loss in some individuals [55,56]. There is also evidence suggesting that semaglutide induces the expression of Glut-4 [57]. Semaglutide is often administered as  an  injectable  medication,  but  it  is  also  available  in  an  oral  form, making it the only oral GLP-1 analogue currently available [9,58]. Three forms of semaglutide, namely Ozempic, Rybelsus, and Wegovy, have been approved by the FDA [59,60]. Like all synthetic drugs, semaglutide may induce some adverse effects, such as nausea and diarrhea [61].

## Semaglutide and inflammation

While semaglutide is primarily known for its metabolic benefits, such as  regulating  glucose  levels,  promoting  weight  loss,  and  normalizing lipid  profiles,  there  is  emerging evidence suggesting that it may also have  additional  anti-inflammatory  effects  [20,62].  In  fact,  there  is strong  evidence  indicating  that  semaglutide  can  modulate  or  reduce inflammatory processes [63 -65]. Considering that inflammation is a key factor in many diabetic complications, these anti-inflammatory effects of  semaglutide  could  provide  additional  benefits,  particularly  in  the cardiovascular system [66]. Therefore, semaglutide may have protective roles  in  addition  to  its  metabolic  benefits,  potentially  benefiting  the cardiovascular system [66,67], liver tissue [68], and kidneys [69].

Although  there  is  still  limited  evidence  exploring  the  specific mechanisms involved, current knowledge suggests two major pathways by which semaglutide exerts its anti-inflammatory effects: reducing inflammatory cytokine levels and modifying immune system activity. It is important  to  note  that  these  pathways  may  overlap  and  be  interconnected in many cases. In the following sections, we will present the

latest findings regarding the anti-inflammatory roles of semaglutide and discuss the possible mechanisms involved, drawing from both clinical trials and experimental studies.See (Table 2).

## Reducing the inflammatory cytokines

Semaglutide, a GLP-1 receptor agonist, has been shown to have antiinflammatory  effects  by  suppressing  the  release  of  pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6 and TNFα [63,70]. In an animal model of seizures using pentylenetetrazole, semaglutide demonstrated neuroprotective  effects  and  improved  cognitive  function  by  inhibiting  the release of inflammatory cytokines mediated by the NLRP3 inflammasome, a complex involved in regulating the innate immune system and inflammatory responses. This effect was observed in mice [70].

In another animal seizure model, semaglutide reduced inflammation signaling  pathways,  including  p38  MAPK,  c-Jun-Nfκ B  p65,  in  brain tissues  of  rats  [71].  These  neuroprotective  effects  were  also  demonstrated in another experiment [72]. In a study using male Swiss albino mice, semaglutide reduced levels of TNFα , IL-6, and IL-1 β in brain tissues during endotoxemia and polymicrobial sepsis, leading to improved cognitive abilities [72]. Additionally, semaglutide reduced lung injury in a rat model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute lung injury by suppressing TNFα , IL-6, and Nfκ B activities [73].

Clinical  evidence  also  supports  the  anti-inflammatory  effects  of semaglutide. In a study involving 40 men with T2DM, treatment with 1 mg of semaglutide per week for 6 months reduced circulating levels of inflammatory cytokines TNFα and IL-6 [63]. This effect may contribute to a reduction in systemic inflammation and potentially lower the risk of cardiovascular  disorders  [63].  A  more  recent  clinical  study  reported anti-inflammatory effects of semaglutide (1 mg/week) in patients with T2DM, although these effects were not significant after 3 months [64]. Furthermore, a meta -analysis examining the effects of semaglutide on the  inflammatory  cytokine  high-sensitive  C-reactive  protein  (hsCRP) found a significant reduction in its levels in patients with T2DM [74].

In a recent clinical study, semaglutide improved renal function in patients with T2DM by reducing inflammatory responses [65]. It has also been suggested that semaglutide may have greater antiinflammatory potential in suppressing the inflammatory storms induced  by  COVID-19  compared  to  other  GLP-1  mimetics  [75,76]. Overall, the available evidence suggests that semaglutide has the ability to attenuate or block the release of inflammatory cytokines in various tissues [77] (Tables 3 and 4).

## Modulation of immune system response

Semaglutide  has  the  ability  to  modulate  immune  system  activity through  various  pathways  [62,66,81].  GLP-1  receptors  are  found  on

different  immune cells, such as neutrophils and eosinophils [82 -85], and their activation has modulatory effects on immune responses and inflammatory processes [83,84]. Evidence suggests that semaglutide can activate these receptors and modulate immune system activity [83,86]. McLean et al. demonstrated that semaglutide activates GLP-1 receptors on endothelial and hematopoietic cells in mice [86]. They observed a subsequent reduction in inflammatory cytokines such as TNFα , Abcg1, TGF- 1, Cd3g, and CCL-2 in hepatocytes [86]. Emerging evidence has β also suggested similar benefits in epicardial fat [67].

A recent study reported that  semaglutide decreases inflammatory processes in epicardial fat of patients undergoing open-heart surgery [67]. This study demonstrated that semaglutide reduces the activity of neutrophils and their adhesion to endothelial cells in human epicardial fat,  which expresses GLP-1 receptors [67]. Another recent study provided further evidence suggesting that semaglutide suppresses neutrophil  activation  in  epicardial  fat  collected  from  patients  undergoing cardiac surgery [87]. Since the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio is associated with cardiovascular risk [88], these anti-inflammatory effects of semaglutide may translate into additional cardiac benefits [66,67,87].

Furthermore,  semaglutide  modulates  immune  system  activity  by decreasing the recruitment or activity of immune cells [66,68]. Rakipovski et al. demonstrated that semaglutide reduces leukocyte recruitment and rolling and decreases atherogenic plaque formation in mice [66]. Hansen et al. reported that semaglutide suppresses the recruitment of cytotoxic T-cells (CD8 + ) into hepatocytes in an animal model of nonalcoholic  steatohepatitis  (NASH)  [54].  Other  suggested  mediating pathways  by  which  semaglutide  modifies  immune  system  activity include reducing the proliferation of inflammatory cells [62], lowering the uptake of activated macrophages in blood vessels (resulting in fewer vascular injuries) [79], and reducing the development of atherosclerotic plaque lesions [66]. In summary, semaglutide can modify immune system function through various molecular mechanisms.

## Indirect pathways

Inflammatory processes can be activated in response to other pathways, such as oxidative stress [90]. Additionally, they are associated with pathological conditions such as obesity, which is characterized by underlying chronic inflammation [62]. There is evidence suggesting that semaglutide indirectly exerts anti-inflammatory effects by suppressing these mediating mechanisms [19,62,80]. It has been shown to reduce oxidative stress-dependent inflammation in H9c2 cells treated with LPS through an AMPK-dependent pathway, leading to decreased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lower levels of NFκ B, TNFα , and IL-1 β [19].  Furthermore,  semaglutide  has  been  found  to  ameliorate obesity-induced inflammation by down-regulating S100a8, S100a9, and Cxcl2 in neutrophils of obese mice [62,80]. It has also demonstrated a reduction in obesity-dependent inflammation in obese mice [91]. These effects may represent additional molecular links between semaglutide and the reduction of inflammation.

## Cardiovascular benefits of anti-inflammatory effects of semaglutide

The anti-inflammatory effects of semaglutide have been shown to provide cardiovascular benefits in several experiments [62]. Semaglutide has been found to protect endothelial progenitor cells by inhibiting the expression of miR-155 (a microRNA) in macrophage exosomes [62]. MiR-155 induces inflammation in macrophage exosomes and impairs the function of endothelial progenitor cells, so its inhibition is associated with  improved  endothelial  function  [62].  Semaglutide  has  also  been shown to improve the function of aortic endothelial cells and induce the angiogenesis process in the myocardium [67]. In various experiments, semaglutide  has  reduced  myocardial  injury  and  improved  cardiac function by suppressing inflammatory responses [19,62,80]. These antiinflammatory effects have resulted in pro-thrombotic, anti-

atherosclerotic, and anti-atherogenic benefits in animal [66,79,86] and human  [67,80] studies. Furthermore, semaglutide may  improve vascular structure and preserve endothelial permeability by normalizing the elements involved in the extracellular matrix and cytoskeleton, such as Coll5a1, Lama4, and Sparc [91,92]. Therefore, it appears that semaglutide may protect the cardiovascular system, improve cardiac function, and promote ventricular thickening through its anti-inflammatory effects (Fig. 2) [79,80,93].

## Conclusion

Inflammation plays a significant role in the pathophysiology of diabetes  and  its  associated  complications,  and  controlling  inflammation could be a major target for attenuating or preventing these disorders. Semaglutide,  a  long-acting  GLP-1  analogue,  has  potent  antidiabetic properties  and normalizes glucose homeostasis through several pathways. Recent evidence suggests additional anti-inflammatory effects of semaglutide.  While  there  is  still  limited  available  evidence,  current knowledge suggests that semaglutide is able to reduce circulating inflammatory cytokines and modulate immune system responses. Further studies are needed to fully understand all the pathways involved, but current evidence strongly suggests cardiovascular and hepatic benefits for semaglutide based on its potent anti-inflammatory effects.
