## Abstract

Neutrophils are immune cells involved in several inflammatory and homeostatic processes. Their capacity to release cargo can be classified based on whether the cargo is released on its own, or in conjunction with plasma membrane structures. Examples of plasma membrane-  free secretion modes are degranulation, neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) release, and cytokine release through inflammasome formation. The most studied  membrane-  covered  neutrophil-  derived  structures  are  exosomes  and  ectosomes that are collectively called extracellular vesicles (EV). Apoptotic vesicles are another recognized EV subtype. Over the last decade, additional membrane-  covered neutrophil-  derived structures were characterized: migratory cytoplasts, migrasomes, and elongated neutrophil-  derived structures (ENDS). All these structures are smaller than the neutrophils, cannot reproduce themselves, and thus meet the latest consensus definition of EVs. In this review, we focus on the less well-  studied neutrophil EVs: apoptotic vesicles, cytoplasts, migrasomes, and ENDS.

## 1   INTRODUCTION |

Neutrophils  are  the  most  abundant  immune  cells  in  human  blood and  play  an  important  role  in  host  defense  against  bacterial  and fungal infections. These cells are also involved in tissue remodeling and pathological conditions like sepsis, autoimmune diseases, allergies,  chronic  obstructive  pulmonary  diseases,  atherosclerosis,  and cancer. 1-  3

Neutrophils are professional phagocytes that are highly effective in killing pathogens and cleaning up tissue debris. Neutrophils also  release  a  vast  array  of  inflammatory  and  antimicrobial  molecules. Many of these molecules are stored in granules within the neutrophils and are released when the granules fuse with the plasma

membrane. This exocytotic process is also called degranulation. 1,4 Degranulation  already  begins  when  circulating  neutrophils  get primed. This is suggested by the presence of CD66a-  positive neutrophils and MPO in the circulation,  both of which are intracellu5 lar  molecules. Degranulation reaches its peak in the extravascular space where the fully activated neutrophils release their most toxic molecules like the serine proteases neutrophil elastase and cathepsin  G.   Neutrophils  also  release  several  molecules  in  conjunction 1 with nuclear or mitochondrial DNA. This process is called neutrophil  extracellular  trap  (NET)  release.  NET  release  can  happen  on the endothelial surface and in the extravascular space. 6,7 NETs may be released by neutrophil plasma membrane lysis that is accompanied by the death of the neutrophil or by fusion of NET-  containing

intracellular  vesicles  with  the  neutrophil  plasma  membrane  that leaves the neutrophil alive. 8 NETs are devoid of plasma membrane.

Neutrophils have several mechanisms to release molecules enclosed  by  phospholipid  bilayer  structures.  These  structures  are smaller  than  the  neutrophils,  do  not  contain  a  functional  nucleus, and cannot replicate. These properties define them as extracellular vesicles (EV) according to the International Society of Extracellular Vesicles  (ISEV).   EVs  are  categorized  into  subsets  based  on  their 9 mechanism of formation and size. The best-  studied subsets are exosomes and ectosomes. This review focuses on the understudied or recently discovered subsets: apoptotic EVs, cytoplasts, migrasomes, and elongated neutrophil-  derived structures (ENDS).

## 2   EXOSOMES AND ECTOSOMES |

Exosomes form intracellularly inside endosomes that become multivesicular  bodies.  The  multivesicular  bodies  fuse  with  the  plasma membrane, resulting in exosome release into the extracellular space. On the contrary, ectosomes (or microvesicles) bud off directly from the cell membrane into the extravascular space. 10,11 The molecular mechanisms behind these processes were thoroughly reviewed. 10,11 The diameter of exosomes is limited by the size of endosomes and varies between 50 and 150 nm, which is below but overlapping with the size range of ectosomes that range from 100 nm to 1 Î¼ m in diameter (Figure 1 and Table 1). Currently, this size difference is used to estimate the ratio of exosome and ectosome release. 12 Based on such estimates, the majority of EVs released by neutrophils are ectosomes. 13 However, the characterization of release, composition, and effect of exosomes and ectosomes remains a major challenge due to the difficulty of identifying reliable markers for differentiation of exosomes and ectosomes. 9,14

Recently  Kolonics  and  colleagues  thoroughly  reviewed  the  literature of exo/ectosome release by neutrophils. 13 Since 1998, over 55 studies were published where neutrophil-  derived exo/ectosomes

with or without isolation by density centrifugation, dialysis, filtration, or  precipitation  were  analyzed  by  electron  microscopy,  nanoparticle  tracking  analysis,  dynamic  light  scattering,  tunable  resistive pulse sensing, ultrasensitive flow cytometry, or imaging cytometry (ImageStream - Amnis 15,16 ). Some of the older studies preceded the publication of the latest ISEV consensus guidelines.  Thus, results 9 from older studies must be viewed with caution. Also, ultracentrifugation aggregates exosomes and ectosomes, and freezing followed by thawing compromises their membrane integrity. 17,18

Due  to  technical  difficulties,  very  few  studies  reported  exact exosome  or  ectosome  counts  for  body  fluids.  Imaging  cytometry appears to be the ideal tool for quantitative analysis of such counts, because  this  technique  requires  minimal  sample  preparation,  has high  throughput  and  sensitivity,  and  enables  neutrophil-  derived exo/ectosome  identification  through  neutrophil-  specific  surface markers like Ly6G in mice and CD66b in humans. 19,20 During imaging cytometry, a multi-  channel fluorescent image is captured of each particle  that  passes  by  the  detector.  The  resulting  dataset  is  analyzed with image masking-  based analysis tools that allow to quantify the fluorescent signal and shape of the captured exo/ectosome. Imaging cytometry can exclude crowding events, defined as multiple objects captured in the detection area at the same time. Flow cytometry can be also used to enumerate exo/ectosome populations in  suspensions; however, this requires a dedicated high-  sensitivity flow cytometer, 21 the analysis does not provide information about the shape of the exo/ectosome and it is vulnerable to the above described crowding events. The advantages and disadvantages of the most frequently used exo/ectosome analysis methods are shown in Table 1 and discussed in more detail in recent publications. 22-  25

Neutrophils release exo/ectosomes even without stimulation, which can be detected in supernatant of cultured neutrophils and also in healthy human blood. With imaging cytometry, Headland and colleagues counted about 100 neutrophil-  derived exo/ectosomes  per  microliter  of  healthy  human  platelet-  poor  plasma. 15 With the same technique but slightly different sample preparation

protocol  that  included  lower  centrifugation  forces,  our  group counted  about  1000  neutrophil-  derived  exo/ectosomes  per  microliter of healthy human plasma. 16 In  vitro experiments showed that neutrophils increase their exo/ectosome release upon numerous types of stimulation including inflammatory mediators (TNF, IFN-  , GM-  CSF, C5a, PAF, IL-  8), bacteria and bacterial molecules Î³ ( S. aureus, M. tuberculosis, Meningococcus , fMLP, LPS); this was recently reviewed. 13,26 Increased blood exo/ectosome counts were measured in numerous infectious, autoimmune and traumatic disease states; however, most of the applied detection methods do not  give  absolute  counts.  For  those  that  do,  the  results  cannot be  compared directly  due  to  the  different  exo/ectosome  detection  methods  used. 13,26,27 With  imaging  cytometry,  we  counted 120,000 exo/ectosomes / Î¼ l of septic patients' blood, more than 100 times the number in healthy donors' blood. 16 Besides blood plasma,  neutrophil-  derived  exo/ectosomes  have  also  been  detected in the bronchoalveolar and peritoneal lavage of septic patients 28 and in the bronchoalveolar lavage of chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD) patients. 29

The effect of exo/ectosome release on the neutrophil itself is unknown. However, the effect of the neutrophil-  derived exo/ectosomes on other cells was extensively studied. While exo/ectosomes do  not  contain  organelles,  they  carry  various  molecules  including adhesion molecules (integrins, selectins), Fc and complement receptors, neutrophil granule-  associated molecules (e.g., MPO, elastase, and CD63), neutrophil cytosolic proteins (S100A8), and micro RNAs through  which  exo/ectosomes  can  influence  other  cells,  bacteria, blood coagulation, or the extracellular matrix. 13,26 Numerous in vitro co-  incubation experiments showed that neutrophil-  derived exo/ectosomes can exert pro- or anti-  inflammatory effects on various immune cells including monocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils. 13,30 Neutrophil-  derived exo/ectosomes were found to inhibit bacterial growth by aggregating bacteria, 31 to activate platelets by delivering arachidonic  acid, 32 to  mediate  neutrophil  swarming  by  prolonging the lifetime of leukotriene B4 (LTB4) released by neutrophils, 33 and

to  contribute  to  COPD  development by protecting the neutrophil elastase  from Î± 1-  antitrypsin  in  the  lungs. 29 Recently,  neutrophilderived  exo/ectosomes  were  shown  to  contribute  to  vascular  inflammation at atherosclerosis-  prone vessel sites with disturbed flow by delivering miR-  155 into endothelial cells. 34 Neutrophil exo/ectosomes also contribute to epithelial injury in inflammatory bowel diseases by delivering miR-  26a and miR-  155 into the epithelial cells. 35

## 3   APOPTOTIC EXTRACELLULAR | VESICLES

Apoptosis is a programmed cell death that results in regulated cell removal by efferocytosis. 36 During apoptosis, several cell types are known to release apoptotic EVs which can be stratified by their size as  small  (diameter  50-  1000 nm)  and  large  (diameter  1-  5 Î¼ m),  the latter also called apoptotic bodies (Figure 1 and Table 1). 37,38 While small apoptotic EVs may form similarly as exo/ectosomes, 39 apoptotic bodies are released in a different way. Caspase-  3 mediated activation  of  Rho-  associated  kinase  1  and  other  kinases  orchestrate cell  contraction  that  results  in  membrane  blebbing  due  to  the  increased intracellular pressure. 38 Sometimes, the blebs separate from the cell and become apoptotic bodies with up to 5 Î¼ m diameter. 40 More  often,  under  the  regulation  of  the  plasma  membrane  ATP channel pannexin-  1 and transmembrane protein plexin-  b2, filaments (apoptopodia) grow out from the apoptotic cell. Sometimes, these structures turn into beaded apoptopodia as 10-  20 beads form along their length. Eventually, apoptopodia detach from the cell forming 1-  4 Î¼ m large apoptotic bodies. 38,41,42

Apoptotic EVs often express the surface markers of the source cell, like CD3 for T cells, CD11b for myeloid cells, CD31 for endothelial cells, and CD45 for leukocytes. 43 While apoptotic bodies can be distinguished from cells by flow cytometry due to their smaller size and lower granularity, 40,44,45 separation of apoptotic EVs from exo/ ectosomes is challenging.

Apoptotic EVs carry the apoptotic marker phosphatidylserine (PS, detected with Annexin-  5) 40,44 ;  however, the specificity of PS for  apoptotic  EVs  is  questionable 46 because  several  groups  have reported PS enrichment on exo/ectosomes too. 47 As soon as 20 min after  incubation,  isolated  human  neutrophils  release  PS-  positive exo/ectosomes smaller than 1 Î¼ m, 31 but these neutrophils are most likely  not  apoptotic  yet.  While  apoptotic  EVs  form  from  cell  surfaces that already expose PS, on non-  apoptotic exo/ectosomes PS exposure is suggested to happen due to absence of flippases from the exo/ectosomes. 48 Poon and colleagues introduced TO-  PRO-  3 Iodide staining as a criterion to identify apoptotic bodies by flow cytometry. 40 Uptake  of  TO-  PRO-  3  dye  is  indicative  of  the  presence of the pannexin-  1  ATP  channel  in  the  plasma  membrane  of the apoptotic body and, once internal, TO-  PRO-  3 binds to doublestranded  DNA.  However,  some  apoptotic  bodies  do  not  contain DNA and thus cannot be distinguished from exo/ectosomes using this method. 46

The literature of neutrophil-  derived apoptotic vesicles is scarce. Shi  and  colleagues  showed  by  electron  microscopy  that  apoptotic neutrophils and their apoptotic bodies are phagocytosed by Kupffer  cells  in  rat  liver  sinusoids. 49 In  another  study,  Dalli  and colleagues  collected  neutrophil-  derived  EVs  from  human  neutrophils  after  1  day  of  culture 50 and  found  that &gt; 85% of  EVs  were Annexin-  5  positive.  Although  the  authors  did  not  aim  to  study apoptotic  vesicles,  their  sample  most  likely  contained  apoptotic vesicles, because neutrophils turn apoptotic after 5 h in culture. 51 Dieker and colleagues studied EVs in the blood of systemic lupus erythematosus  patients  and  found  that  15%  of  the  Annexin-  5 + and  apoptosis-  modified  histone-  positive  EVs  were  of  neutrophil origin  (CD31 + CD45 CD66b ),  suggesting  the  release  in  vivo  of + + neutrophil-  derived apoptotic EVs. 52

Neutrophil apoptosis happens at steady state and has an important  role  in  negatively  regulating  neutrophil  production.  In  healthy humans, about 1 billion neutrophils are made per kg body weight a day. Within a few hours of production, most of the neutrophils in bone marrow, liver, and spleen become apoptotic and are phagocytosed by macrophages and dendritic cells. 53 This tempers IL-  23 release by macrophages and dendritic cells, which in turn reduces the production of IL-  17A by Î³Î´ T cells and other T-  cell populations leading to reduced GCSF levels and reduced neutrophil production. 54

Since neutrophil apoptosis happens at steady state, neutrophilderived apoptotic EVs must form very commonly as well. However, this probably happens mainly in the bone marrow, spleen, liver, and lungs. 53 Due to the increase of eat-  me signals (e.g., PS) and decrease of do not eat me signals (e.g., CD47), neutrophil-  derived apoptotic EVs are probably rapidly cleared by local phagocytes.

Apoptopodia formation was documented in monocytes 41 ; however, it is not known whether apoptopodia form in neutrophils, too. Some reports suggest that it might happen. The apoptosis-  inducing compound  staurosporine  was  found  to  induce  long  filament  outgrowth  from  various  cells. 55,56 This  was  observed  in  neutrophils as  well,  and  fragments  of  these  filaments  broke  off  from  the neutrophils. 57

## 4   CYTOPLASTS |

In  1967,  Carter  noticed  that  the  nuclei  of  adhered  fibroblasts  are extruded after prolonged cytochalasin B treatment. 58 The extruded nuclei connected to the cell through an easily severable thin plasma membrane tether which sometimes broke spontaneously. Based on this  phenomenon, Wigler and Weinstein combined cytochalasin B treatment with Ficoll density centrifugation to establish a scalable method for preparation of nucleus-  free cells. 59 In  1983,  Roos  and colleagues applied this technique to human neutrophils to generate vesicles without nuclei and granules, called neutrophil cytoplasts. 60 Another  method  for  neutrophil  fragment  production  was  discovered by Keller and Bessis; heating adhered neutrophils to 46Â°C induced the formation of blebs, which separated from the cell body as the neutrophils migrated away. 61,62 These structures were named cytokineplasts. 62

During the next two decades, several groups employed in vitromade cytoplasts and cytokineplasts to study neutrophil functions. These nucleus- and granule-  free neutrophil bodies were about half of the neutrophil's size, had an intact plasma membrane, 60 were able to migrate, 63 react to fMLP, 64,65 form LTB 4, 66 and were capable of phagocytosis  and  bacterial  killing. 60,67,68 Unlike  neutrophils,  cytoplasts and cytokineplasts were able to maintain their migratory and antibacterial  functions  even  after  thawing  from  cryopreservation, which raised hope that cytoplasts or cytokineplasts could become a therapeutic option. 67

In  2004,  Brinkman and colleagues discovered that neutrophils exposed  to  inflammatory  mediators  such  as  PMA,  IL-  8,  or  LPS  in vitro can release their nuclear DNA and form NETs. 69 Almost a decade later, Yipp and colleagues found that injection of S. pyogenes Gram-  positive bacteria into the mouse skin induces NET release in vivo. The remaining neutrophils with diffuse nuclei resembled the in vitro-  made cytoplasts in their shape and migration. 70 The  authors detected anuclear neutrophils in the fluid of S.pyogenes abscesses of patients, and they also observed anuclear neutrophil formation by  human neutrophils injected  into  the  mouse  skin  together  with S.aureus . These findings showed for the first time that anuclear neutrophil (or cytoplast) formation can happen in vivo and is associated with NET release.

Subsequently, in vivo NET release was observed on the surface of  large  veins  during  deep  vein  thrombosis, 71 in  atherosclerotic plaque, 72,73 during infection in the lungs, 74 in the liver and the gastrointestinal system. 75 Likely all these NET-  forming events resulted in the formation of cytoplasts; however, in these studies, presence of cytoplasts was not investigated.

In mice stimulated with house dust mite extract and LPS, neutrophils undergo NET release and cytoplasts become detectable in the bronchoalveolar fluid and in the mediastinal lymph nodes. 76 Peptidyl arginine deaminase 4 (PAD4) is one of the NET release regulators. In PAD4 knockout mice, LPS did not induce NET release and cytoplasm formation. The authors isolated cytoplasts from the lungs of these mice  by  FACS  as  CD45 + CD11b Ly6G DNA-  objects.  They  found + + that cytoplasts excluded trypan blue, showed chemokinesis (but no

chemotaxis toward LTB4), phagocytosed and acidified E. coli particles, and killed S.pneumoniae . Cytoplasts also trigger dendritic cells, resulting in increased antigen-  specific IL-  17 and IL-  13 production by CD4  T cells. The authors also detected CD45 + + CD66b CD16 DNA-+ + cytoplasts in the BALF of severe asthmatic patients.

By appearance, cytoplasts resemble apoptotic bodies: both have diameters between 3 and 5 Î¼ m, little or no DNA content, and are decorated with neutrophil surface markers (Figure 1 and Table 1). So far, no study compared the two entities directly; however, based on published data, cytoplasts should be distinguishable from apoptotic bodies by lack of PS on their surface 76 and by their higher side scatter signal in flow cytometry caused by their higher intracellular granularity.

## 5   MIGRASOMES |

Migrating neutrophils form long and thin traction fibers from their uropod, which may detach from the neutrophil and form a trail of membrane-  covered  structures  along  the  migrated  path.  This  was first  shown  by  Hyun  and  colleagues,  who  found  that  neutrophils extravasating from mesenteric venules in mice leave behind about 1 Î¼ m  large  spherical  structures  in  the  perivascular  area. 77 These structures are positive for Î² 2 integrins, and their formation depends on  the  LFA-  1  ( Î± L Î² 2)-  mediated  arrest  and  VLA-  3  ( Î± 3 1)-  mediated Î² transmigration of the neutrophils. The authors confirmed these findings in human neutrophils, which leave behind membrane-  covered structures during transmigration across cultured human endothelial cells. 77

Later, Lim and colleagues reported that in neutrophil-  depleted mice, fewer T cells migrate to the flu-  infected trachea than in control mice 78 and hypothesized that migrating neutrophils leave behind trails that guide T cells to the inflamed tissue. The authors supported their  hypothesis with in vitro experiments showing that migrating neutrophils leave behind membrane-  covered structures that release CXCL12. Additionally, in in vitro chemotaxis assays, T cells migrated toward the zone where neutrophils had migrated earlier and in vivo, in  the  ear  of  mice,  T  cells  migrated along the path demarcated by neutrophil-  derived  spherical  membrane-  covered  structures.  Both phenomena  were  attenuated  by  pharmacological  inhibition  of CXCR4, the receptor for CXCL12, suggesting that the trails released by migrating neutrophils guide T-  cell migration through CXCL12 recognition. Trail formation by migrating neutrophils was also observed in the lungs 79 and liver 80,81 of  mice; however, whether these trails guide other cells is not known.

In the same year, Ma and colleagues reported the discovery of migrasomes, which are 2-  3 Î¼ m spherical vesicles that form at the tips and branching points of traction fibers that extend from the uropod of migrating cells 82 and thus might be the same type of structures discussed above. Migrasomes are enriched for tetraspanin-  4 and  may  contain  up  to  300  smaller  vesicles  inside  each  of  them. Migrasomes were detected in intestinal capillaries and lung alveoli of mice and rats. A detailed protocol for migrasome detection was

recently published. 83 Activated Î± 5 1 integrin was found to be enÎ² riched in the basal surface of retraction fibers and migrasomes of MGC803 cells, suggesting that integrins are necessary for the formation of these structures. 84 Huang and colleagues identified tetraspanin-  4 and cholesterol as key drivers of migrasome formation from a normal rat epithelial kidney cell line; both form clusters and increase the membrane stiffness that forces sphere formation from membrane tubules. 85 Proteomic  analysis  revealed  that  relative  to the cell bodies migrasomes are enriched in migration- and adhesionrelated proteins and have a different composition that exosomes, as their proteomes overlap only by 27%. 86

The above-  discussed studies suggest that migrasome formation depends on integrin-  mediated anchorage and tetraspanin-  mediated membrane sphere formation. The proposed requirement for integrin anchorage fits well with trail and migrasome formation on the vessel wall, where neutrophil migration is integrin-  dependent. 87 In the extravascular space, even though swarming neutrophils do not require high-  affinity  integrin  interaction  for  interstitial  migration  (only  for compaction at the center of the injury 88 ), migrasome formation was observed. 78

Jiao  and  colleagues  reported  migrasome  formation  by  mouse neutrophils  in  vivo  and  discovered  that  these  migrasomes  can contain mitochondria with impaired membrane potential, suggesting  that  migrasome  release  can  serve  as  removal  mechanism  for damaged  mitochondria. 81 The  authors  designated  mitochondriacontaining  migrasomes  as  mitosomes,  and  their  formation  process as mitocytosis (Figure 1 and Table 1). Jiao and colleagues also found that neutrophils from tetraspanin-  9 knockout mice produce fewer mitosomes and have more splenic neutrophils with impaired mitochondrial  membrane  potential.  These  findings  suggest  that mitocytosis is important for neutrophil health; however, its role in neutrophil aging and host defense requires further investigation.

## 6   ELONGATED NEUTROPHIL-  DERIVED | STRUCTURES (ENDS)

Cryo-  EM investigation of EVs released by a human mast cell line in vitro showed that cells can produce EVs of different shapes, 89 suggesting that EV shape should be considered during EV classification. Focusing on blood, Yuana and colleagues detected elongated particles in plasma of healthy human donors by cryo-  EM. 90 In their study, surface markers were not assessed; thus, the elongated particles' cell of origin remained undefined. The subcellular structures were pelleted and resuspended for imaging, which might have caused artificial formation of elongated particles as indicated by a recent study. 91 Arraud  and  colleagues  reported  elongated  particles  in  healthy human donors' plasma as well. 92 The authors performed cryo-  EM by freezing platelet-  free plasma onto a perforated carbon film without pelleting and resuspension. About half of the observed subcellular objects had an elongated shape with an average length of 2.2 Î¼ m and maximal length over 6 Î¼ m and width between 50 and 400 nm. Most of the elongated particles did not present PS on their surface as

indicated by lack of labeling with gold-  conjugated Annexin-  5. About 70% of the elongated particles were either CD235 or CD41 positive, indicating erythrocyte or platelet origin, respectively. Some of the remaining 30% may have been of leukocyte origin, but the samples were  not  stained  for  leukocyte  markers.  Tersteeg  and  colleagues confirmed the existence  of  platelet-  derived  elongated  particles  in vitro  and in vivo on the atherosclerotic vessel wall of mice. 93 The authors also identified a formation mechanism that entails platelet adhesion, activation-  induced  disassembly  of  the  cytoskeleton  and flow-  induced membrane extraction from the platelet.

More  recently,  our  group  has  shown  that  neutrophils  release elongated neutrophil-  derived structures (ENDS) into the circulation of septic patients and mice. 16 ENDS form as their anchored microvilli are pulled out into long thin tethers and break off from the rolling cell. This process is dependent on the pulling force applied on the cell  surface,  as  indicated  by  the  correlation  between  the  number of  released  ENDS  and  the  magnitude  of  wall  shear  stress.  ENDS stain for the same surface markers as the parent neutrophil (Ly6G, CD11a, and CD11b in mice; CD66b, CD16, CD11a, and CD11b in humans) and have functional adhesion molecules. ENDS are 115 nm thin and median 7 Î¼ m long membrane-  covered structures that contain cytoplasm but no mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, or DNA (Figure  1  and  Table  1).  Proteomic  analysis  showed  that  ENDS  are enriched for several proteins and are rich in MRP8 and MRP14 (also called S100A8 and S100A9). Initially, the ENDS membrane is intact as indicated by its ability to exclude calcium and retain intracellular dyes such as Fluo4 or CMRA. Over the course of a few hours, ENDS expose PS on their surface as detected by Annexin-  5 binding. With degradation, ENDS release MRP8/14 complex, 16 which is a damageassociated  molecular  pattern  multimer  that  can  bind  TLR-  4  and can activate neutrophils and monocytes, but may also desensitize macrophages. 94 MRP8/14 is rapidly inactivated in the presence of calcium. 95 Since ENDS can exclude calcium from their lumen for a limited period, ENDS might help disseminate MRP8/14.

ENDS formation most likely depends on so far unidentified characteristics of the cells. During intravital imaging of mice, only about 6% of neutrophils left behind ENDS when in the same vessel (and hence under the same wall shear stress) where 94% of neutrophils did  not.  It  is  not  known  which  cellular  properties  might  promote tether formation and rupture of the tether. It is not known what happens to neutrophils that released ENDS. In vitro and in vivo experiments revealed that ENDS formation is accompanied by unstable neutrophil rolling. How and where these neutrophils leave the circulation is not known. One possibility could be rolling-  independent recruitment mechanisms such as in the lungs or liver. 96,97

## 7   CONCLUSION |

Neutrophils  release  various  membrane-  covered  structures  that occur  in  suspension,  on  vessel  walls  and  in  the  interstitial  space. These structures differ in mechanisms of release, size, shape, surface markers, and organelle content (Figure 1 and Table 2). All neutrophil

EVs are  membrane-  covered,  smaller  than  neutrophils,  and  cannot reproduce  themselves.  While  cytoplasts  retain  several  neutrophil functions,  including  migration,  phagocytosis,  and  degranulation, exosomes,  ectosomes,  ENDS,  and  migrasomes  are  non-  migrating structures. They likely extend the lifetime of their cargo by protecting it from the microenvironment.
