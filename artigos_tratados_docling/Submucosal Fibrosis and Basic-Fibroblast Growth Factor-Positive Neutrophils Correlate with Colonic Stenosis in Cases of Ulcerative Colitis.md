## Abstract

Background and Aims: The frequency of benign stenosis in ulcerative  colitis  (UC)  is  low,  reported  as  being  3.2-11.2%, with fibrosis in the submucosa or deeper pointed out as one of the causes. The aim of the present study was to assess stenosis in UC cases using immunostaining and to analyze differences between stenotic and nonstenotic cases, focusing on  basic-fibroblast  growth  factor  (b-FGF)  expression  and myofibroblasts. Methods: Totals of 9 stenotic and 17 nonstenotic UC cases were histopathologically examined and immunohistochemically stained for b-FGF,     -smooth muscle ùõÇ actin ( ùõÇ -SMA), CD34, CD68 and IL-6. To identify b-FGF-positive cells, double immunostaining for b-FGF and myeloperoxidase or CD68 was performed. Results: In addition to submucosal fibrosis, a significant increase of b-FGF-positive inflammatory  cells and  myofibroblasts  was  observed  in stenotic portions. Most b-FGF-positive cells were also posi-

or myeloperoxidase, and a correlation between b-FGFpositive  and  total  neutrophil  counts  was  found. Conclusions: One of the major causes of stenosis in long-standing UC is fibrosis in the bowel wall, possibly induced by infiltrating inflammatory neutrophils producing b-FGF.

## ntroduction I

n  ulcerative  colitis  (UC),  inflammation  is  usually I limited to the lamina propria and submucosa, and only rarely extends to the muscularis propria   [1]  . Therefore, severe intestinal stenosis is rare, in contrast to cases with Crohn's disease where it is found as a chronic complication. Edwards and Truelove   [2]   found benign strictures in 6.3% of UC cases, while De Dombal et al. [3] reported a figure of 11.2%. In 1992, Gumaste et al. [4] described benign strictures in 3.2% (37/1,156) of UC cases.

Three hypotheses have been proposed concerning the cause of benign strictures in UC cases   [5]  : (1) development of fibrosis in the submucosa and deeper   [6]  , (2) in-

flammation extending to the muscularis propria, and (3) ischemia and necrotic changes occurring during long duration  illness    [7]  .  However,  there  have  only  been  a  few reports concerning processes leading to fibrosis. Here, we focused our attention on lesions in the submucosa and deeper, and we tried to identify the cause of fibrosis histologically using surgically resected specimens with and without stenosis.

There have been many reports about factors regulating wound healing. In particular, basic-fibroblast growth factor (b-FGF) is known to promote neovascularization and cell proliferation in ulcer lesions of UC, and to contribute to mucosal regeneration   [8]  . In addition, in collagenous colitis,  b-FGF  stimulates  differentiation  of  fibroblasts and thereby leads to increased subepithelial collagen deposition   [9]  . Myofibroblasts expressing ùõÇ smooth -muscle actin (    -SMA) constitute one of the most imporùõÇ tant groups of cells in repair processes. In UC, it has been reported that     -SMA-positive cells are increased at the ùõÇ margins of deep ulcers   [10]  . Furthermore, Zurawski et al. [11] described CD34-positive capillaries to be increased in the intestinal walls with UC. Based on these reports, we  performed  immunostaining  of  b-FGF,      -SMA  and ùõÇ CD34 as part of our analysis.

## Methods

## Patients

From 1986 to 2009, 1,115 patients with UC presented at Kitasato University East Hospital. A total of 17 cases exhibited benign stenosis found by colonoscopy and barium enema based on the criteria of a diameter less than 50% of the neighboring colonic wall and difficulty in passage of a colonoscope   [12]  . Of these, 9 stenotic cases were surgically operated. For comparison, 17 nonstenotic cases which showed a similar clinical course (duration of disease more than 5 years, relapse more than 3 times and longterm steroid administration), and which were resected, were collected. Crohn's disease was carefully ruled out by the findings of diffuse colitis and frequent cryptitis and crypt abscess, as well as by the absence of epithelioid cell granuloma. The cases were further reviewed for scoring the Seo's ulcerative colitis activity index as follows: DAI = 60 ! presence of blood stool (0 or 1) + 13 ! presence of bowel movements (1-3) (/day) + 0.5 ! erythrocyte sedimentation rate (mm/h) - 4 ! hemoglobin (g/dl) - 15 ! albumin (g/dl) + 200   [13, 14]  . The stenotic sites of the 9 resected stenotic cases were: descending colon in 4 cases (44%), transverse colon in 3 cases (33%), sigmoid colon in 1 case and rectum in 1 case (11%). Subtotal colectomies were performed for all 26 cases in the present study.

## Measures

The resected colons were opened and fixed with 10% buffered formalin. Then, tissue blocks were longitudinally cut from along the whole length of the intestine, routinely processed, em-

bedded  in  paraffin  and  stained  with  hematoxylin-eosin.  The numbers  of  blocks  per  case  were  60.8 8 26.3  (mean 8 SD; range: 32-144). The right hemicolon (from cecum to middle of the transverse colon) and left hemicolon were examined independently. Similarly, the sums of longitudinal lengths of ulcers (UL2, UL3) and ulcer scars, (UL2s, UL3s) were measured separately for the right and left hemicolons. The distal margins, 20 cm from surgical distal stump in length, which included the rectosigmoid and were considered to be most influenced by longstanding inflammation, were also compared between stenotic and nonstenotic cases. In addition, selected sections were stained with Masson trichrome staining. Furthermore, we measured the thickness of the muscularis propria using an ocular micrometer, focusing on parts with the strongest fibrosis at stenotic sites. At identical sites of the nonstenotic cases, the thickness was also measured.

Representative sections of stenotic  and  nonstenotic  sites  (at least 20 cm distant from surgical distal stumps) of stenotic cases and identical parts of nonstenotic cases were chosen. Five fields of each section were examined to determine Matts scores (Matts 1, normal appearance; Matts 2, some infiltration of the mucosa or lamina propria with either round cells or polymorphs; Matts 3, much cellular infiltration in the mucosa, lamina propria and submucosa; Matts 4, presence of crypt abscesses, with much infiltration throughout all layers of mucosa; Matts 5, ulceration, erosion or necrosis of the mucosa, with cellular infiltration of some or all of its layers)   [15]  . For our study, Matts 1 was defined as mucosa with slight infiltration of the lamina propria.

## mmunohistochemistry I

mmunohistochemical staining of 4I ùõç m thick paraffin sections was achieved using an Envision   kit (DAKO Cytomation, + Glostrup, Denmark), as in our previous studies   [16, 17]  . The primary monoclonal antibodies and their working dilutions were as follows:  mouse  anti-human      -SMA  antibody  (1A4,  1/1,000; ùõÇ DAKO),  mouse  anti-human  CD34  antibody  (QBEnd10,  1/200;

DAKO), rabbit anti-human b-FGF antibody (SC-79, 1/400; Santa Cruz, St. Louis, Mo., USA), mouse anti-human macrophage CD68 antibody  (PG-M1,  1/200;  DAKO),  and  goat  anti-interleukin-6 (IL-6) antibody (1/800; DAKO) was diluted in 10% blocking buffer. Endogenous peroxidase was blocked with 0.3% hydrogen peroxide in methanol for 15 min. Then, the sections were incubated with the primary antibodies at the given dilutions in phosphatebuffered  saline  over  night  at  room  temperature.  3-3   -di  ami-' nobenzidine was applied as the final chromogen, and nuclei were counterstained with hematoxylin or methyl green solution to facilitate histopathological assessment. For IL-6 immunostaining, biotinylated tyramide (0.07 ùõç M  ) treatment was added to amplify the reaction. For the immunohistochemical staining procedure, previously confirmed positive control slides were included.

The examined site was the lamina propria in the mucosa of Matts 1-4, and the submucosa of the ulcer margin in Matts 5. We  counted  the  b-FGF-positive  cells,  b-FGF  neutrophils,      ùõÇ SMA-positive  cells  (myofibroblasts),  CD34-positive  capillary cells  and  CD68-positive cells per 1 mm  using an ocular mi2 crometer. Also, to examine the ratios of b-FGF-positive cells to the total neutrophil number, the latter were counted using hematoxylin-eosin-stained sections at the same sites as for the bFGF-stained sections. For IL-6, the staining intensity of the epithelia was classified into 4 categories: 0, none; 1, weak; 2, moderate; 3, strong.

## Double Immunofluorescence Staining

Double immunofluorescence staining was performed to identify b-FGF and myeloperoxidase or CD68 inflammatory cells on histological sections for 3 representative UC cases. After deparaffinized histological sections were incubated with the primary anti-CD68  or  anti-myeloperoxidase  (A0398;  DAKO)  antibodies overnight at 4   ¬∞    C,  they  were  exposed to fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse or rabbit immunoglobulin, respectively, at 37    ¬∞    C for 30 min. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, they were incubated with the 2nd anti-b-FGF antibody and subsequently exposed to rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies at 37    ¬∞    C for 30 min. For staining of myeloperoxidase and b-FGF, microwave treatment in 0.01   M citrate buffer (10 min, pH = 6.0) was conducted before incubation with the 2nd antibody. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, the slides were observed under a fluorescence microscope (Olympus BX61 + UCB + DP71; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).

## Statistical Analysis

Statistical analyses were performed using the computer software Dr. SPSS (SPSS, Chicago, Ill., USA). Data were expressed as means 8 SD. Statistical significance was set at p ! 0.05. For sex and site of disease, comparisons were made using the     test. The ùõò 2 other clinical  data  and  the  b-FGF, ùõÇ SMA, CD34, and b-FGF--positive neutrophil ratios were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test with the Kruskal-Wallis test.

## Results

## Clinical Summary

Sex  ratio,  age  at  onset,  site  of  disease,  relapse  time, Seo's ulcerative colitis activity index and total dose of corticosteroid did not show significant differences. Only duration of disease of stenotic cases was significantly longer than that of nonstenotic cases (p = 0.013;   table 1  ).

## Histopathological Analyses

Lengths of UL2s and UL3s of stenotic cases were significantly higher than those of nonstenotic cases (  table 2  ). When we compared only nonstenotic sites of distal 20 cm of  colorectum,  stenotic  cases  also  showed  significantly higher UL2s ratios than nonstenotic cases (p = 0.008;   table 3  ).

## Thickness of Muscularis Propria

The muscularis propria at stenotic sites of the stenotic cases was on average significantly thicker than that of the nonstenotic cases (p = 0.006;   table 4  ). However, the muscularis propria of 4 of 9 stenotic cases was not thickened.

the  nonstenotic  sites  of  both  stenotic  and  nonstenotic ases (p c ! 0.001).

The inflammation grade was classified into 3 categories: Matts score 1, 2-3 and 4-5. When the findings at the same  inflammation  grade  were  compared  among  the 3 groups (stenotic site of stenotic cases, nonstenotic site of  stenotic  cases,  nonstenotic  cases),  the  myofibroblast count was higher at the stenotic than at the nonstenotic sites  of  stenotic  cases,  and  of  nonstenotic  cases  in  the Matts score 4-5 group (p ! 0.001). In the stenotic sites of stenotic cases, the myofibroblast count increased with the degree of inflammation (p    0.001;   fig. 1  a,   2  ). !

## CD34-Positive Capillary Counts

There was a tendency for the capillary count to increase with the degree of inflammation, but no significant  differences  were  observed  among  the  3  groups (  fig. 1  b).

## b-FGF-Positive Cell Counts

n the Matts 4-5 group, the b-FGF-positive cell count I at the stenotic sites of stenotic cases was higher than in

Comparing  across  groups,  the  Matts  2-3  and  4-5 groups generally showed higher numbers than the Matts 1 group. Particularly, b-FGF counts showed a gradual increase with the degree of inflammation in both stenotic and nonstenotic sites of stenotic cases (  fig. 1  c,   3  ).

## nflammatory Cell Infiltration I

n both stenotic cases and nonstenotic cases, total neuI trophil counts increased with the inflammation grade. However, the b-FGF-positive neutrophil rate was only elevated in stenotic sites of stenotic cases (  fig. 1  d). In addition, the correlation between total neutrophil and b-FGFpositive neutrophil counts was significant in both stenotic and nonstenotic cases. The slope of the regression line was  significantly  greater  in  the  stenotic  cases  than  in nonstenotic cases (p ! 0.001;   fig. 1  e).

The CD68-positive macrophage count in stenotic sites of stenotic cases was significantly higher than that in the nonstenotic sites of both stenotic and nonstenotic cases (p ! 0.001;   fig. 1  f).

## Discussion

n the present study, the value for benign stenotic casI es in our UC series was very low, at 1.5%, not quite in line with the reported values of 3.2-11.2%   [2-4]  . We, in the present study, defined stenosis with the criteria of a diameter less than 50% of the neighboring colonic wall and difficulty in passage of a colonoscope   [12]  . In comparison to 'constant narrowing of the lumen' as the previous definition of stenosis   [3, 4]  , we believe that these more strict criteria resulted in the low frequency figure. The duration from the onset of UC to stenosis was reported as 14.5 years by Gumaste et al.   [4]  . Our data indicated  15.6 8 8.6  years,  a  generally  similar  figure. Clearly, long-duration patients are more likely to suffer from stenosis.

Fibrosis in the submucosa or deeper has been cited as a possible cause of stenosis   [6]  . In the present study, although no difference in ulcer formation between cases with and without stenosis was observed, ulcer scar formation was more severe in cases with stenosis (  table 2  ). In addition, scarring was greater at nonstenotic sites of stenotic cases than in nonstenotic cases (  table 3  ). These data indicate that stenotic cases are more likely to suffer from fibrosis. In Crohn's disease, Bousvaros et al. [18] reported that  b-FGF  stimulates  fibroblasts,  resulting  in  fibrotic stenosis. Myofibroblasts also have important roles in hepatic fibrosis   [19] and pancreatic duct stenosis in cancer cases   [20]  . Furthermore, Chowdhury et al. [21] reported that b-FGF is important as an induction factor for myofibroblasts and Inoue et al. [22] have provided evidence that b-FGF is a potent mitogenic factor for smooth muscle cells, myofibroblasts and fibroblasts, the proliferation of which is a hallmark of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and lymphangioleiomyomatosis.

Using Matts grade for classification of severity of inflammation, a significant increase of b-FGF-positive inflammatory cells and myofibroblasts was observed here in stenotic portions (  fig. 1  a, c). Double immunostaining further revealed that the main inflammatory cells were neutrophils, not macrophages (  fig. 4  ). Th√∂rn et al. [23] described  the  concentration  of  b-FGF  in  the  intestinal juice  of  UC  patients  to  significantly  correlate  with  the myeloperoxidase concentration, indicating activation of neutrophils.  Our  results  also  showed  a  correlation  between inflammation grade and the b-FGF-positive neutrophil count, and between the b-FGF-positive and total neutrophil counts (  fig. 1  d, e).

From these findings, we conclude that b-FGF-positive neutrophils may induce proliferation of myofibroblasts,

and that this possibly results in fibrosis, particularly in stenotic portions.

What is the factor stimulating b-FGF production? As one  candidate,  IL-6  produced  by  T  cells  and  macrophages deserves mention. IL-6 transsignaling through translocation  of  a  signal  transducer  and  activator  of transcription  3  produces  proinflammatory  cytokines, namely, tumor necrosis factor-    , IL-8, and again IL-6, ùõÇ and can finally activate neutrophils and fibroblasts   [24]  . Li et al. [25] recently reported elevated IL-6 expression in the epithelium of active UC cases. In the present study, although  immunohistochemical  expression  was  weak, IL-6 epithelial expression in stenotic sites was stronger than that in the mucosa of nonstenotic cases (  fig. 5  b, f, i). Although the major source of IL-6 is considered to be inflammatory cells including macrophages, IL-6 generated by epithelial cells might also be correlated with bFGF production and fibrosis. Further study is necessary, including  cell  or  animal  experiments,  to  define  this point.

Crohn's  disease  is  known  to  be  characterized  by thickening of smooth muscle, which is considered as one of the causes of stenosis   [26, 27]  . However, in UC, thickening of proper muscle does not appear to be the primary cause of stenosis, as in our present study, 4 of 9 stenotic cases showed no significant thickening of proper muscle.

n  conclusion,  the  cause  of  colonic  stenosis  in  longI standing UC is fibrosis, possibly induced by inflammatory neutrophils producing b-FGF.
