Keywords: Neutrophil Ll-17 Mycobacterium tuberculosis

Rheumatoid arthritis

To our knowledge, no studies have examined the role of IL-17 production by neutrophils in immune defense against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infection and the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) caused by MTB infection. Here, we determined that neutrophils express IL-17 in an autocrine IL-6- and IL-23dependent manner during MTB infection. MTB H37Rv-induced IL-6 production was dependent on the NFκ B, p38, and JNK signaling pathways; however, IL-23 production was dependent on NFκ B and EKR in neutrophils. Furthermore, we found that Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and TLR4 mediated the activation of the kinases NFκ B, p38, ERK, and JNK and the production of IL-6, IL-23, and IL-17 in neutrophils infected with MTB H37Rv. Autocrine IL-17 produced by neutrophils played a vital role in inhibiting MTB H37Rv growth by mediating reactive oxygen species production and the migration of neutrophils in the early stages of infection. However, IL-17 production by neutrophils contributed to collagen-induced arthritis development during MTB infection. Our /uniFB01 ndings identify a protective mechanism against mycobacteria and the pathogenic role of MTB in arthritis development.

## 1. Introduction

Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), the main causal pathogen in tuberculosis, has infected one-third of the world's population and has becomeaseverethreatto human health. Upon infection with MTB, several factors contribute to the disease outcome, and cell-mediated immunity represents one of the most critical determinants (Dorhoi et al., 2011; Cooper, 2009). To date, several cells have been shown to participate in the host response against MTB, such as T cells, macrophages, dendritic cells and neutrophils (Sia et al., 2015; Lerner et al., 2015). Due to the host immune responses, only 10% of affected individuals show evidence of symptoms and develop the clinical disease. However, there are still estimated 8 -9 million new cases and 2 -3 million deaths from tuberculosis annually. Furthermore, because MTB is a strong immunogen and often results in an uncontrolled immune responses (Dorhoi et al., 2011), MTB infection is associated with many autoimmune diseases, e.g. systemic lupus erythematosus (Singh et al., 2013), rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (Shen et al., 2015) and multiple sclerosis (Fragoso et al., 2014). RA is a chronic in /uniFB02 ammatory disease characterized by synovitis leading to the destruction of articular cartilage and bone. Several studies have demonstrated that MTB is capable of promoting the development of RA in patients and in a mouse model (Shen et al., 2015; Kanagawa

et al., 2015). Extensive clinical investigations have shown that a previous history of tuberculosis is associated with RA (Shen et al., 2015). The relationship between the immune system and MTB is highly complex and is not yet fully understood. To study host immune responses initiated by MTB infection, it is necessary to understand the mechanisms of MTB immune control and the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases associated with MTB infection.

Neutrophils are an essential component of the innate immune system; they act as a /uniFB01 rst line of defense against invading microorganisms and fungi (Eum et al., 2010; Borregaard, 2010). These highly motile cells are rapidly recruited to infection sites and can destroy invading pathogens by both oxidative and nonoxidative mechanisms, i.e., by the phagocytosis of the microorganisms themselves or by the extracellular release of microbicidal granules (Amulic et al., 2012). In MTB infection, neutrophils form the bulk of the early recruited leukocyte population involved in immune responses against MTB (Martineau et al., 2007). After recognizing MTB via pattern recognition receptors, especially Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and TLR4 (Akira et al., 2006), neutrophils exhibit phagocytosis, which in turn triggers signaling events resulting in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Yang et al., 2012) and secretion of pro-in /uniFB02 ammatory cytokines, such as IL-1, IL-6, IL-23 and TNFα (Bardoel et al., 2014; Mantovani et al., 2011), which mediate early in /uniFB02 ammatory responses (Lowe et al., 2012). Noteworthy, while neutrophils provide immune protection against pathogens, they also promote tissue injury in in /uniFB02 ammatory diseases and contribute to autoimmune diseases via the production of cytokines.

IL-17A (referred to as ' IL-17 here) contributes to protection against ' bacterial infections, but also to the pathogenesis of autoimmune and in/uniFB02 ammatory disease (Iwakura et al., 2011). Studies have shown the importance of IL-17 in various physiological and pathophysiological processes, including host defense against MTB infections (Torrado and Cooper, 2010) and RA (Pope and Shahrara, 2013). Although the Th17 subset of helper T cells is considered to be the main source of IL-17, natural killer T cells (NKT cells), γδ T cells and innate lymphoid cells produce IL-17 more rapidly than do T cells (Cua and Tato, 2010; Isailovic et al., 2015). Neutrophils have also been identi /uniFB01 ed as a source of IL-17 in human psoriatic lesions (Lin et al., 2011), patients with corneal ulcers caused by /uniFB01 lamentous fungi (Karthikeyan et al., 2011), and several mouse models of infectious and autoimmune in /uniFB02 ammation (Ferretti et al., 2003; Hoshino et al., 2008; Li et al., 2010). No studies have examined the role of IL-17 production by neutrophils in immune defense against MTB infection and the pathogenesis of RA associated with MTB infection.

In the present study, we found that after infection with MTB, neutrophils expressed Il17a transcripts as well as the IL-17 protein, and this expression was dependent on not only paracrine IL-6 and IL-23, but also on autocrine IL-6 and IL-23. IL-6 and IL-23 levels in neutrophils were regulated by different pathways mediated by TRL2 and TLR4. On the one hand, MTB-induced IL-17 production by neutrophils increased MTB killing activity by enhancing ROS production and the migration of in /uniFB02 ammatory cells at the early stage of infection; on the other, it promoted arthritis severity in a collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model.

## 2.3. MTB Infection of Mice

8-week-old female mice were inoculated intratracheally (i.t.) with 1 × 10 6 colony-forming units (CFU) of MTB H37Rv in 50 μ l of PBS. Bacterial burden was determined by plating serial dilutions of lung and spleen homogenates onto 7H10 agar plates (BD Difco, USA) supplemented with 10% OADC. Plates were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 3 weeks before counting colonies.

## 2.4. Preparation of Splenocyte Supernatants

After 3 days, serum was collected from blood obtained from the retro-orbital sinuses, and then MTB-infected mice were asphyxiated

by inhalation of CO2 and spleens were removed. Single-cell suspensions were prepared, red blood cells were lysed and 1 × 10 6 spleen cells were incubated in RPMI 1640 medium (Thermo Fisher Scienti /uniFB01 c, USA) containing 10% FBS (Thermo Fisher Scienti /uniFB01 c) for 18 h. The cultural supernatants of splenocytes were collected.

## 2.5. Isolation of Mouse Bone Marrow Neutrophils

Total bone marrow cells were recovered from the femurs and tibias by /uniFB02 ushing with RPMI medium with an 18-gauge needle; erythrocytes were lysed with a commercial lysis buffer (eBioscience, USA) and bone marrow cells were separated by density centrifugation with a discontinuous Percoll gradient (52%, 69% and 78%; Fisher, USA). Cells at the 69% 78% interface were harvested, and neutrophil purity ( -N 98%) was con /uniFB01 rmed by /uniFB02 ow cytometry.

## 2.6. Human Neutrophils

Human neutrophils were isolated from the peripheral blood of healthy donors by Ficoll centrifugation. Neutrophil layer was washed and assessed by /uniFB02 ow cytometry.

## 2.7. In Vitro Stimulation

Mouse and human neutrophils, suspended at a density of 1 × 106 cells/ml, were incubated in RPMI 1640 medium (Thermo Fisher Scienti /uniFB01 c) containing 10% FBS (Thermo Fisher Scienti /uniFB01 c), followed by culture with MTB H37Rv at a MOI of 5, 100 ng/ml LPS, 100 ng/ml Pam3CSK4, mixture of Pam3CSK4 and LPS or PBS. For cytokine-neutralization studies, 20 μ g/ml ( /uniFB01 nal concentration) of antibody to mouse or human IL-6, IL-23, IL-1 β or TGFβ (R&amp;D, USA) was added into supernatants of splenocytes or neutrophils 2 h before stimulation in vitro. For signal pathway-inhibition studies, the NFκ B-inhibitor JSH-23, PI3K-inhibitor LY294002, MEK1/2-inhibitor U0126, p38 inhibitor-SB203580 or JNKinhibitor SP600125 (Selleck, USA) was added into supernatants of neutrophils.

## 2.8. Quantitative PCR

Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. For mRNA, /uniFB01 rststrand cDNA synthesis was performed using RevertAid First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo Fisher Scienti /uniFB01 c). An Eppendorf Master Cycle Realplex2 and SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, USA) were used for real-time PCR (40 cycles). PCR products were then separated by electrophoresis through a 1% agarose gel and were visualized by being stained with ethidium bromide. The primer sequences used for PCR are in Supplementary Table 1.

## 2.9. Flow Cytometry

For surface staining, neutrophils were harvested, washed and stained for 30 min on ice with mixtures of /uniFB02 uorescently conjugated mAbs or isotype-matched controls. mAbs of human were as follows: FITC-CD15, PE-CD16 (eBioscience). mAbs of mice were as follows:PECD11b, FITC-Gr-1 (eBioscience). For intracellular staining, cells were incubated 20 min in IC Fixation buffer (eBioscience), followed by permeabilization buffer (eBioscience) and 1 h of incubation with appropriate antibodies:APC-IL-17. Cell phenotype was analyzed by /uniFB02 ow cytometry on a /uniFB02 ow cytometer (BD LSR II) (BD Biosciences, USA). Data were acquired as the fraction of labeled cells within a live-cell gate and analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star). All gates were set on the basis of isotype-matched control antibodies.

## 2.10. ELISA

Cytokines were quanti /uniFB01 ed by two-site enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay according to the manufacturer's directions (R&amp;D).

## 2.11. Western Blotting

Cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS and then lysed in lysis buffer containing 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl /uniFB02 uoride, 1% (vol/ vol) protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma Aldrich, USA), and 1 mM DTT. Equal amounts (20 mg) of cell lysates were resolved using 8 -15% polyacrylamide gels transferred to PVDF membrane. Membranes were blocked in 5% non-fat dry milk in PBST and incubated overnight with the respective primary antibodies at 4 °C. The membranes were incubated at room temperature for 1 h with appropriate HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies and visualized with Plus-ECL (PerkinElmer, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol.

## 2.12. Neutrophil Depletion Assay

For neutrophil depletion, 0.5 mg of 1A8 monoclonal (anti m Ly-6G; BioXcell, USA) was injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) for 4 days once a day from the day before the infection. 2A3 isotype control Ab (Rat IgG2a; BioXcell) was also injected i.p. as control. To evaluate neutrophil depletion, blood samples from orbital were withdrawn and analyzed by /uniFB02 ow cytometry after staining with PE anti-CD11b (eBioscience) and FITC anti-Gr-1 antibody (eBioscience).

## 2.13. In Vitro MTB Killing Assay

Neutrophils were allowed to adhere to 24-well /uniFB02 at bottom plates at 5 × 10 5 cells per well and infected with MTB H37Rv at a MOI of 5 for 1 h at 37 °C with 5% CO2, then wells were extensively washed with prewarmedPBStoremovenon-adherentbacteria. The cells were incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for time points up to 24 h, and then were lysed in 1 ml of distilled water. Bacterial burden was determined by plating serial dilutions onto 7H10 agar plates supplemented with 10% OADC. Plates were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 3 weeks before counting colonies. All infections were performed in triplicate.

## 2.14. Adoptive Transfer

Cd18 --/ mice were infected with MTB H37Rv as described above. After 3 h, bone marrow neutrophils from WT or Il17a - -/ mice were isolated, washed and adoptively transferred via tail vein into Cd18 --/ recipient mice (2 × 10 6 cells/mouse/2 days) in 100 μ l of PBS. MTB H37Rv-infected mice were sacri /uniFB01 ced on different days. Lung from some infected mice were collected and digested in collagenase (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) at different days, and cells were incubated with Gr-1. Bacterial burden was determined by plating serial dilutions of lung and spleen homogenates onto 7H10 agar plates supplemented with 10% OADC. In a second mouse model, Cd18 - -/ recipient mice were used to induce CIA model.

## 2.15. CIA Model

CIA was induced in C57BL/6 mice as previously described(Brand et al., 2007). The experimental CIA model was generated by injecting 100 μ l of an emulsion containing 100 μ g of chicken type II collagen (Sigma Aldrich) intradermally at the base of the tail. The basic emulsion was composed of 2 mg/ml chicken type II collagen dissolved in PBS and an equal volume of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) with 5 mg/ml of desiccated MTB H37Ra (Difco). At 21 days after the /uniFB01 rst injection, the second immunizations were performed. Clinical symptoms of arthritis were then evaluated visually in each limb and graded on a scale of 0 -4; 0 = no evidence of erythema and swelling, 1 = erythema and

mild swelling con /uniFB01 ned to the tarsals or ankle joint, 2 = erythema and mild swelling extending from the ankle to the tarsals, 3 = erythema and moderate swelling extending from the ankle to metatarsal joints, 4 = erythema and severe swelling encompass the ankle, foot and digits, or ankylosis of the limb. The clinical score for each mouse was calculated as the sum of scores for all four limbs (maximum score 16). At the time mice were killed, paws were removed and /uniFB01 xed in 10% (vol/vol) neutral-buffered formalin for at least 2 days. Joints were decalci /uniFB01 ed for at least 2 days in decalci /uniFB01 cation buffer (0.4 M HCl, 0.5 M acetic acid, 0.2 M chloroform in 70% [vol/vol] ethanol), which was changed daily. Joints were then embedded in paraf /uniFB01 n and frontal sections (5 μ m) were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E).

## 2.16. Statistical Analysis

An unpaired t -test and one-way analysis of variance with Tukey's post-hoc analysis (Prism; GraphPad Software) was used for statistical analysis of each experiment using. A P value of b 0.05 was considered signi /uniFB01 cant.

## 3. Results

## 3.1. MTB H37Rv Induced IL-17 Production of Neutrophils

To determine if neutrophils could be induced to express IL-17 by MTB H37Rv, we injected wild-type (WT) C57BL/6 mice and Il6 - -/ mice intratracheally with MTB H37Rv. Three days later, we examined IL-17 production in neutrophils from the spleens of naive mice and from those of infected mice by intracellular cytokine staining and /uniFB02 ow cytometry. We found that Gr-1 + neutrophils isolated from infected WT mice, but not naive or Il6 - -/ mice, contained intracellular IL-17 (Fig. 1a). Total bone marrow cells from naive mice or from infected mice were isolated, and incubated in the supernatants of splenocytes from the same mice. We found that there were no bone marrow cells stimulated by supernatants of splenocytes from naive mice with intracellular IL-17, but 11.8% of bone marrow cells stimulated by supernatants of splenocytes from WT infection mice, which were all Gr-1 + (Fig. 1b). In contrast, we did not detect IL-17 + bone marrow cells in Il6 --/ mice (Fig. 1b). Gr-1 + bone marrow cells from infected Rag2 - -/ -Il2rg - -/ mice (T cell and natural killer (NK) cell de /uniFB01 ciency) were also positive for IL-17, indicating that T cells and NK cells were not required for IL-17 production by neutrophils (Supplementary Fig. 1a).

Furthermore, to assess IL-17 expression, neutrophils were isolated from the bone marrow and spleen by gradient centrifugation ( N 98% Gr-1 + ) (Supplementary Fig. 1b) and isolated neutrophils were not contaminated by γδ T (Supplementary Fig. 1c). Neutrophils stimulated by the supernatants of splenocytes from MTB H37Rv-infected WT mice expressed Il17a mRNA and IL-17 protein, but those stimulated by the supernatants of splenocytes from naive mice did not (Fig. 1c, d). In addition, γδ T cells could also be stimulated to produce IL-17.

Studies have reported that IL-6, IL-23, IL-1 β and transforming growth factorβ (TGFβ ) mediate IL-17 expression in lymphoid cells (Korn et al., 2009), but only IL-6 and IL-23 are potential inducers of IL17 production in neutrophils (Taylor et al., 2014). Because the supernatant of splenocytes was able to induce IL-17 expression in neutrophils, we investigated the soluble factors responsible for the induction of IL17 in neutrophils. We found that the supernatants of splenocytes from MTB H37Rv-infected WT mice had high concentrations of IL-6, IL-23, IL-1 β and TGFβ (Fig. 1e). Importantly, neutrophils were isolated and incubated for 1 h with supernatants of splenocytes in the presence of neutralizing antibodies and Il17a expressions levels were analyzed by quantitative PCR. Neutralization of either IL-6 or IL-23, but not IL-1 β or TGFβ , in the supernatants of splenocytes ablated its IL-17 induction activity (Fig. 1f). Together, these results demonstrated that in response to MTB infection, neutrophils expressed transcripts encoding IL-17 as

well as the IL-17 protein, and IL-6 and IL-23 are required for the induction of IL-17.

3.2. Autocrine IL-6 and IL-23 Induced IL-17 Production in Neutrophils With MTB H37Rv Infection

Because neutrophils are also the main source of IL-6 and IL-23 in immune responses, mediating the severity of autoimmune diseases and contributing to protection against bacterial infections (Morris et al., 2013; D'Elios et al., 2007; Kvedaraite et al., 2016), we examined the roles of autocrine IL-6 and IL-23 in IL-17 production by neutrophils

during MTB H37Rv infection. We detected Il6 , Il23 , and Il17a mRNA (Fig. 2a) and IL-6, IL-23, and IL-17 protein (Fig. 2b) in puri /uniFB01 ed neutrophils infected with MTB H37Rv in vitro. Furthermore, 20.3% of total neutrophils were IL-17 + 24 h after MTB H37Rv infection (Fig. 2c). Of note, IL-17 expression displayed a delayed kinetics compared to IL-6 and IL23, suggesting that the inducible expression of IL-17 was potentially related to autocrine IL-6 and IL-23. Furthermore, neutrophils isolated fromIL-17A-GFP miceand infected with MTB H37Rv contained intracellular IL-17, but those from naive IL-17A -GFP mice did not (Supplementary Fig. 2a). We used PCR to con /uniFB01 rmed that Il17a was lacking after the neutralization of either IL-6 or IL-23 (Fig. 2d). The receptors for IL-17A

contain IL-17RA and IL-17RC subunits. IL-17RC is not constitutively expressed by neutrophils, but can be inducibly expressed (Taylor et al., 2014). Consistent with previous reports, we found that IL-17RC expression could be induced after MTB H37Rv infection (Supplementary Fig. 2b).

Because Ly6G is mainly expressed in neutrophils and the anti-Ly6G monoclonal antibody (mAb) is widely used for neutrophil depletion studies (Daley et al., 2008), the anti-Ly6G mAb was used to directly assess if neutrophils are the source of IL-6, IL-23 and IL-17 in mice with MTB H37Rv infection. The anti-Ly6G mAb speci /uniFB01 cally depleted neutrophils, but not monocytes (Supplementary Fig. 2c). Serum from antiLy6G mAb-treated mice had lower concentrations of IL-6, IL-23 and IL17 than those of serum from isotype control mAb-treated mice (Fig. 2e). Together these observations indicated that autocrine IL-6

and IL-23 induced IL-17 production by neutrophils in MTB H37Rv infection.

3.3. MTB H37Rv-induced IL-6 Production was Dependent on the NFκ B, p38 and JNK Signaling Pathways and IL-23 Production was Dependent on NFκ B and EKR in Neutrophils

Neutrophils are the main source of IL-6 and IL-23, but the speci /uniFB01 c molecular pathways that mediate IL-6 and IL-23 production in neutrophils remain unknown. The production of many cytokines by neutrophils is known to be regulated by NFκ B-, PI3K-AKT-, or MAPK (ERK, p38, and JNK)-dependent signaling pathways; accordingly, we evaluated the role of these pathways in IL-6, IL-23, and IL-17 production by neutrophils in MTB H37Rv infection. We found that stimulation of

neutrophils with MTB H37Rv led to enhanced phosphorylation of NFκ B p65, AKT, ERK1/2, p38, and JNK (Fig. 3a). We then used the NFκ B inhibitor JSH-23, PI3K inhibitor LY294002, MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126, p38 inhibitor SB203580, and JNK inhibitor SP600125 and found that the phosphorylation of these proteins was decreased for a range of inhibitor concentrations (Supplementary Fig. 3). Next we examined the effect of inhibiting the phosphorylation of these proteins on IL-6 and IL-23 production. We found that JSH-23, SB203580, and SP600125 observably inhibited IL-6 production, but LY294002 and U0126 no effect (Fig. 3b). IL-23 production was inhibited by JSH-23 and U0126, but not by SB203580, LY294002 or SP600125 (Fig. 3b). Furthermore, Il17a mRNA levels and IL-17 protein levels after induction by MTB H37Rv were signi /uniFB01 cantly reduced in neutrophils treated with JSH-23, U0126, SB203580, and SP600125 (Fig. 3c). These /uniFB01 ndings demonstrate that MTB H37Rv-induced IL-6 production was dependent on the NFκ B, p38 and JNK signaling pathways and IL-23 production was dependent on NFκ B and EKR in neutrophils. Autocrine IL-6 and IL-23-induced IL17 production in neutrophils with MTB H37Rv infection was regulated by various signaling pathways.

3.4. MTB H37Rv-induced IL-6 and IL-23 Production by Neutrophils was Dependent on TLR2 and TLR4

Pattern recognition receptors play a major role in triggering proin/uniFB02 ammatory cytokine production and phagocytic antimicrobial pathways in MTB infection, especially TLR2 and TLR4. To examine whether these TLRs are responsible for the MTB H37Rv-induced IL-6 and IL-23 cytokine responses, neutrophils were isolated from the bone marrow of Tlr2 - -/ and Tlr4 - -/ mice and infected with MTB H37Rv in vitro. We found that the phosphorylation of p65, AKT, p38, ERK, and JNK was suppressed in Tlr2 - -/ and Tlr4 - -/ neutrophils compared to WT neutrophils (Fig. 4a). To assess the expression of IL-6 and IL-23, we performed ELISA and found that IL-6 and IL-23 expression levels were markedly lower in the supernatants of Tlr2 - -/ and Tlr4 - -/ neutrophils than in the supernatants of WT neutrophils (Fig. 4b). Furthermore, we tested the roles of TLR2 and TLR4 in IL-17 production by neutrophils. In response to MTB H37Rv stimulation, Tlr2 - -/ and Tlr4 - -/ neutrophils

reduced intracellular IL-17 production as well as extracellular IL-17 secretion (Fig. 4c, d).

To further assess the roles of TLR2 and TLR4 in IL-6, IL-23, and IL-17 production in neutrophils, we used Pam3CSK4 and LPS to activate TLR2 and TLR4 in neutrophils. First, we assessed the expression of IL-6 and IL23 by ELISA, and found that IL-6 and IL-23 expression levels increased markedly in WT neutrophils after Pam3CSK4 and LPS treatment (Fig. 4e). Furthermore, Il17a mRNA was detected in WT neutrophils after Pam3CSK4 and LPS treatment (Fig. 4f). These results showed that TLR2/TLR4, which regulates various downstream signaling pathways, played a major role in MTB H37Rv-induced IL-6 and IL-23 production in neutrophils.

3.5. Human Neutrophils Produced IL-17 Via Autocrine IL-6 and IL-23 After MTB H37Rv Infection

To ascertain the role of autocrine IL-6 and IL-23 in inducing IL-17 production in human neutrophils after MTB H37Rv infection, we isolated a highly puri /uniFB01 ed population of human peripheral blood neutrophils by gradient centrifugation and infected with MTB H37Rv. We detected IL-6 and IL-23 in neutrophils (Fig. 5a). Furthermore, intracellular IL-17 was detected in about 20% of the total neutrophil population (Fig. 5b). Next, we detected Il17a expression in neutrophils, and found that its expression was inhibited in the presence of anti-IL-6 or anti-IL-23 but not in the presence of anti-IL-1 β or anti-TGFβ (Fig. 5c).

To evaluate the role of signaling pathways and TLRs in IL-6, IL-23 and IL-17 production by human neutrophils, inhibitors or agonists were used. Similar to mouse neutrophils, IL-6 production was inhibited by JSH-23, SB203580 and SP600125, IL-23 production was inhibited by JSH-23 and U0126 (Fig. 5d), and IL-17 production was inhibited by the above-mentioned inhibitors (Fig. 5e). IL-6, IL-23 and IL-17 were detected in human neutrophils after LPS and Pam3CSK4 treatment (Fig. 5f, g). Together, these /uniFB01 ndings demonstrated that similar to mouse neutrophils, autocrine IL-6 and IL-23 induced IL-17 expression in neutrophils after MTB H37Rv infection via TLR2 and TLR4- activated signaling pathways.

(a) Neutrophils were infected with MTB H37rv for the indicated time points, followed by immunoblot analysis of phosphorylated p65 (p-p65), p65, p-AKT, AKT, p-p38, p38, p-ERK, ERK, p-JNK, JNK and GAPDH with cell lysates.

3.6. IL-17 Production by Neutrophils Inhibited MTB H37Rv Growth

IL-17 is an important cytokine not only in early neutrophils recruitment but also in the release of cytotoxic mediators that enhance neutrophils antibacteria activity (Mantovani et al., 2011). To determine if autocrine IL-17 regulates neutrophil antibacterial ability in vitro, we infected neutrophils from the bone marrow of WT or Il17a - -/ mice with MTB H37Rv and then assessed viable bacilli based on colony-forming units (CFUs). We found that WT neutrophils exhibited potent killing activity, and the activity was further enhanced by recombinant mouse IL-17 or a combination of IL-6 and IL-23 (Fig. 6A). Conversely, compared to WT neutrophils, Il17a - -/ neutrophils exhibited impaired killing activity, which was recovered by IL-17, but not by a combination of IL-6 and IL-23 (Fig. 6a).

The production of ROS by neutrophils limits the growth of MTB (Yang et al., 2012) and autocrine IL-17 in neutrophils enhances ROS production in fungal infections (Taylor et al., 2014), accordingly, we examined if the role of IL-17 in MTB killing depends on ROS production. We assessed ROS production by measuring intracellular 2,7-dichlorodihydro /uniFB02 uorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA), and found lower ROS production by neutrophils from Il17a - -/ mice than by neutrophils obtained from WT mice (Fig. 6b). ROS production in WT neutrophils was further increased after further stimulation with IL-17 or a combination of IL-6 and IL-23 (Fig. 6b). However, ROS production was only increased after further stimulation with IL-17, but not by the combination of IL-6 and IL-23 in Il17a - -/ neutrophils (Fig. 6b).

Human peripheral blood neutrophils have a similar phenotype to that of mouse neutrophils, after treatment with an antibody against IL-17 ( α -IL-17), antibacterial activity was inhibited (Fig. 6c) and ROS

production was decreased (Fig. 6d); in contrast, antibacterial activity was enhanced (Fig. 6c) and ROS production was increased after stimulation with IL-17 (Fig. 6d).

Because β 2 integrin chain CD18-de /uniFB01 cient ( Cd18 - -/ ) neutrophils cannot migrate into infected tissues (Ding et al., 1999), to determine if IL-17-producing neutrophils regulate MTB growth in vivo, we used an adoptive-transfer model in which donor WT or Il17a - -/ neutrophils are injected intravenously into recipient Cd18 - -/ mice with MTB H37Rv infection. We found that there were signi /uniFB01 cantly fewer viable bacilli (Fig. 6e), but a greater number of total in /uniFB01 ltrated neutrophils (Fig. 6f) in the lung of Cd18 - -/ mice administered WT neutrophils than in mice administered Il17a - -/ neutrophils at the early phase of infection. However, the amount of viable bacilli and number of in /uniFB01 ltrated neutrophils were not different on days 7 or 14 after infection. Overall, these data indicated that autocrine IL-17 in neutrophils inhibited MTB growth by mediating ROS production and their own migration at the early phase of infection.

3.7. MTB H37Rv-induced IL-17 Production in Neutrophils Promoted CIA Development

Because MTB infection and IL-17 production in neutrophils is associated with both RA and CIA (Shen et al., 2015; Kanagawa et al., 2015; Pope and Shahrara, 2013), we assessed the role of MTB H37Rv-

induced IL-17 production by neutrophils in CIA. First, we con /uniFB01 rmed that mice infected with MTB H37Rv showed a signi /uniFB01 cantly elevated CIA arthritis incidence (Table 1) and clinical scores (Fig. 7a) compared to those of uninfected mice. An adoptive-transfer model was used to determine if MTB- induced-IL-17 production in neutrophils contributes to CIA. We observed a signi /uniFB01 cantly lower incidence (Table 2) and lower clinical scores (Fig. 7b) in MTB H37Rv-infected Cd18 - -/ mice given Il17a - -/ neutrophils relative to that given WT neutrophils. Additionally, we found that serum from Cd18 - -/ mice given Il17a - -/ neutrophils had lower IL-17 concentrations than those given WT neutrophils (Fig. 7c). Previous studies have shown that IL-17 has regulatory effects on the expression of pro-in /uniFB02 ammatory cytokines in mice with CIA, such as IL-6, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-3, IL-8, IFNγ , TNFα , IL-1 β and receptor activator for nuclear factorκ B ligand (RANKL) (Atkinson et al., 2016; Bai et al., 2014). We analyzed the role by IL-17 production of neutrophils in the expression of these target genes in mice with CIA exhibiting severe arthritis. Our results showed that cartilage tissue from Cd18 - -/ mice given Il17a - -/ neutrophils had lower expression levels of these pro-in /uniFB02 ammatorycytokines than those of tissues from mice given WT neutrophils (Supplementary Fig. 4). In /uniFB02 amed joints from Cd18 - -/ mice given WT neutrophils were extensively in /uniFB01 ltrated by in /uniFB02 ammatory cells and showed regions of bone and cartilage destruction (Fig. 7d). These results suggested that MTB H37Rv-induced IL-17 production in neutrophils contributed to CIA development.

## 4. Discussion

IL-17 is a proin /uniFB02 ammatory cytokine and is mainly secreted by CD4 + T, γδ T, and innate lymphoid cells as well as neutrophils. Previous reports have indicated that neutrophils are the main source of IL-17 in patients with fungal keratitis (Karthikeyan et al., 2011) diverse mouse models, including lipopolysaccharide-induced lung in /uniFB02 ammation (Ferretti et al., 2003), systemic histoplasmosis (Wu et al., 2013), acute kidney ischemia-reperfusion injury (Li et al., 2010), inhalation anthrax (Garraud et al., 2012) and early-stage arthritis (Katayama et al., 2013). Though IL-17 expression was not detected in neutrophils from M. bovis bacillus Calmette-Guérin infected mice (Umemura et al., 2007), in this study, we demonstrated that MTB H37Rv induced IL-17 production in neutrophils (Gr-1 + ) and this effect was dependent on paracrine and autocrine IL-6 and IL-23.

Our results supported those of previous studies indicating that IL-6 and IL-23 are essential for the expression of the gene encoding IL-17 in mouse and human neutrophils (Taylor et al., 2014). However, we demonstrated that neutrophil expression of IL-6 and IL-23 was also

induced by MTB H37Rv, and autocrine IL-6 and IL-23 were suf /uniFB01 cient to in /uniFB02 uence IL-17 production by themselves in neutrophils. IL-6 production by neutrophils has been linked to protection against mycobacterial infection (Morris et al., 2013), but it is not clear whether neutrophils express IL-23 after MTB H37Rv infection. IL-23 is produced by innate immune cells, especially dendritic cells (Langrish et al., 2004), but studies have con /uniFB01 rmed that neutrophil expression of IL-23 is induced by Helicobacter pylori neutrophil-activating protein (D'Elios et al., 2007), and tissue-in /uniFB01 ltrating neutrophils represent the main source of IL-23 in the colon of patients with in /uniFB02 ammatory bowel disease (Kvedaraite et al., 2016). In this study, we detected Il23 mRNA and IL23 protein in neutrophils infected with H37Rv. The IL-23 concentration decreased in the serum from MTB H37Rv-infected mice after the depletion of neutrophils.

Activation of proin /uniFB02 ammatory pathways, including NFκ B, PI3KAKT, p38, JNK, and ERK, initiates the production of cytokines in innate immune cells, such as macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells (Iwasaki and Medzhitov, 2004). It was previously reported that the activation of p38 and NFκ B mediates IL-6 production in neutrophils stimulated with LPS (Ajibade et al., 2012). However, we found that JNK also plays a critical role in activating the production of IL-6 except p38 and NF- B, but AKT or ERK no effect. Consistent with these κ /uniFB01 ndings, previous studies have shown that Brucella abortus rBCSP31 induced IL-6 production in macrophages via the activation of p38, JNK, and NFκ B (Li et al., 2014). Though neutrophils are able to express IL-23, the regulatory signaling pathways remain unclear. Previous studies have demonstrated that ERK activation is required for LPS-induced-IL-23 production in dendritic cells (Brereton et al., 2009) and HBV viral protein HBx-induced IL-23 expression in hepatitis B virus infection (Cho

et al., 2014). We demonstrated that the suppression of the phosphorylation of ERK and NFκ B decreases IL-23 production in neutrophils infected with MTB H37Rv, but AKT, p38, and JNK had no effect. However, distinct signaling pathways appear to be required for IL-23 production, which is positively regulated by PI3K and ERK, but negatively regulated by p38 MAPK in THP-1 cells infected with T. gondii RHstrain (Quan et al., 2015). These results indicate that IL-23 production is regulated by distinct signaling pathways in a cell type-speci /uniFB01 c manner.

Pattern recognition receptors of the innate immune system, especially TLR2 and TLR4, are critical for the recognition of MTB components and activation of proin /uniFB02 ammatory pathways. TLR2 and TLR4 activate a common signaling pathway that results in the activation of NFκ B, ERK, p38 and JNK (Akira et al., 2006). We investigated if TLR2 and TLR4, upstream pathways of NFκ B, ERK, p38, and JNK, are involved in the production of IL-6, IL-23, and IL-17 in MTB H37Rv-infected neutrophils. We found that TLR2 or TLR4 de /uniFB01 ciency suppressed the

phosphorylation of NFκ B, ERK, p38, and JNK and negatively regulated IL-6 and IL-23 synthesis in MTB H37Rv-infected neutrophils. In contrast, IL-6 and IL-23 production increased in response to Pam3CSK4 and LPS, agonists of TLR2 and TLR4. Taken together, levels of IL-6 and IL-23 in neutrophils were differentially regulated by the NFκ B and MAPK signaling pathways downstream of TLR2/4 signaling.

IL-17 is an important proin /uniFB02 ammatory cytokine not only in early neutrophil recruitment, but also in the release of cytotoxic mediators to enhance neutrophil antibacterial activity. However, data are equivocal with regard to whether IL-17 is required for protection against MTB; some, but not all studies suggest that it is required for the control of bacteria (Torrado and Cooper, 2010). In the present study, we evaluated the effect of IL-17 production by neutrophils on antibacterial activity in vitro. Neutrophils produced and used IL-17 in an autocrine manner to enhance ROS production and antibacterial activity. Consistent with these /uniFB01 ndings, autocrine activity of IL-17 induced the production of ROS and increased fungal killing (Taylor et al., 2014). Furthermore, we demonstrated that IL-17 production by neutrophils played a key role in neutrophil induction and antibacterial activity in the early phase in vivo using an adoptive-transfer model. Overall, our results indicate that IL-17 is required for the control of bacteria at the early phase of infection. Neutrophils function as phagocytic cells that mediate host defense by recognizing and destroying foreign infectious pathogens (Geissmann et al., 2010). However, neutrophils are less well studied than other components of the host response to MTB infection and previous results are controversial (Martineau et al., 2007; Lowe

et al., 2012; Borregaard, 2010). In this study, our data showed that a larger number of neutrophils were correlated with fewer viable bacilli at the early stage of MTB infection. Accordingly, neutrophils may play a role in MTB killing at the early stage of MTB infection.

IL-17 and neutrophils are both required for the control of bacteria, but they are unfortunately closely related to the occurrence and development of many autoimmune diseases, including RA (AbdollahiRoodsaz et al., 2008). Surprisingly, MTB infection is also capable of promoting the development of RA, but the mechanism remains unclear. It has previously been reported that neutrophils are an essential source of IL-17 in the effector phase of arthritis (Katayama et al., 2013). In this study, we also assessed the role of MTB-induced IL-17 production by neutrophils in CIA. Our results showed that the CIA arthritis incidence and clinical scores were elevated in MTB-infected mice. Furthermore, Cd18 - -/ mice given IL-17 - -/ neutrophils had a signi /uniFB01 cantly lower incidence and clinical scores relative to those of mice given WT neutrophils. MTB-induced IL-17 in neutrophils may play a vital role in the development of RA.

In conclusion, we found that neutrophils are able to express IL-17, and this expression was dependent on autocrine IL-6 and IL-23 during MTB infection. MTB-induced IL-17 production in neutrophils increased MTB killing activity, but promoted arthritis severity in a CIA model. These results demonstrate an anti-mycobacterial mechanism and a pathogenic role of MTB in arthritis development. They could therefore have important implications for the development of therapies for MTB infection-associated diseases, including tuberculosis and autoimmune diseases.
