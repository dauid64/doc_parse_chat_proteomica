## Abstract:

Background : Neutrophil  plays  a  defense  role  against  bacteria  and  fungi  specifically  by  the neutrophil phagoburst activity. The nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) test is the gold standard method to measure this but the flow cytometry assays also have been developed. The aim of the study was to evaluate the performance of flow cytometry using Dihydrorhodamine (DHR) 123 and to compare with the conventional NBT test. Methods: This study was carried out to determine the phagoburst activity at Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Medical Centre on 26 normal healthy donors and 5 chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients using both methods. Results: In flow cytometry,  higher  fluorescence  intensity  was  observed  in  Phorbol  myristate  acetate  (PMA) stimulated  neutrophils.  Comparing  the  mean  fluorescent  intensity  (MFI)  between  CML  and healthy donor showed CML patients have significant lower MFI (312.15 vs 738.22; p&lt;0.05) indicating poorer respiratory burst in CML patients. The PMA stimulated positive cells were higher in flow cytometry than the NBT (98.06% vs 87.5%). Although there was poor correlation between two methods, a good agreement between flow cytometry assay and NBT test results was observed in terms of positive and negative results in simulated and unstimulated cells. Moreover, in  flow  cytometry,  &gt;95%  of  stimulated  cells  suggest  the  higher  sensitivity. All  samples  with negative NBT showed negative DHR, reflecting high degree of agreement between these two methods and eliminating possible false negative result in flow cytometry. Conclusion: This study showed that flow cytometry assay has superior technical advantages compared to NBT test as it is easy to perform, quick, more sensitive and requires only a small amount of blood sample.

## Introduction

Neutrophil  plays  a  major  role  in  defense  against bacterial  and  fungal  pathogens.  It  rapidly  migrates to the inflamed tissues and activate the microbicidal mechanisms  by  releasing  proteolytic  enzymes  and antimicrobial peptides as well as producing oxidative

stress by increasing reactive oxygen species (ROS), a phenomenon  called  respiratory  oxidative  burst activity. 1,2,3 This respiratory burst activity is performed by multicomponent enzyme nicotinamide adenine  dinucleotide  phosphate  reduced  (NADPH) oxidase with an increase in oxygen consumption. 4,5

ROS  is  composed  of  superoxide  anion  (O2-)  and hydrogen  peroxide  (H2O2)  and  is  highly  toxic  to ingested microorganisms leading to bacterial killing, thus allowing the bactericidal action of neutrophil. 5,6

The  defect  in  neutrophil  activity  results  in  having  a  poor defense against infection which can be quantitative or  qualitative/  functional  defects.  The  functional defect with failure of reactive oxidative burst activity is well described in chronic granulomatous disorder (CGD) where the NADPH-oxidase function is  impaired  secondary  to  specific  mutations  in  the genes that encode their components. 7,8 The functional defect may also be seen secondary to haematological malignancy for example chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML).  9, 10

The reduce function in neutrophils is usually identified by Nitro Blue Tetrazolium (NBT) dye reduction test that uses the histochemical demonstration  of  intracytoplasmic  NBT  reduction (blue  dye  formazan).  The  reaction  depends  upon the  production  of  neutrophil  NADPH  oxidase. 5,11 and is based on a microscopic evaluation of stained neutrophils  for  the  presence  of  intracellular  blue dye  formazan.  This  makes  it  highly  dependent  on observer  experience. 12 It  also  involves  complicated steps,  requiring  a  large  amount  of  blood  and  timeconsuming  neutrophils  isolation  procedures  from whole blood. 13 PolymorPrep is a density media that is ready-made, sterile and endotoxin tested solution used for the isolation of neutrophils from whole blood. After cells separation procedure, the neutrophils layer needs to be isolated manually by skillful person. The utility of NBT test are in the detection and diagnosis of the primary immune disorder. 6, 10.14

The  use  of  flow  cytometry  has  been  introduced  to reliably identify the Primary immunodeficiency disorders by granulocyte activation 15 This technique uses  Dihydrorhodamine  (DHR)123  as  fluorogenic substrate where it is oxidized to rhodamine R123 by cellular hydrogen peroxide as a result of respiratory burst  activity  after  addition  of  stimulant  Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) in the sample. 11 The formation  of  intracellular  R123  gives  a  fluorescent signal that is detected and analyzed by flow. 5,6,11 This is the most sensitive technique available for detection of  phagoburst  activities  in  response  to  a  variety  of physiological and pathological conditions. 16 . As opposed  to  the  NBT  method,  the  flowcytometry requires  small  amount  of  blood  and  does  not  need the neutrophil isolation. Thus, this simple and highly sensitive assay can measure the phagoburst activity

in thousands of neutrophils very rapidly. 17,18

Currently, at Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Medical Centre (UKMMC), we are using the NBT test to measure  the  neutrophil  respiratory  burst activity. However, we are planning to introduce the DHR 123 flow  cytometry  assay.  It  is  important  to evaluate the DHR 123 flow cytometry assay in our current laboratory setting. The objective of this study was to evaluate DHR 123 flow cytometry assay in determining  neutrophils  respiratory  burst  activity and to compare it with the NBT test.

## Materials and Method

The study  was  carried  out  at  the  Immunology  and flow  cytometry  lab,  Department  of  Laboratory  and Diagnostic Services, UKMMC.

A  total  of  31  samples  were  included  in  this  study where  26  were  from  healthy  individuals  and  five were from CML patients. Healthy individuals were selected  randomly  from  adults  having  no  medical illness,  not  on  any  medication  and  having  normal absolute  neutrophil  count.  The  CML  cases  were selected  based  on  the  positive  BCR-ABL  status. All  the  participants  were  explained  about  the  test and  written  informed  consent  was  obtained  before sample taking.

Ten ml of fresh venous blood sample was collected from each participant  in  two  heparin  anticoagulant tubes with 5mls in each tube where one tube was run by DHR 123 flow cytometry assay and another for traditional NBT test. Both methods were run on the same day to reduce the variability of the results.

## DHR 123 flow cytometry assay

For  DHR  123  flow  cytometry  assay,  the    sample was  prcoessed  within  12  hours  of  collection.  The reagents were  prepared and the procedure was done  as  recommended  by  the  manufacturer.  Two 100μl  samples  were  taken  from  the  5ml  sample taken  earlier  and  placed  in  two  separate  falcon tubes and used as unstimulaed and stimulated tubes respectively.  The  blood  samples  were  incubated in an ice bath for 10 minutes to cool them down to 0°C.  Twenty  microliters  of  PMA  was  then  added to stimulant tube while 20 μl of PBS was added to the unstimulated tube and incubated at 37°C for 15 minutes followed by addition of  20 μl of working DHR 123 solutions to each tube  and re-incubate at 37⁰C for another 10 minutes. FACS lysing solutions (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA) were added to the tubes and left at room temperature for 20 minutes and

centrifuged. The supernatant was discarded and the cells were resuspended in washing solution and recentrifuged. Again the supernatant was discarded and replaced with DNA staining solution for cytometric discrimination of bacteria during leukocytes analysis. Upon  stimulation,  fluorescent  signal  was  detected and analyzed using a flow cytometer FACSCalibur E97501067 and FACSComp 6.0 software  using the blue-green excitation light (488 nm argon-ion laser).

Before acquiring data, a 'live' gate was set in the red fluorescence histogram on those events which had at least the same DNA content as human diploid cells (i.e.  exclusion  of  bacteria  aggregates  having  same scatter light properties as leukocytes (Figure 1A). The percentage of cells having produced reactive oxygen metabolites  were  analyzed  as  well  as  their  mean fluorescence  intensity  (MFI)  (amount  of  cleaved

substrate  activity).  For  that  purpose,  the  relevant neutrophil cluster was gated in the software program in the scatter gram of forward scatter (FSC) vs. side scatter (SC) (Figure 1B) and its green fluorescence-1 histogram  (FL1)  was  analyzed  (Figure 2). The neutrophil  population  was  identified  by  its  typical location  at  moderate  SC  and  selected  by  gating (Figure 1B).  A histogram of R123 fluorescence FL1 (Figure  2  A-D)  was  obtained  for  the  gated  region and  percentage  of  R123  positive  cell  that  reflects the  percentage  of  cells  having  produced  reactive oxygen metabolites were determined as well as the geometric mean recorded from the display statistics were noted. The MFI was automatically calculated by the analyzer and represents fluorescence intensity of stimulated neutrophils representing the degree of the neutrophil activity.

The population of neutrophils is differentiated by their characteristic size (FSC, x-axis) and granularity (SC, y-axis). In this representative unstimulated sample, the neutrophils population can be clearly identified, and has been gated as the population of interest.

## Nitroblue Tetrazolium Slide Test (NBT)

The NBT test performed according to the method of Gentle and Thompson.  19 The neutrophil was isolates from  5  ml  of  blood  sample  using  PolymorphPrep solution.  The  stimulated  and  unstimulated  tubes were  prepared  where  in  stimulated  tube  100  µl  of neutrophils suspension was mixed with 100µl of NBT and 100µl of PMA (stimulant) while in unstimulated tube,  100µl  of  neutrophils  suspension  was  mixed with  100µl  of  NBT  and  100µl  of  PBS.  The  tubes were  incubated  at  37°C  water  bath  for  10  minutes and further incubated at RT for 10 minutes. Smears of fixed cells were prepared and a total of 200 cells were counted microscopically. Neutrophils showing

formazan  deposits  were  recorded  as  positive.  The results were considered within normal range which is between 63-90% for PMA stimulated NBT positive cells and 0-38% for unstimulated NBT positive cells.

## Statistical analysis

Data  were  collected  immediately  after  performing the test and analyzed by Statistical Package for the Social  Sciences  (SPSS)  version-25.  For  the  DHR flow cytometric assay, fluorescent signal was detected for both PMA stimulated tube and the unstimulated tube.  Comparison  of  fluorescence  signal  by  PMA stimulation was done between the CML group and healthy donor group by Mann-Whitney U test.  For

the NBT test, NBT positive cells in PMA stimulated samples and in unstimulated samples were obtained. Data was obtained as percent values. Pearson Correlation study was done in order to determine the relationship between the two methods.

Ethical  clearance: This  study  commenced  once approval  from  the  research  ethics  committee  of UKMMC has been obtained.

## Results

## DHR 123 flow cytometry assay

The DHR flow cytometry assay was performed within less  than  one  hour.  In  figure-2,  the  flowcytometry analysis  results  for  both  control  and  CML  groups showed unstimulated sample have low R123 fluorescence  intensity  of  &lt;10 1 whereas  the  PMA stimulated  neutrophils  revealed  a  high  intensity  of &gt;10 2 indicating presence of phagocytic burst activity.

Fig. 2 Flow cytometry histogram plot showed R123 fluorescence results. 2(A) and 2(B) is unstimulated and PMA stimulated for normal healthy subjects while 2(C) and 2(D) is unstimulated and PMA stimulated for CML cases.

The DHR 123 flow cytometry in both CML group and healthy donor showed higher rhodamine fluorescence with  stimulation  by  PMA.  On  comparing  the  MFI values between CML patients and healthy donors, it

revealed CML patients have statistically significant lower  MFI  compared  to  healthy  donor  (312.15  vs 738.22;  p&lt;0.05)  which  reflects  poorer  respiratory burst activity. (Table -1).

In  figure-3,  Box  and  Whisker  Plots  showed  the median MFI values for PMA stimulated neutrophils in CML subjects were statistically significantly lower than control healthy subjects(p&lt;0.05).

## NBT test results

NBT assay took an average of four hours to complete. NBT positive cells in PMA stimulated samples and NBT  negative  cells  in  unstimulated  samples  were shown in Figure 4A and 4B respectively. In figure

Fig. 3 Box and Whisker Plots showed MFI for PMA stimulated CML group and healthy donor. Horizontal line  indicates  median  MFI  value.  Median  MFI  for CML  case  was  significantly  lower  than  healthy person.

In this study, the DHR flowcytometry assay and NBT test  results  showed  good  agreement  in  terms  of  positive and negative results  in  simulated  and  unstimulated cells  respectively  but  with  poor  correlation  in  the percentage  values  (r  =  0.066,  p=0.723).   Although there  was  poor  correlation  between  the  percentage of  stimulated  cells  in  the  two  methods,  the  study revealed that the percentage value of stimulated cells

in flow cytometry were higher than the NBT (98.06% vs 87.5%) (Table 2). This study also showed that all unstimulated samples of normal healthy participants and  CML  patients  showed  negative  results  for  the NBT which  were  in  accordance  with  the  negative result  in  flowcytometry.  Similarly,  the  stimulated cells showed positive results which agrees between the two tests.

## Discussion

This present study showed that the DHR 123 flow cytometry assay was simple, quick and easy method that takes only 1 hour compared to the NBT test that takes 4 hours. Previous studies also showed DHR 123 flow cytometry assay has several potential technical advantages. Blood sample required for analysis is as small as 0.1 ml making this assay ideal for studies especially in neonate and young children which is the most common age group investigated for CGD and haematological malignancy. 5,6,13

On the other hand, the conventional NBT test required skillful  personal  to  interpret  the  findings  which  include visual inspection of the peripheral blood neutrophils and therefore very much dependent on the observer experience. 12,20 The  limitations  of  the  NBT  test  has been shown in many studies regarding the artifactual changes  that  can  occur  following  cells  isolation procedures that potentially activate neutrophils leading to false negative results. 13,21 Therefore, it is important to maintain the physiological environment

in  order  to  preserve  the  normal  functional  state  of cells during  laboratory  testing. 13 Other  technical factors  that  affect  the  results  in  the  NBT  test  are concentration of heparin and NBT, duration of blood stored  before  the  assay  and  temperature  of  bloodNBT  mixture  incubation  and  many  others. 12,20,22,23 These explain many discrepancies on the NBT test results between different institutions. There are also unstandardized  ways  of  interpreting  the  NBT  test specially  to  identify  and  counting  the  neutrophils with positive and negative result leading to different normal ranges used in different laboratories. 19,22

Flow  cytometry  has  the  ability  to  measure  multiple functions of neutrophils simultaneously, for example the measurement of the geomean and the MFI which provide  added  information  on  the  degree  of  the phagoburst activity of the neutrophil as compared with the conventional NBT. This present study showed that the DHR flow cytometry assay can clearly distinguish between unstimulated and PMA stimulated neutrophils as described by previous studies. 16,24

In comparison between the CML patients and normal healthy  individuals,  our  study  revealed  that  CML patients  showed  statistically  significant  lower  MFI compared to the healthy adults ( 312.15 and 738.22 respectively, p&lt;0.05), which implies that despite the normal neutrophils count of the CML patients, they have  poorer  activity  compared  to  normal  patients. Usually CML patient with positive BCR-ABL fusion protein  have  defective  neutrophils  function. 10 One recent study showed median MFI in CGD patients and normal controls were 432.5 and 902.5 respectively suggesting  this  method  as  a  cost-effective  tool  for effective  diagnosis  of  primary  immune  deficiency (PID) disorders. 25 Although genetic analysis is needed for definitive diagnosis of such diseases, this method adds an advantage by giving an alternative option for screening  of  suspected  Primary  Immunodeficiency diseases  in  haematological  laboratories  equipped with flow cytometer. 26

Comparison between the two test methods showed there is poor  statistical correlation between  the percentage  of  PMA  stimulated  cells  in  DHR  assay and the NBT test (r = 0.066, p=0.723). In a previous study on comparison  between  the  DHR  assays and  NBT test  showed  a  high  degree  of  correlation between these two tests. They conclude that whole blood  DHR  assay  is  an  accurate  and  sensitive measure of respiratory burst.  Our study supports this 5 fact that although there was poor correlation between the percentages of NBT  stimulated cells with percentage of DHR positive cells, the percentage of stimulated cells in flow cytometry method is higher than  the  NBT  test.  All  of  the  DHR  flow  samples showed  percentage  stimulated  cells  of  more  than 95% suggesting  the  higher  sensitivity .  All  samples with negative NBT showed negative DHR, reflecting high  degree  of  agreement  between  these  two  tests and eliminating possible false negative result. These findings suggested that the DHR flow cytometry has more technical superiority for detection of phagoburst activity in the neutrophils.

## Conclusion

DHR  flow  cytometry  showed  higher  fluorescence intensity in PMA stimulated neutrophils. It showed statistically  significant  lower  MFI  in  CML  patients

compared to healthy donor, reflecting poorer respiratory  burst  activity  that  coincides  with  the disease process of CML. The percentage of stimulated cells  in  flow  cytometry  were  higher  than  the  NBT (98.06%  vs  87.5%),  although  it  showed  a  poor correlation between two methods. Despite that, there is a good agreement between NBT test and the DHR 123 flow cytometry assay in terms of positive and negative results in simulated and unstimulated cells. In flow cytometry, presence of &gt;95% of stimulated cells suggest the higher sensitivity. All samples with negative  NBT  showed  negative  DHR,  reflecting high  degree  of  agreement  between  these  two  tests and eliminating possible false negative result. Thus, DHR  flow  cytometry  test  is  a  quick,  simple  and easy method, has superior technical advantages and able  to  provide  further  information  on  the  degree of phagoburst activity from the Geomean and MFI data. The flow cytometry methods thus represent a convenient  alternative  to  the  classical  methods  for measurement of neutrophils respiratory burst.
