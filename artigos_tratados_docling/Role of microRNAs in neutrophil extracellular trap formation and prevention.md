## A B S T R A C T

Active neutrophils play a variety of roles in both innate and adaptive immune responses, and one of the most vital roles is the formation and release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). NETs are created when neutrophils release their chromatin contents to get and eradicate pathogenic organisms essentially. While NET helps fight bacteria, viruses, parasites, and infections, it is also linked to asthma, atherosclerosis, and cancer metastasis. Thus,  understanding  the  molecular  mechanisms  behind  NETosis  formation  and  its  inhibition  is  crucial  for developing safe and effective therapies.

This systematic review aims to identify the list of miRNAs that are associated with the formation of NETosis and illustrate the mechanism of action by classifying them based on their expression site. Moreover, it summarizes the list of miRNAs that can be targeted therapeutically to reduce NETosis in various disorders.

The current study entailed the searching of PubMed and Google Scholar for articles related to the research topic  role  of  miRNAs  in  NETosis  in  all  types  of  disorders.  The  search  terms  and  phrases  included ' NETs, ' ' neutrophil extracellular traps, '  ' NETosis, '  ' miRNA, '  ' miR, ' and ' micro-RNA. ' The search was limited to articles published in English since October 2024 in both databases.

Following a review of 23 papers, 19 of them met the inclusion and exclusion criteria of this study. Four papers have been removed as they are duplicated or do not meet our criteria. According to the published articles till October 2024, there are 14 miRNAs involved in the molecular pathway of NETosis which are miR-155, miR1696, miR-7, miR-223, miR-146a, miR-142a-3p, miR-3146, miR-505, miR-4512, miR-15b-5p, miR-16-5p, miR26b-5p, miR-125a-3p and miR-378a-3p. Moreover, eight miRNAs have been identified as possible therapeutic targets for the suppression of NETosis based on in-vivo studies carried out in various organisms, which are miR155, miR-146a, miR-1696, miR-223, miR-142a-3p, miR-3146, miR-4512, miR-16-5p. Different miRNAs that are expressed inside or outside of neutrophils can regulate and influence NETosis. Eight miRNAs have also been identified as potential therapeutic targets, which can be utilized to inhibit the molecular pathways associated with NETosis and prevent its negative effects, such as asthma, atherosclerosis, cancer metastasis, and cancer recurrence. However, further human-based research is necessary to completely understand the role of miRNAs in the development of NETosis in humans.

## 1. Introduction

Neutrophils are terminally developed white blood cells produced in humans at a rate of 5 × 10 10 -10 × 10 10 cells/day [1]. In circulation, neutrophils can survive for 6 -8 h, while their life span is much longer after  infiltrating  the  tissue  [1].  Inflammatory  stimuli  encourage  neutrophils to leave the circulation and move to the site of infection, where they  can  quickly  kill  pathogens  through  phagocytosis  [2],  or  by  the release of their potent antimicrobial arsenal, which includes granular enzymes and proteins, oxidants such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) [3], as well as neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) [4].

Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are large, extracellular, weblike structures that were discovered in 2004 [4]. NETs consist of cytosolic and granule proteins that are arranged on a framework of decondensed chromatin [5]. While most of the DNA found in NETs is derived from the nucleus, these structures include mitochondrial DNA [6]. NETs have several roles in the body, such as trapping and neutralizing bacteria [4], fungi [7], viruses [8] and parasites [9] and have been shown to inhibit  the  spread  of  bacteria  and  fungi  [10].  This  phenomenon  is considered as a relatively new innate immune response to infections [11].

However,  if  not  properly  regulated,  NETs  can  play  a  role  in  the development  of  immune-related  disorders  such  as  cancer  metastasis [12 15], autoimmune diseases [16,17], chronic airway inflammatory -diseases  [18],  thrombotic  diseases  [19],  rheumatoid  arthritis  [20], Diabetes [6], cystic fibrosis [21], systemic lupus erythematosus [22], psoriasis [23], periodontitis [24], vasculitis [25], coagulation disorders [26], and atherosclerosis [27,28]. Therefore, researchers have considered targeting NETs, either directly or indirectly, as a crucial therapeutic approach  [29].  The  direct  target  of  NET  can  be  achieved  by  using different compounds, such as DNase, to degrade the web [30]. On the other hand, the indirect approach targets the molecules involved in the NETosis, such as the protein arginine deiminase 4 (PAD4) enzyme and an  arginine-to-citrulline  converter,  which  play  a  role  in  chromatin condensation and NETosis [31]. For example, inhibition of ROS, PAD4, NO/NOS, and Gasdermin D has demonstrated a reduction in NETosis and advancement of the disease [31].

Furthermore, using these techniques may not always be safe and could  potentially lead to additional complications. For instance, applying some inhibitors could result in the complete suppression of neutrophil function, hence providing an opportunity for infection [29]. Thus,  there  is  still  a  need  for  additional  studies  to  understand  the pathways involved in NETosis and how to block it for medicinal purposes. Therefore, it is essential to look for new factors that might influence  the  formation  of  NETosis  in  order  to  get  a  comprehensive understanding of this process and develop treatment strategies to combat  it.  Several  studies  have  examined  the  significance  of  microRNAs (miRNAs) as significant regulators of  the process of  NETosis,  among other potential factors [32]. miRNAs are diminutive non-coding RNAs that play a crucial role in regulating nearly all physiological processes in both animals and plants, as well as they are implicated in the progression of various diseases [33]. Moreover, in recent years, miRNAs have been utilized as a potential therapeutic target in treating various illnesses, such as cancer [34,35], by targeting different approaches such as CRISPR/Cas9 [36,37]and miRNA mimics [38].

In  this  systematic  narrative  review,  we  aim  to  identify  the  list  of miRNAs that play in the formation of NETosis. In addition to that, we categorized them according to the mechanism, site of secretion, and role in the process of NETosis. Finally, miRNAs with the potential to be used as therapeutic targets to prevent the formation of NETosis have been identified.

## 2. Methodology

Data  has  been  collected  and  assessed  according  to  the  Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA)

instructions  in  2020  (Fig.  1)  [39].  Prior  to  conducting  the  literature search, all members of the review panel unanimously endorsed the study procedure.

## 2.1. Literature search

A comprehensive literature search conducted across various databases has been systematically performed to identify the literature that illustrated the role of miRNAs in the formation and inhibition of NETs in various types of diseases. This topic was searched electronically on two platforms: PubMed (9 hits) and Google Scholar (9 hits), in addition to looking at the citations of the published papers under the same topics. The keywords used in the investigation are ' NETs, ' ' neutrophil extracellular traps, ' ' NETosis, ' ' miRNA, ' ' miR, ' and ' micro-RNA. ' Furthermore,  the  papers  identified  through  these  database  searches were assessed according to their titles and abstracts, and only those that fulfilled the inclusion criteria were taken into consideration. The search and evaluations were completed by October 2024.

## 2.2. Study selection

We examined the role of miRNAs in the formation, inhibition, and communication  of  NETosis  in  verities  of  diseases  that  examined  in various  types  of  animals  and  cell  lines.  Moreover,  in  this  systematic review, studies published in English since October 2024 were included.

On the other hand, review articles, conference abstracts, editorials, letters, correspondence, perspective, posters, and bioinformatics studies were all excluded. Furthermore, duplicate papers were eliminated. All authors independently participated in screening, evaluating, and data extraction.

## 3. Data extraction

The data obtained from the 17 studies included in this systematic review have been summarized and categorized into five different tables. These tables are classified based on the location of miRNA expression and their  target  sites,  namely  whether  it  is  within  or  outside  of  the neutrophils.

## 4. Results

## 4.1. Result overview

A total of 17 studies have been conducted to investigate the role of miRNAs in the regulation of NETosis. According to our systematic review, the first study that reveals the involvement of miRNAs in NETosis was  published  in  2019.  Altogether,  16  miRNAs  play  a  role,  either directly or indirectly, in the process of NETosis. Among them, 8 miRNAs are expressed within neutrophils, while the remaining 5 are expressed in other  cells  and  induce  the  formation  of  NETs.  Additionally,  to  date, several inhibitors have successfully targeted nine different miRNAs to inhibit the formation of NETosis. Regarding the study types, most of them were performed in vivo ,  with mice being involved in 7 of these studies.  However,  four in  vitro studies  have  been  performed  using various cell lines.

## 4.2. miRNAs expressed inside neutrophils that regulate NETosis

As previously mentioned, miRNAs directly contribute to the control of  numerous molecular pathways both in  vivo and in  vitro .  Here,  according to our systematic review, eight studies examine the role of 8 different miRNAs in the regulation of NETosis inside the neutrophils, which are miR-155, miR-155-5p, miR-146a, miR-1696, miR-7, miR-223, miR-3146, miR-16-5p (Table 1). Moreover, based on our findings, there are 12 additional possible binding sites for these eight miRNAs inside neutrophils, which are PDA-4, TRAF6, IL-8, GPx3, TLR9, Smad2, SIRT1,

PiK3R1, IL-1 ß ,  TNFα ,  TGFβ 1,  and  RAF1.  Furthermore,  our  comprehensive study demonstrates that these miRNAs ' modulation of NETosis is  linked  to  several  human  disorders,  including  diffuse  alveolar  haemorrhage, interstitial lung diseases, acute liver failure, and gout flare (Table 1).

## 4.3. NET-miRNAs: as a module of communication between NET and other cells

Our review indicates that NET communicates with other cells in its environment via a variety of miRNAs that are expressed upon NETosis. Here, in (Table 2), we summarized the list of miRNAs that are released during  NETosis  and  target  various  cells.  The  main  miRNAs  that  are considered  NET-miRNAs  are  miRNA-142-3p,  which  targets  macrophages, and miR-17/92 cluster, which targets monocytes.

## 4.4. miRNAs expressed in other cells in response to the NETosis

NET development may be related to changes in the expression levels of  different  miRNAs in neighbouring cells (Table 3). According to Li et al. (2022), treating AGS with the NET can change the expression of

315 miRNAs, 134 lncRNAs, and 1083 mRNAs (Table 3) [51].

## 4.5. Exosomal miRNAs target the neutrophil nucleus to control NETosis

Our systematic review reveals that, in addition to miRNAs synthesized by neutrophils to regulate NETosis, there is a list of miRNAs synthesized by other cells that target neutrophil genes in the regulation of NETosis  (Table  4).  Exosomal  miRNAs  have  been  identified  in  four separate studies. Based on these four studies, it has been found that five various microRNAs are secreted by five different kinds of cells in order to regulate NETosis. miR-142a-3p, miR-15b-5p, miR-378a-3p, miR-505, miR-4512,  and  miR-125a-3p  are  the  main  miRNAs  that  have  been discovered.  The  main  cell  types  involved  in  secreting  these  miRNAs through exosomes to regulate the NETosis process are liver cells, macrophages, monocytes, platelets, and endothelial cells (Table 4). Furthermore, the upregulation of these miRNAs and the induction of NETosis are linked to a range of diseases, including Schistosomiasis, atherosclerosis, Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, and sepsis. For example, extracellular  vesicles  (EVs)  excreted  from  the  liver  of  Schistosoma japonicum-infected mice (IL-EVs) encourage NET release by delivering miR-142a-3p to target WASL and block the progression of S. japonicum

## 4.6. Targeting miRNAs inside neutrophils as an opportunity to prevent NETosis

Through our comprehensive analysis, we have identified eight specific  miRNAs  that  have  the  potential  to  be  utilized  as  targets  for

inhibiting the progression of NETosis (Table 5). According to our findings,  NETosis can be avoided by targeting miR-155, miR-146a, miR1696,  miR-223,  miR-142a-3p,  miR-3146,  miR-4512,  and  miR-16-5p. Additionally,  antagomir,  miRNA-mimic,  and  CRISPR/Cas  technology are the primary methods that can be used for the inhibition of NETosis. Furthermore, Yin et al. (2010) found that H2S can also target the miR16-5p and prevent the development of NETosis [46].

## 5. Discussion

According to our systematic review, miRNAs play a very significant role  in  the  stimulation  and  inhibition  of  various  cellular  activities, including NETosis. miRNAs have a significant impact on these processes by targeting various mRNA sites inside the neutrophils (Table 1) (Fig. 2). According to those studies that were screened and analysed by our team, there are eight miRNAs that target 16 genes, which are PAD-4, TRAF6, IL-8, TLR9, Smad2, GPx3, WASL, SIRT1, SIRT3, CXCL2, PiK3R1, RAF1, IL-1 ß , TNFα , TGFβ 1 and PDKA1. miRNAs, by negatively regulating the expression  of  various  genes,  act  as  tiny  guide  molecules  in  RNA, silencing the levels of mRNAs and proteins by degrading their mRNA target and/or by silencing translation [59].

Moreover,  according  to  papers  summarized  in  Table  4,  miRNAs involved in NET regulation are not only expressed within neutrophils, but they may also be released by other cells and transported through exosomes  in  the  bloodstream  to  interact  with  neutrophils  (Table  4). Moreover, Exosomal miRNAs that are expressed in normal diseases play important roles in the biological functions [60]. For example, macrophages can produce and release miRNA-142-3p, target the neutrophils, and  downregulate  the  formation  of  NETosis  by  inhibiting  TNFα in macrophages [49]. For instance, liver cells can produce miR-142a-3p, which later target WASL genes and influence the formation of NETosis

[52]. Their role for miRNAs that have distance targets has been noticed in other diseases, such as cancer [61]. On the other hand, during and after NETosis, neutrophils express various miRNAs that target other cells differently  than  neutrophils  and  are  called  NET-miRNAs  (Table  2) (Fig.  2).  For  instance,  miR-3158-5p  excreted  by  the  neutrophils  and target RAB3B gene in AGS cells [51]. Furthermore, additional research is recommended to discover the influence of NETosis on other immune cells and organs, particularly through the expression of miRNAs.

Another important point that we have figured out during this systematic review is some of the miRNAs can be targeted for preventing the formation of NETosis in various diseases (Table 5). According to these studies  summarized  in  Table  5,  targeting  miR-155,  miR-146a,  miR1696,  miR-223,  miR-142a-3p,  miR-3146,  miR-4512,  and  miR-16-5p can be beneficial for  inhibiting  the  formation  of  NETosis.  Moreover, targeting these miRNAs can be performed by various approaches. For example, antigomiR is one of the reliable and precise molecules that can be performed for targeting various miRNAs in vivo and in vitro [62]. For example,  antagomiR-155-5p  or  ctrl-antagomiR-155  can  be  used  for inhibiting  the  formation  of  NETosis  in  mice  by  binding  miR-155.  In Addition,  miR-155  plays  a  significant  role  in  cancer  metastasis  by directly or indirectly targeting genes related to epithelial-mesenchymal transition, migration, and invasion, particularly in colon, renal, pancreatic cancers, and leukemia [63 -65]. However, targeting miR-155 in  neutrophils  and  its  potential  positive  impact  on  cancer  initiation, progression  and  metastasis,  should  be  further  investigated  in  future studies. For further functional studies, CRISPR/Cas, on the other hand, can be specifically used for investigating the role of specific miRNAs and genes by knocking out of them at the level of gene. Moreover, there are few challenges that should be considered while trying to target miRNAs by CRISPR/Cas such as lacking Cas9 PAM, short sequence of miRNA, off-targeting and selecting proper delivery methods especially in  vivo study [37]. However, In our previous review article, we recommended strategies  to  overcome  these  challenges [37]. As summarized before, Exosomal miRNAs can successfully circulate inside the blood and target the neutrophil nucleus (Tables 2 and 4); thus, using Exosomal miRNAs can be an effective approach for targeting genes that are associated with the formation of NETosis.

Nevertheless,  none of  these  experiments  have  been  conducted  on humans or human primary cells in this research. Therefore, it is advisable to utilize 3D organoid modules that properly replicate the human physiological situation as initial trial experiments. Several approaches, such as the organ-chip module, can be employed in vitro to replicate laboratory conditions and simulate human circulation for immune cells [66].

## 6. Conclusion

In conclusion, based on our analysis of several studies on the role of miRNAs in NETosis, we have summarized that different miRNAs have a significant impact on this process by either suppressing or stimulating specific  molecular  pathways.  Our  search  has  identified  a  total  of  12

miRNAs that are associated with NETosis. However, it is important to note that not all miRNAs are expressed exclusively within neutrophils. Certain miRNAs can also be expressed in other cells, such as monocytes, liver cells, and epithelial cells. Thirdly, miRNAs have the potential to serve  as  a  therapeutic  target  for  inhibiting  NETosis,  and  so  limiting several clinical diseases. In addition, the prevention of NETosis has been shown by targeting certain microRNAs, including miR-155, miR-146a, miR-1696, miR-223, miR-142a-3p, miR-3146, miR-4512, and miR-165p, in different animal models such as mice and chickens. Finally, the primary limitations identified in this systematic review are a lack of studies  focused  on  human  physiology.  Therefore,  it  is  highly  recommended to conduct additional research using human organoids-on-chip or other 3D models that faithfully replicate human physiology.
