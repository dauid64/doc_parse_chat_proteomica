Human peripheral blood monocytes and neutrophils secrete TGF-beta. Activation of  monocytes with  LPS stimulates the secretion of TGF-beta;  however,  the production of TGF-beta by neutrophils  was not altered by treatment with LPS. The secreted TGF-beta appears to be in a fully active form since acid treatment of the conditioned  medium does not increase the  amount of TGF-beta activity. TGFbeta 1 transcripts  were detected at similar  levels in both activated and nonactivated  monocytes and  neutrophils,  suggesting that  the  increase in TGF-beta secretion  after activation of monocytes  is  regulated by  a posttranscriptional mechanism. Western  blot analysis with anti-N-terminal TGF-beta 1 peptide antibodies indicate the leukocyte-derived TGF-beta is beta 1. In addition,  TGF-beta 1 transcripts were detected in rat peritoneal macrophages and in a differentiating human hematopoietic  tumor  cell  line  (HEL). The  ability  of  inflammatory cells such as  monocytes and neutrophils to produce TGF-beta may play an important role in the function of these cells in wound repair, in the immune response, and in the pathogenesis of fibrotic  diseases

Transforming  growth  factor-beta (TGF-beta)  was initially characterized by its ability to induce anchorage-independent growth of nontransformed  fibroblasts (DeLarco and Todaro, 1978).  More recent studies have demonstrated that this same polypeptide  can  elicit a variety of responses in target cells. For example, TGFbeta has since been shown to stimulate mesenchymal cell growth (Leof et al., 1986) and to be a potent inhibitor of  epithelial (Tucker et al., 1984) and endothelial cell growth (Baird and Durkin, 1986; Frater-Schroder et al., 1986; Heimark et al., 1986; Muller  et al., 1987; Takahara et al.,  1987). Additionally,  TGF-beta is believed  to  regulate  the  differentiation  of several  cell types (Ignotz and Massague, 1985; Masui et al., 1986; Massague et al., 1986) and may also play a role in the induction of mesoderm during embryonic development (Heine et al.,  1987; Kimelman  and Kirschner,  1987; Rosa et al., 1988).

Because this peptide factor appears to play a key role in  the  regulation  of  growth  and  differentiation  in  a variety  of  biological  systems it  will  be  important to identify the cellular sources of TGF-beta and to understand what factors regulate its synthesis and secretion. Past  studies have  indicated  that the most  abundant source  of  TGF-beta  is  platelets,  although  it  is  also present in other tissues and is synthesized by a variety of transformed  and  nontransformed  cells (review: Sporn  et  al.,  1987).  TGF-beta  isolated  from  human platelets is a 25 kD homodimer  composed of disulfidelinked  12.5 kD  peptides  (Assoian et  al.,  1983). It  is released from platelets in a latent form which requires treatment with  urea  or  acid  in vitro to  achieve  full activity  (Pircher et al., 1986). Studies by Lyons  et al. (1988) have indicated that this activation is dependent

on proteolytic  activity although the actual mechanism of activation remains  unclear.  At  present  there  are three forms  of  TGF-beta  (1, 2, and 3) which  exhibit 70-80%  homology in amino acid sequence and are encoded by three distinct genes (Cheifetz et al., 1987; ten Dijke et al., 1988; Derynck et al., 1988).

In addition to platelets other inflammatory cells are potential sources of TGF-beta in vivo. TGF-beta is produced by  PHA activated T lymphocytes  (Kehrl et al., 1986) and activated human alveolar macrophages and peripheral blood  monocytes  (Assoian et al., 1987). In order  to  extend these studies we  have compared t h e production of TGF-beta by peripheral blood neutrophils and monocytes. Our findings indicate that both monocytes and neutrophils secrete  a form of TGF-beta which does not require acid treatment for activation. The secretion of the TGF-beta activity is stimulated in monocytes  by  agents  which  activate  these  cells  such  as endotoxin,F-metpeptides, or  immune  complexes,whereas the level of secretion by neutrophils is high in nonactivated cells and is not altered by  activating agents. Both cell types express the TGF-beta  1  gene constitutively and secrete a TGF-beta molecule which is structurally  similar to  that  released  by  human  platelets. These  data  indicate that  in  addition  to  other  leukocytes,  neutrophils  express  the  TGF-beta  1 gene  and secrete a high  level of TGF-beta activity.

## MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell culture

Human peripheral blood monocytes and neutrophils were isolated from  whole  blood  by centrifugation through a Hypaque-Ficoll gradient. Venous blood was collected  in  acid-citrate dextrose  and  each  30  ml  of blood was layered over a 20 ml solution of Ficoll-Hypaque  and  centrifuged  at  500g  for 30 minutes. The mononuclear and granulocyte layers were removed by aspiration with  a plastic pasteur pipet  and the cells were diluted with DMEM containing 2 mg/ml BSA and plated at a density of lo6 cells/ml. The cells were allowed to incubate 2 hours and attach to the plate and the medium was changed to eliminate any nonadherent  cells  such  as red  blood  cells,  lymphocytes,  and platelets. Conditioned medium was collected  16 hours later.

Peritoneal  macrophages were obtained from SpragueDawley rats as described below. The animals were injected intraperitoneally with 4% thioglycolate and the peritoneal exudate was collected 3 days later by lavage with  phosphate-buffered  saline  (PBS).  Macrophages were  recovered  from  the  exudate  by  centrifugation. HEL and NRK cells were obtained from the American Type  Culture  Collection,  Rockville,  MD  and  maintained in culture in DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were cultured at 37°C in an atmosphere of 90% air 10% COZ. The cultures were passaged weekly at a split ratio of  1:20.

## Conditioned medium

For anchorage-independent  growth assays, the conditioned medium was acid treated by lowering the pH to 2 with the addition of  1  N  HC1. After  1  hour on ice the sample was neutralized by using 5 N NaOH. The sample was dialyzed  against  15 mM  Hepes,  pH  7.4. Conditioned medium that had not been acid activated was used as the neutral sample and was similarly dialyzed. The dialyzed samples were lyophilized and reconstituted  in one-tenth the original volume in water. Conditioned  medium  was also assayed  directly, without prior dialysis  or concentration. Neutral platelet extracts were prepared by extracting frozen platelet pellets with 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, and homogenized with a Polytron. The extracts were centrifuged at 10,OOOg for 30  minutes  and  the  supernatants  were stored at -20°C. Acid  activation  was  performed  as described above.

For Western blot analysis aliquots  of conditioned medium were prepared for  electrophoresis  on polyacrylamide  gels.  Aliquots  of conditioned medium  were treated by dialysis against 0.1 N acetic acid. They were lyophilized and dissolved in sample buffer. Some samples were reduced with dithiothreitol.

## Anchorage-independent growth assay

TGF-beta activity was assayed by the ability to stimulate  anchorage-independent  growth  of  NRK  cells in soft  agar.  A  bottom  layer of  300  kl  of  0.5% agar in DMEM and 10%  FCS was plated in 16 mm wells of a 24-well culture dish (Corning). To the hardened bottom agar was  added  500 pl of  0.35% agar in DMEM and 10%  FCS. The top agar solution also contained EGF (10

ng/ml), PDGF  (10 ng/ml), and  10,000 NRK  cells/ml. Eighty  microliters  of  the  samples  to  be  tested  were added on top of the hardened top agar. The plates were incubated 7 days and then stained with p-iodonitrotetrazolium violet (50 pg/ml final  concentration).  Colonies larger than 50 p.m2  were counted with an image analyzer.

Anchorage-independent  growth was  also measured by 3H-thymidine incorporation of NRK cells growing in methylcellulose.  The  methylcellulose  (1.2% w/v) was prepared in DMEM, 10%  FCS under sterile conditions. Aliquots  of  400  pl  were  added  to  1 1  mm  wells  of  a 48-well culture dish (Costar). Each well then received 80,000 cells, PDGF, and EGF to give a final concentration of  10 ng/ml  each,  and 40  p1 of  the sample to be tested,  After  a  5-day  incubation, 3H-thymidine  was added to a final concentration of 3 FCi/ml and the cells were incubated an additional 24 hours. The methylcellulose was then transferred to Eppendorf tubes and diluted with at least 2 volumes of  PBS. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation and washed twice with PBS. DNA synthesis was determined from the incorporation of 3H-thymidine into TCA-precipitable material.

## Western blot analysis

Conditioned medium was prepared for Western blot analysis as described above. Aliquots were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 15% acrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose  by  electrophoretic  blotting.  The  blots were preincubated for 4 hours in Tris buffered  saline (100 mM  NaC1, 50 mM Tris pH 7.4) with 2.5 mgiml instant nonfat powdered milk (TBS-milk). Blots were then  incubated  overnight,  at  room  temperature,  in TBS-milk with anti-TGF-beta IgG at a 1:lOO dilution. The  antibody  was  a  rabbit  polyclonal  antibody  prepared against a synthetic  peptide of the 30 N-terminal amino acids of  human platelet  TGF-beta.  The filters were washed three times, 5 minutes each, in TBS-milk and incubated  with  alkaline phosphatase conjugated goat antirabbit IgG (Cappel). The incubation of the second antibody was at a 1:1,000 dilution in TBS-milk for 90 minutes. The filters were washed three times with TBS-milk  followed  by  two  washes  in  TBS,  and  the Western blot was developed by using the alkaline phosphatase substrate kit supplied by KPL (Gaithersburg, MD) .

## Nothern blot analysis

Total  RNA  was  prepared  from  cells  by  extraction with guanidinium isothiocyanate (Chirgwin,  1979).  Aliquots of  total RNA were electrophoresed on 1.5% formaldehyde-agarose  gels. The RNA was plotted  to  nitrocellulose (Thomas, 1980)  and  hybridized with 32P-labeled  probe  in  standard hybridization  buffer  at 39°C. The probe was a  1.0 kb Nar I  fragment of  the human TGF-beta 1  c DNA (provided by Graeme Bell, Howard  Hughes  Institute,  University  of Chicago) which  was  labeled  by  the  random  primer  labeling method (Boehringer  Mannheim).  The  filters  were washed  at room  temperature  in 2 x   SSC, 0.1% SDS followed by washing in 0.1 x  SSC,  0.1% SDS at  42°C for 30 minutes. Filters were exposed to Kodak x-ray film in the presence of an intensifying screen for 1-3  days.

## RESULTS Activated human peripheral blood monocytes secrete TGF-beta

Conditioned  medium  from  human peripheral blood monocytes was tested for the ability to induce anchorage-independent  growth of normal rat kidney  (NRK) fibroblasts. This assay, which is a measure of TGF-beta activity (DeLarco and Todaro, 1978),  was performed in the presence of PDGF and EGF to elicit optimal colony formation  (Assoian et al., 1984). Conditioned  medium from nonstimulated monocytes (24-hour collection) induced  the formation  of  colonies  above that seen with PDGF and EGF alone (Fig. 1). However,  conditioned medium  from  LPS-stimulated monocytes  (24 hours)

The assays were performed as described in Materials and Methods and medium prepared as in Figure 1.  Colonies were counted with a Zeiss image analysis system as described in Materials and Methods. Acid  treatment of  platelet  extracts (pH 2 ) stimulated  a  tenfold  increase in the number of colonies formed,  whereas similar  treatment of medium conditioned by  either nonactivated or activated monocytes did not  increase the amount of  TGF-beta activated in the medium. The data represent the average of  duplicate determinations.

contained higher levels of TGF-beta activity, indicated by the formation of numerous large colonies (Fig. Id). Quantitation  of  the  colonies  by  image  analysis  revealed  the  activity  in  medium  from  LPS  activated monocytes  is four-  to fivefold  higher  than  that  from nonactivated monocytes (Fig. 2).

Since the TGF-beta stored in platelets (Pircher  et al., 1986)  and that synthesized by transformed cells (Kryceve-Martinerie et al., 1985) or fibroblasts (Lawrence  et al., 1984) appears to be in a latent form, we examined the monocyte TGF-beta to see if it also was secreted in a latent form. The latent TGF-beta can be activated in vit,ro  by exposure to acid pH. The pH of the monocyte-conditioned medium was lowered to 2 with HC1, neutralized, and tested in the anchorage-independent assay. There was no increase in activity; rather, a slight decrease was observed which might be due to a slight loss of  activity through manipulation (Figs. le, 2). Extracts prepared from platelets and tested as neutral  or  acid-activated  preparations  exhibited  the  expected  increase in  activity (Fig. 2).  The  secretion  of fully active TGF-beta  is not limited  to human monocytes as rat peritoneal macrophages also secrete a fully active form of TGF-beta (Table 1). hese data indicate T that activated monocytes secrete a fully active form of TGF-beta.

While the colony formation of NRK cells in soft agar correlates with the concentration of TGF-beta present, quantifying the number of  colonies  requires an arbitrary  cutoff  of  colonies  smaller than  a  set limit. We have developed an assay in which all NRK cells stimulated to divide by TGF-beta are included in the quantitation. Here proliferation  of  NRK  cells is measured by the 3H-thymidine incorporation of cells growing in a semisolid  medium  containing  1.2% wiv  methylcellulose. Comparison of the colony formation vs. 3H-thymidine incorporation indicated  similar dose-response curves in these assays (Fig.  3A).  Using the standard  response  curve  generated  by  purified  human platelet TGF-beta, we quantitated the amount of TGF-

Monocytes join  a growing list of  inflammatory cell types which are capable of  secreting TGF-beta. In addition to being characterized  as a platelet peptide (Assoian et al., 19831,  TGF-beta has also been shown to be secreted  by lymphocytes (Kehrl  et  al., 1986).  We wanted to determine if yet another inflammatory cell, the neutrophil, was  also  capable  of  synthesizing and secreting TGF-beta.  Using the above 3H-thymidine  incorporation assay, we detected a high concentration (50 ngiml)  of  TGF-beta  activity  in  conditioned  medium from neutrophils (Fig. 3B). Unlike monocyte  derived TGF-beta, the amount of activity secreted was independent of treatment with LPS. The TGF-beta activity secreted by neutrophils is similar to the activity secreted by  monocytes,  as it  does  not  require  acid  activation (data not shown).

## Western blot analysis of monocyte TGF-beta

To  further  characterize  the  TGF-beta  activity  secreted by human peripheral blood monocytes and neutrophils,  conditioned  medium from the cells was subjected  to Western blot  analysis by using an antibody prepared against a  synthetic peptide  of  the 30 N-terminal amino acids of TGF-beta 1. A 25 kD peptide was detected  in  conditioned  medium  of  both  neutrophils and monocytes (Fig. 4.1. An increase in the amount of immunoreactive  peptide was seen in conditioned medium from LPS-activated  monocytes in comparison to nonactivated  monocytes. These peptides were  not  detected by nonimmune serum (data not shown). Reduction with dithiothreitol resulted in a shift to a 12.5 kD form in the monocyte TGF-beta (Fig. 4 ) . Thus, the neutrophils  and  monocytes  appear  to  secrete  TGF-beta

The filters were  washed as described  in the Materials  and Methods and exposed to x-ray film. The size of the transcript was determined by comparison to 285 and 18 s ribosomal RNA (not shown). Human erythroleukemia cells (HEL)  were treated with vehicle dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) (control),  phorbolmyristate acetateMA) (20 ngiml), or PMA (20 ngiml) and lipopolysaccharide  (LPS) (1  kgiml) for 24 hours in DMEM containing 10%  FCS prior to extraction of total RNA.

which is similar in structure to the TGF-beta 1  peptide released from platelets.

## Northern blot analysis of TGF-beta  gene expression in monocytes and neutrophils

We next examined the TGF-beta gene expression in human peripheral  blood  monocytes  and neutrophils. The increased secretion of TGF-beta observed upon activation of monocytes may be a result of an increase in gene expression. Such an induction in TGF-beta gene expression has been observed in other cells of hemopoietic origin. Human peripheral blood lymphocytes stimulated with PMA exhibit elevated steady-state levels of the 2.5 kb TGF-beta transcript over that in nonstimulated cells (Derynck et al., 1985).

To  investigate whether  a  similar  induction  occurs upon activation of human peripheral blood monocytes we performed Northern blot analysis of RNA from nonstimulated  and  LPS-stimulated  cells.  The  blot  was probed with a cDNA clone of human TGF-beta 1. A 2.5 kb transcript  was  detected in RNA from both stimulated  and  nonstimulated  cells  (Fig.  5). The  level  of TGF-beta  1  transcripts detected  in stimulated monocytes was decreased  somewhat from that in the nonstimulated monocytes. Therefore, the increased  secretion  of  TGF-beta  upon  activation  appears  to  be  the result  of  regulation  at  the  posttranscriptional level. When RNA prepared  from neutrophils was examined, using the same probe, a 2.5 kb transcript was also detected. As seen in the monocytes, treatment with LPS did not increase the level of TGF-beta 1  mRNA. Additionally, the expression of  the TGF-beta 1  gene is not

TGF-beta activity was determined by using the agar anchorage-independent growth assay as described in Materials and Methods. Conditioned medium was collected for 24 hours after the addition of  vehicle (DMSO), PMA (20 ngiml), or  PMA (20 ngiml) and LPS (1  pgiml). All conditioned media contained TGF-beta activity with the differentiated cells  exhibiting a  higher  level. The highest  level of  activity was secreted by  PMA-treated cells treated with LPS.

limited to human cells as isolated rat peritoneal  macrophages also contain TGF-beta 1 transcripts (Fig. 5).

## Expression of the TGF-beta 1 gene and secretion of TGF-beta by a differentiating hematopoietic cell line (HEL)

Because  numerous  bone-marrow-derived cells  express the TGF-beta  gene and secrete  TGF-beta peptides we wanted to investigate the expression of this gene in a differentiating  hematopoietic cell line. Previous studies have indicated  that U937  cells  express  the TGFbeta 1  gene and that the level of expression is independent of the differentiated  state of the cells (Assoian et al., 1987).  We examined the expression of the TGF-beta 1 gene  in  another  differentiating hematopoietic  cell line (HEL). As seen in Figure 5, the level of TGF-beta 1  transcripts present in HEL  cells  is independent of differentiation  with  phorbol  ester  or  activation  with phorbol ester and LPS. However, the amount of TGFbeta  activity  secreted  by  these  cells  is  increased  by phorbol ester treatment (Fig. 6). An even greater level of secretion is induced when cells are treated with both phorbol ester and LPS, suggesting that the HEL cells exhibit properties similar to those of human peripheral blood monocytes with respect to induction of TGF-beta secretion, although the level of induction is  much lower than that exhibited by the normal cells (Papayannopoulou et al., 1983).

## DISCUSSION

The data presented in this study demonstrate that both  peripheral blood  monocytes  and neutrophils secrete an active form of TGF-beta. Conditioned medium from  neutrophils and from  LPS-activated  monocytes stimulated the anchorage-independent  growth of NRK cells and could inhibit the growth of rat heart endothelial cells  (data not shown), both  of which  are characteristic of TGF-beta activity. A 25 kD immunoreactive peptide was detected in the conditioned medium by us-

ing an antibody  to  a  synthetic  peptide  which  corresponded to the N-terminal amino acid sequence of human TGF-beta  1, and analysis of total RNA prepared from human neutrophils and monocytes with a cDNA probe for the TGF-beta 1  mRNA revealed the presence of  transcripts in all cell types tested. No difference in the level of TGF-beta transcript was detected after activation  of  these  cells  with  either  LPS  or  FMLP.  In peripheral blood monocytes the secretion of TGF-beta was stimulated by  activation whereas in neutrophils the amount of release of the peptide was not altered by activation. These results indicate the regulation of secretion of TGF-beta by monocytes occurs by a posttranscriptional  mechanism.  In  contrast,  it  appears  that neutrophils may be releasing TGF-beta constitutively. We feel that this is unlikely, and while the cells did not express other activities which are characteristic of activation, such as  lysozyme production, it is still  possible that the cells are partially  activated by  the isolation procedure used and do not normally release the peptide in vivo in the circulation.

The constitutive TGF-beta  gene expression we  observed  in the  monocytes  and the LPS-stimulated secretion of  TGF-beta in these cells confirm the results reported previously by Assoian et al. (1987).  Additionally, monocytic cell lines such as U937 cells appear to also  exhibit  constitutive expression  of  the  TGF-beta gene  (Assoian et al.,  1987). Treatment of  U937  cells with phorbol  ester tumor  promoters  induced  a  macrophagelike phenotype but did not increase the level of expression of the TGF-beta  gene. We see a similar pattern  of TGF-beta  gene  expression  in  another  hematopoietic cell line, HEL cells. Induction of differentiation in these cells by treatment with TPA and LPS did not result in any increase in the level of TGF-beta transcripts although it did stimulate secretion of TGFbeta. Thus, the regulation of  TGF-beta production  by hematopoietic cells does not  appear to occur solely at the level of transcription. Because this gene appears to be  activated in  many  lineages of  bone  marrow  cells such as megakaryocytes, monocytes, and neutrophils it is possible  that  the  regulatory  events  which  control expression  of  the TGF-beta gene occur during an earlier stage of stem cell differentiation  than those which have been investigated.

In contrast to the results of Assoian et al. (1987),  our experiments indicate monocytes secrete a fully active form of TGF-beta.  We did not find any requirement for acid treatment of the conditioned medium for detection of  TGF-beta activity. TGF-beta stored in platelets requires acid treatment for full activity (Assoian et al., 1983;  Pircher et al., 1986).  Recent work by Lyons et al. (1988)  indicates that serine proteases may be involved in this activation and that this step may play a role in the amount of  TGF-beta activity present in vivo. The TGF-beta secreted by monocytes and by neutrophils in vitro appears to be completely processed,  possibly due to the presence  of  the appropriate serine protease  or other proteases,  as both of  these cell  types are abundant sources of  such enzymatic activities.

TGF-beta has been  demonstrated to  elicit  a broad spectrum of  responses  from  different  cell  types.  Because it can act as a potent growth stimulator as well as  growth  inhibitor  and  possible  differentiation inducer, the presence of TGF-beta in vivo is likely to be a

key element in the control of many biological processes. It is not  surprising that cell types such as monocytes and neutrophils which are central elements in both the immune response and tissue regeneration  and repair should be found to produce this peptide. TGF-beta inhibits the IL-2-dependent proliferation of lymphocytes, apparently by preventing up-regulation of IL-2 receptors (Kehrl et al., 1986).  Activated  lymphocytes themselves are also capable of producing TGF-beta (Kehrl  et al., 1986).  The production of  TGF-beta by the various leukocytes may function to limit the duration and extent of the immune response.

During  tissue  regeneration  and  repair  TGF-beta may  act  to  regulate  several  different processes.  Because neutrophils are  the most abundant of the inflammatory cells present during the first 72 hours of wound healing these cells may contribute the bulk of the total TGF-beta present during the early stages of the repair process. Additionally, peripheral blood monocytes, the progenitors of macrophages, are also a central cellular element  in  the  repair  process  (Leibovich  and  Ross, 1975). The presence  of  TGF-beta appears to be essential for normal connective tissue regeneration as a combination of  TGF-beta,  EGF, and PDGF could reverse the healing impairment  caused by  adriamycin treatment  whereas  individual factors  were  not  sufficient (Lawrence et  al.,  1986). Wound  fluid  collected  from these healing-impaired animals  contained  significantly lower levels of TGF-beta activity than fluid collected  from  normal-healing animals  (Grotendorst  et al.,  1988).

The precise function of TGF-beta in wound repair is not clear. In vitro studies have indicated  that TGF-beta stimulates the production  of  fibronectin  and collagen and increases the incorporation of these proteins into the extracellular matrix (Ignotz and Massague, 1986). Additionally, TGF-beta can stimulate the proliferation of fibroblastic cells in both anchorage-independent  and monolayer cultures, suggesting it may act to stimulate replication  of connective tissue cells and extracellular matrix synthesis. Although platelets are an abundant source of  TGF-beta, inflammatory cells such as blood monocytes  and neutrophils may produce  a significant amount of the TGF-beta  present during wound healing. We find high levels of TGF-beta transcripts present in total RNA isolated from regenerating connective tissue during the earliest stages of  the repair response  (unpublished  observations).  Since  platelets  lack  protein synthetic machinery it is most  likely that these transcripts  are  contained  in  leukocytes  present  at  the wound.
