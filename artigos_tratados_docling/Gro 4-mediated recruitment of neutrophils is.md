§

The factors mediating recruitment of immune T cells to challenge sites during contact hypersensitivity (CHS) responses remain unclear. To investigate the role of chemokines during elicitation of CHS, the temporal expression of chemokine genes in hapten-challenged ears was tested. KC (the murine homologoue of Gro ) was expressed 30 min following hapten challenge in naive and hapten-sensitized mice. A rabbit KC-specific antiserum inhibited elicitation of CHS when administered to sensitized mice prior to hapten challenge. Injecting either neutrophils or immune CD8 + T cells into the ear tissue of immune animals before hapten challenge circumvented the KC antiserum-mediated inhibition of CHS. Neutrophil depletion also inhibited CHS and was circumvented by injecting either neutrophils or hapten-primed CD8 + T cells into ears of sensitized mice followed by specific hapten challenge. These results indicate that KC-directed neutrophil infiltration of hapten challenge sites is required for elicitation of CHS and suggest that neutrophils mediate recruitment of the haptenspecific CD8 + T cells that subsequently produce cytokines mediating the hypersensitivity response.

## 1 Introduction

The elicitation of T cell-mediated responses in peripheral tissues is initiated by the recruitment of antigen-primed T cells to the site of antigen deposition. The presence of inflammation is clearly a key factor directing T cell recruitment to peripheral tissues [1, 2]. Contact hypersensitivity (CHS) is a T cell-mediated inflammatory response of the epidermis following skin challenge of hapten-sensitized animals [3, 4]. Challenge of sensitized animals induces the recruitment of hapten-primed T cells to the challenge site where they are stimulated to pro-

duce the cytokines mediating the characteristic edema of the response. Studies from several laboratories have indicated that CD8 + T cells are the primary effector cells of CHS [5-7]. The factors directing effector CD8 + T cell infiltration into the hapten challenge site during elicitation of CHS remain largely unknown.

Chemokines direct the trafficking of leukocytes to tissue sites of inflammation [8, 9]. The ability of chemokinespecific antibodies to inhibit leukocyte infiltration and tissue pathology in experimental models of inflammation has demonstrated the importance of chemokines in mediating leukocyte recruitment into inflammatory sites [10-12]. Previous results from this laboratory indicated the expression of several chemokine genes in the ear tissue of hapten-sensitized mice at the peak of the ear swelling response, 24 h after hapten challenge [13]. The role of chemokines in mediating T cell recruitment to the hapten challenge site, however, remains untested in the CHS response. The goal of the current study was to identify chemokines that were produced early following hapten challenge of sensitized mice and to test if neutralization of these chemokines would inhibit hapten-primed

CD8 + T cell recruitment to the challenge site during elicitation of CHS. The results indicate the T cellindependent production of the murine homologue of Gro , KC, by epidermal keratinocytes following hapten application and the key role of this chemokine in initiating elicitation of the CHS response. Effector CD8 + T cell recruitment to the hapten challenge site is not directly mediated by KC, however, but is indirectly mediated by neutrophils recruited to the site by the keratinocyteproduced KC. These results not only demonstrate the intricate interaction of the innate and adaptive immune systems during the elicitation of an antigen-specific response but suggest a strategy for interrupting the recruitment of antigen-specific T cells during CD8 + T cell-mediated hypersensitivity responses in the skin.

We hypothesized that the chemokine(s) expressed at the earliest time point after hapten challenge may indicate a critical chemoattractant cytokine for effector CD8 + T cell recruitment to the challenge site during eliciation of the response. To identify chemokines expressed early after hapten challenge, the ears from 2,4-dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB)-sensitized and unsensitized mice were challenged with DNFB and then excised at various times. The ear tissue was homogenized, RNA was prepared and analyzed for chemokine gene expression by Northern blot analysis. KC was the earliest chemokine expressed after hapten application in this screen (Fig. 1). KC was expressed as early as 30 min following hapten application and was observed in the hapten-challenged ears from both DNFB-sensitized and unsensitized animals. KC expression was absent in ears which were not challenged with DNFB (Fig. 1, lane 1). In contrast to KC expression, IFN-inducible protein-10 (IP-10) and the murine homologue of monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (JE) were expressed at later time points ( e.g. beginning at 8 h post-challenge) and only in hapten-sensitized animals, suggesting that expression of these two chemokines was dependent upon T cell priming.

The hapten-mediated induction of KC expression in a keratinocyte cell line, PAM 212, was then tested. Expression of KC was induced within 2.5 h of 0.1 mM DNFB labeling and persisted for at least 44 h after the labeling period (Fig. 2 A). This expression was evident at low levels as early as 30 min after labeling (data not shown). Low expression of KC was also observed in unlabeled cells at early times due to the washing treatment during the experiment. PAM 212 cells did not express JE (or IP-

10) following labeling with DNFB. PAM 212 cells did express IP-10 and JE, however, when supernatants from activated, hapten-immune CD8 + T cells were added to cultures of the cells (data not shown). In contrast to PAM 212 cells, labeling of a B cell lymphoma (A20.1), a T cell hybridoma (MTs 79.1) or a macrophage cell line (RAW 264) with 0.1 M DNFB did not induce KC expression at 10 h (Fig. 2 B).

To test production of KC protein by PAM 212 cells following hapten labeling, culture supernatants from DNFBlabeled and unlabeled cells were analyzed by Western

The culture supernatants were collected, absorbed with heparin sulfate-Sepharose, and the bound material separated by SDS-PAGE. Supernatant from a fibroblast transfected with KC in a retroviral expression cassette was absorbed and used as a positive control in the analysis. The KC-specific antiserum reacted with the absorbed supernatant from the transfected fibroblast and from hapten-labeled, but not unlabeled, PAM 212 cells (Fig. 3 A). KC was not detected in

Inclusion of the KC-specific antiserum in the in vitro chemotaxis assays inhibited the chemotaxis of the cells to recombinant KC (Fig. 3 B).

## 2.2 Inhibition of CHS by antiserum to KC

Since KC was the first chemokine expressed and produced following hapten application to the epidermis, we tested the ability of the KC-specific antiserum to inhibit elicitation of the CHS response. Animals were sensitized with DNFB (days 0 and + 1) and were given either normal rabbit serum (NRS) or the KC-specific antiserum on days +4 and +5. Immediately after the second injection of serum, the animals were ear challenged with DNFB and the increase in the ear swelling response was measured 24 h later. Treatment with the KC antiserum inhibited the ear swelling response to near background levels (Fig. 4 A). To test the role of KC directly on the CD8 + T cell-mediated CHS response, the KC antiserum was also tested in animals depleted of CD4 + T cells prior to hapten sensitization (Fig. 4 B). Again, the KC antiserum inhibited the magnitude of the response to near background levels.

In contrast to the DNFB response, results from this laboratory have indicated an effector CD4 + T cell component in the CHS response to oxazolone (Ox) which is observed in mice depleted of CD8 + T cells prior to sensitization with the hapten [7]. To examine the effect of the KC antiserum on the CD4 + vs. CD8 + T cell-mediated response to Ox, mice were treated with control Ig, antiCD4 mAb, or anti-CD8 mAb prior to sensitization with Ox. The sensitized animals were again given NRS or the KC antiserum the day before and the day of challenge with hapten and the ear swelling response was determined 24 h later. The KC antiserum consistently inhibited the magnitude of the CD4 + T cell CHS response to Ox to a greater degree than the antiserum inhibited the CD8 + T cell-mediated response (Fig. 5).

We reasoned that if KC was required for recruitment of the effector CD8 + T cells to the hapten challenge site in CHS, directly transferring hapten-primed CD8 + T cells into the ear just before challenge should circumvent the requirement for KC production. Animals were sensitized with DNFB and treated with NRS or KC antiserum as above. Some groups of mice were injected with DNFBimmune lymph node cells (LNC) from CD4 + T celldepleted donors directly into the ear tissue and then all animals were challenged with either DNFB or an irrelevant hapten, Ox. As observed in the previous experi-

Groups of four mice were given 100 g rat IgG, anti-CD4 mAb ( CD4), or antiCD8 mAb ( CD8) on three consecutive days and 2 days later, the animals were sensitized with 3 % Ox (day 0). On days + 4 and + 5, sensitized mice were given 0.5 ml NRS or rabbit KC antiserum ( KC) i.p. After the final injection of serum, hapten-sensitized and nonsensitized, control animals were challenged on both sides of each ear with 0.6 % Ox. The thickness of hapten-challenged ears was measured 24 h later and expressed as change ( ) in ear swelling × 10 -4 in. ± SEM. p Values shown indicate significance of KC antiserum-mediated inhibition within each antibody treatment (Ab Tx) group.

After the final injection of serum, hapten-sensitized and nonsensitized, control animals were challenged on both sides of each ear with 0.2 % DNFB.

ment, treatment with the KC antiserum inhibited the magnitude of the CHS response to background levels of ear swelling (Fig. 6, group 2 vs. 1 and 5). Delivery of LNC from CD4 + T cell-depleted sensitized mice (immune CD8 + T cells) to the ear tissue followed by hapten challenge circumvented the inhibition of the response mediated by the KC-specific antiserum (group 3). The hapten specificity of the transfered DNFB immune T cells was demonstrated by challenging recipient animals with Ox (group 4), which did not induce ear swelling. These results suggested that KC was a critical factor recruiting immune CD8 + T cells to the challenge site during the elicitation of CHS.

DNFB- or Ox-sensitized mice by KC (Fig. 3 B and data not shown). This raised the possibility that the KC requirement for recruitment of immune CD8 + T cells into hapten challenge sites during the CHS response might be indirectly mediated through neutrophils. This was first examined by testing the effect of neutrophil depletion on the CHS responses. DNFB-sensitized mice (days 0 and +1) were given NRS, KC antiserum, or neutrophildepleting mAb, RB6.8C5, on days + 4 and +5. On day +5, all groups of mice were challenged on the ears with DNFB and the increase in ear swelling was measured the following day. Depletion of neutrophils was as effective as, and in most experiments more effective than, the KC antiserum in inhibiting the magnitude of the ear swelling response (Fig. 7). Again, injecting (Ox) immune CD8 + T cells into the ears and then challenging with the specific (Ox) hapten (Fig. 8, groups 2 and 3) circumvented the inhibition observed in neutrophil-depleted mice. Delivery of DNFB-immune CD8 + T cells and challenge with Ox did not restore the ear swelling response, indicating the hapten specificity of the transfer (group 4).

The ability of neutrophil transfer to circumvent inhibition of the CHS response mediated by treatment with the KC antiserum was tested. Mice were sensitized with DNFB and were given either NRS or KC antiserum on days + 4 and +5. Immediately prior to challenge with either DNFB or Ox, thioglycollate-induced PEC were injected s.c. into the ear tissue. Inhibition of the CHS response mediated

After the final injection of serum, hapten-sensitized and nonsensitized, control animals were challenged on both sides of each ear with 0.2 % DNFB or 0.6% Ox. Donor mice were given 100 g rat anti-CD4 mAb on three consecutive days and 2 days later the animals were sensitized with DNFB. Prior to hapten challenge, the indicated groups of DNFBsensitized recipients were injected intradermally into the ear tissue with 5 × 10 6 immune LNC from donor mice (CD8 trans).

Challenge of KC-treated, DNFB-immune recipients of neutrophils with Ox did not restore the ear swelling response (group 4), indicating that the restoration of the response in group 3 was not due to nonspecific inflammatory effects induced by the transfer of neutrophils.

Finally, we tested if neutrophils were required in the transfer cell inoculum in order to restore the CHS response in sensitized mice treated with KC antiserum at the time of hapten challenge. Donor animals were treated with control rat IgG or with RB6 on two consecutive days and 2 h after the final injection of Ig the mice were given thioglycollate i.p. After 4 h, the PEC were collected and were injected into the ears of DNFBsensitized mice that had been treated with the KC antiserum. Following cell transfer, the ears were challenged with DNFB and the magnitude of the ear swelling response was measured 24 h later. As observed in the previous experiment, transfer of thioglycollate-elicited PEC from rat IgG-treated donors to hapten-sensitized recipients treated with KC antiserum restored the CHS response following hapten challenge (Fig. 10, group 2

vs. 4). In contrast, transfer of thioglycollate-elicited PEC from RB6-treated donors was unable to restore CHS in KC antiserum-treated mice (group 5). In vitro treatment of thioglycollate-induced PEC with RB6 plus C', but not with C' alone, also abrogated the ability of the PEC to circumvent the inhibition of the CHS response observed following treatment of hapten-sensitized mice with the KCantiserum before hapten challenge (data not shown).

## 3 Discussion

Based upon the in vivo and in vitro chemoattractant properties of chemokines [8, 9], we hypothesized that specific chemokines would be critical in recruiting hapten-primed CD8 + T cells to challenge sites during the elicitation of CHS. Expression of chemokine genes during the induction and/or elicitation of CHS have been previously reported [15-17] but the role of chemokines in the elicitation or down-regulation of the response has remained untested. Our previous results indicated expression of JE, KC and IP-10 in hapten-challenged ear tissue of immune mice at the peak time ( i. e. 24 h postchallenge) of the ear swelling response [13]. Indicative of the role of CD8 + and CD4 + T cells as effector and regulatory T cells in CHS, expression of IP-10 and KC was absent in animals depleted of CD8 + T cells and was increased in animals depleted of CD4 + T cells at this time point. Results presented in the current report indicate

On days + 4 and + 5, sensitized mice were given 0.5 ml NRS or rabbit KC antiserum i.p. After the final injection of serum, hapten-sensitized and nonsensitized, control animals were challenged on both sides of each ear with 0.2 % DNFB or 0.6 % Ox. Donor mice were given 1 ml thioglycollate i.p. and 4 h later the PEC were collected. Prior to hapten challenge, the indicated groups of DNFBsensitized recipients were injected intradermally into the ear tissue with 10 5 PEC. The thickness of hapten-challenged ears was measured 24 h later and expressed as change ( ) in ear swelling × 10 -4 in. ± SEM.

that KC is expressed within 0.5-2 h of hapten application to the epidermis and to keratinocyte cell cultures. Staining of hapten-challenged tissue sections with the KC antiserum indicates that the KC protein is localized in the epidermis, consistent with the proposal that hapteninduced production of KC may be restricted to keratinocytes (unpublished results). KC expression in ear tissue begins to decline after the peak of the CHS response is attained [13]. By contrast, expression of KC by haptenlabeled PAM 212 cells is maintained for at least 2 days, suggesting the absence of mechanisms which function in vivo to restrict the duration of KC production by keratinocytes.

In contrast to the hapten-induced expression of KC, detectable levels of IP-10 and JE were not expressed in ear tissue until 8 h post-challenge. Previous results from this laboratory have indicated that expression of IP-10 during CHS is dependent on hapten-primed CD8 + T cells [13]. Consistent with this, PAM 212 cells did not express IP-10 or JE following hapten labeling but did express these chemokine genes following addition of supernatants from hapten-immune, but not naive, T cells cultured on anti-CD3-coated wells (N. Dilulio, unpublished results). Since IP-10 is induced by IFN[18], these

¿

results suggest that it is at approximately 8 h postchallenge that immune CD8 + T cells begin to infiltrate the hapten challenge site and are activated by hapten presentation to produce IFN. Preliminary in situ hybridization results indicate that IP-10 expression is restricted to the subepidermal area and suggest this location for CD8 + T cell cytokine production during the response (D. Armstrong, unpublished results). In contrast to the results presented in the current report, other investigators have reported the expression of IP-10 and IFNwithin 2 h following hapten application to the ears of unsensitized mice [16]. This early expression of IFNbut not IP-10 was dependent upon the presence of T cells. Experiments to define the role of IP-10 and other T cell chemoattractants in mediating T cell recruitment to the hapten challenge site during the CHS response are in progress.

Studies by several laboratories have demonstrated the ability to inhibit leukocyte infiltration and tissue pathology using antibodies or other neutralizing reagents for specific chemokines [10-12]. The major goal of the current work was to identify the earliest chemokines produced during CHS and to test the effect of chemokine neutralization on the elicitation of the response. As reported, recruitment of immune CD8 + T cells into the challenge site of hapten-sensitized mice and elicitation

of CHS was inhibited by a rabbit antiserum specific for a KC peptide. Delivering immune CD8 + T cells intradermally into the ear and then challenging the tissue circumvented the inhibition of this recruitment and the ear swelling response. This indicates that KC plays a key role in T cell recruitment to the challenge site. Based upon the results of other investigators demonstrating the chemoattraction of splenic and peripheral blood T cells by neutrophil chemoattractant (CXC) chemokines such as IL-8 [19-21], we initially interpreted our results as indicating the direct chemoattraction of hapten-primed T cells to KC produced at the hapten challenge site. In vitro assays to test chemoattraction of LN T cells from hapten-sensitized mice using supernatants from haptenlabeled PAM 212 cells, however, were completely negative (unpublished results). Results from the current report suggest that recruitment of CD8 + T cells by KC production in CHS is mediated indirectly through neutrophils infiltrating the challenge site.

Many studies have indicated the early neutrophil infiltration of hapten challenge sites during CHS [22, 23]. This early neutrophil infiltration was presumed to be a component of the nonspecific inflammatory response. Results presented in the current report suggest that the early KC-mediated infiltration of hapten challenge sites

by neutrophils is required for T cell recruitment and the elicitation of CHS. Similarly, the recruitment of human T cells to the site of intradermal injection of human recombinant IL-8 is mediated through neutrophils [24]. Neutrophils are also required for elicitation of CD4 + T cellmediated responses in rats, including delayed-type hypersensitivity responses to sheep red blood cells, LPS-induced pulmonary inflammation, and adjuvantinduced arthritis in rats [25-27]. The current results are the first to indicate the requirement for neutrophils for the recruitment of effector CD8 + T cells to elicit CHS. The mechanism by which neutrophils mediate T cell recruitment during the CHS response is unknown at this time. Neutrophils produce many chemoattractants, including chemokines, following stimulation by IL-8 at inflammatory tissue sites [28-30] and these cytokines may participate in hapten-primed T cell recruitment in CHS. Preliminary results have indicated that the magnitude of the ear swelling response in hapten-sensitized animals either depleted of neutrophils or treated with KC antiserum directly correlates with the number of neutrophils injected into the ear tissue (T. Engeman, unpublished results). This suggests that the magnitude of the cutaneous immune (ear swelling) response may be dependent on the degree of neutrophil infiltration into the challenge site.

In conjunction with our previous results, the results of the current report demonstrate that the elicitation of CHS requires a complex cascade of cytokines and leukocyte infiltration into the hapten challenge site, integrating innate as well as antigen-specific components of the immune response. The elicitation of the response is initiated by the production of KC that directs neutrophil infiltration into the hapten challenge site. Neutrophil infiltration of the hapten challenge site appears to facilitate recruitment of the CD8 + T cells that are stimulated by the hapten to produce the pro-inflammatory cytokines that mediate the immune response. The exposure of these innate immune components suggests new strategies for controlling such cutaneous hypersensitivity responses. Rather than directing inhibitory strategies directly at the effector T cell level, the elicitation and duration of such responses may be alleviated by inhibiting neutrophil infiltration and/or activity at the sites. Indeed, preliminary results indicate that the elevated and prolonged CHS responses observed in the absence of CD4 + T cells ( e.g. in CD4 + T cell-depleted mice) are decreased following administration of anti-neutrophil antibody (T. Engeman, unpublished results). Just as importantly, the results of the current report suggest that the absence of a cutaneous immune response may be circumvented by delivery of neutrophils or their T cell recruitment factors to the specific site where an immune response is needed.

## 4 Materials and methods

## 4.1 Animals

BALB/c mice were obtained through Dr. Clarence Reeder at the National Cancer Institute (Frederick, MD). Adult females of 6-10 weeks of age were used throughout this study.

## 4.2 Sensitization and elicitation of CHS

?

Mice were sensitized and challenged to elicit CHS responses to DNFB and to Ox as previously described [6, 13]. For the induction of CHS to DNFB, groups of four mice were sensitized by two daily paintings (days 0 and + 1) with 25 l of 0.25 % DNFB (Sigma Chem. Co., St. Louis, MO) on the shaved abdomen and 5 l on the footpads. For the induction of CHS to Ox, mice were sensitized by a single painting (day 0) of 25 l of 3 % Ox on the shaved abdomen and 5 l on the footpads. On day + 5, the ear thickness of sensitized and unsensitized, control animals was measured with an engineer's micrometer (Mitutoyo, Elk Grove Village, IL) and each animal was challenged by applying 10 l of 0.2 % DNFB or 0.6 % Ox to each side of both ears. Increase in ear swelling was measured in a blinded manner 24 h after challenge and expressed in units of 10 -4 in. The magnitude of ear swelling is given as the mean increase of each group of three to four individual animals ( i. e. six to eight ears) ± SEM. The statistical significance of ear swelling responses between experimental groups of mice was determined using Student's t -test.

## 4.3 Antibodies and antiserum

mAb from the culture supernatant of the IgG-producing hybridomas YTS 191.1.2, anti-mouse CD4 [31], YTS 169.4.2.1, anti-mouse CD8 [31], and RB6.8C5, anti-mouse neutrophil antibody [32], were purified by protein G chromatography. Rabbit immune serum to a KC-specific peptide (sequence QTMAGIHLKNIQS) was made at BioSynthesis, Inc. (Louisville, TX). NRS was used as control Ig for in vivo treatment experiments. Mice were depleted of CD4 + or CD8 + T cells by giving 100g aliquots of YTS 191 or YTS 169, respectively, on days - 3, - 2 and - 1 before hapten sensitization on day 0 as previously described [6, 13]. This resulted in 96% CD4 + T cell depletion in treated mice as assessed by antibody staining and flow cytometry analyses (data not shown). Mice were depleted of neutrophils by giving 100g aliquots of RB6.8C5 on two consecutive days. This treatment resulted in 5%neutrophils in the peritoneal wash of mice 4 h after thioglycollate injection as assessed by staining the peritoneal cells with Wright's stain.

## 4.4 Analysis of gene expression

Chemokine gene expression in hapten-challenged ear tissue was examined by Northern blot analysis of whole cell

?

RNA isolated from homogenized ear tissue, as previously described [13]. Briefly, both ears of all mice in each group were excised and homogenized in 4 M guanidium isothiocyanate using a Polytron homogenizer (Brinkman, Westbury, NY). The tissue homogenate was layered over a 5.7 M CsCl2 gradient and the RNA pelleted by centrifugation. Following suspension in DEPC-treated dH2O, 15g aliquots of RNA were electrophoresed in 1 % agarose-formaldehyde denaturing gels and analyzed by Northern blot hybridization as previously described. Filters were probed with 32 P-labeled oligonucleotide probes specific for JE [33], KC [33], and IP10 [34]. For each experiment, a single filter was prepared and probed with three different chemokine probes under the same prehybridization and hybridization conditions. After hybridization and exposure with one oligonucleotide probe, the filter was stripped of the probe by washing the blot 3X in Tris-EDTA at 90 °C and then hybridized with the next test probe. After hybridization with the chemokine probes was completed, the filter was stripped and reprobed with a rat glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)specific cDNA [35]. All experiments were repeated two or three times with similar results observed each time and the results from a single representative experiment are shown.

## 4.5 In vitro cell culture and labeling with DNFB

PAM 212 cells, a murine keratinocyte cell line, were maintained as adherent cell monolayers in RPMI supplemented with 10 % FCS (Sigma Chem. Co., St. Louis, MO), glutamine and gentamycin. Confluent 48 h cultures were washed 3X with HBSS, 0.1 mM DNFB in HBSS was added, and the plated were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C in 5 % CO2. The cell monolayer was washed 3X with HBSS, fresh medium was added and cells were cultured for the time indicated in Sect. 2. At the end of the culture period, the cells were washed 3X with cold PBS and lysed with TRIzol ® (Life Technologies Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) for RNA isolation. B cell (A20.1), T cell (MTs 79.1) and macrophage (RAW 264) cell lines were washed extensively with HBSS and resuspended at 10 7 cells/ml. The cells were hapten labeled with 0.1 mM DNFB for 10 min at 37 °C in 5 % CO2. The cells were washed with HBSS and cultured at 2 × 10 6 cells/ml for 10 h before lysis with TRIzol ® The entire coding region of murine KC [36] was cloned into the BamH1 site of the pBabe Puro retroviral vector [36]. This construct was used to transfect the murine packaging fibroblast cell line GP + E. Puromycin-resistant cells were cloned and clones were assessed for KC expression by Northern blot analysis. The clone expressing the highest level of KC RNA was utilized in these studies to prepare culture supernatant for absorption of KC protein.

## 4.6 Adsorption of KC from cell culture supernatants and Western blot analysis

KC was absorbed from culture supernatants of haptenlabeled PAM 212 cells with heparin sulfate-Sepharose. Hep-

arin sulfate-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech, Inc., Piscataway, NJ) was swollen in DEPC-treated dH2O and washed 3X in 25 mM phosphate buffer. Culture supernatants from hapten-labeled and unlabeled PAM 212 cells were dialyzed overnight in 25 mM phosphate buffer. Approximately 200 l of a 25 % slurry of the heparin-Sepharose beads was added to 10 ml of culture supernatant and rocked overnight. The beads were washed 3 × in 25 mM phosphate buffer, suspended in Laemmli buffer, and separated by reducing SDSPAGE. Following electrophoresis, the proteins were electroblotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (BioRad, Richmond, CA) for detection. The blot was blocked in 5 % nonfat dry milk and was incubated with immune rabbit serum to KC for 2 h at room temperature. The blot was incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit Ig antibody, F(ab') 2 fragment, (Amersham, Arlington Heights, IL) diluted 1:1500 and developed with the Amersham ECL ® kit.

## 4.7 Chemotaxis assays

To test neutrophil chemotaxis to KC, in vitro chemotaxis assays were performed using a 96-well chemotaxis chamber with an adhesive polycarbonate filter separating the upper and lower wells (NeuroProbe, Gaithersburg, MD). Triplicate titrations of recombinant KC (R &amp; D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) in DMEM with 0.5% FCS were placed in the lower wells and 10 5 thioglycollate-induced PEC/well in the upper wells and the chamber was incubated overnight at 37°C. After 18 h the medium in the upper chamber was aspirated and the chamber was disassembled. The 96-well plate and filter were centrifuged at 1000 rpm to pellet the migrated cells. The cells were washed with PBS and counted by a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) colorometric assay.

?

A standard number of thioglycollate-induced PEC was added to the chemotaxis plate and serially diluted for use as a standard curve. The MTT (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) was prepared at 1 mg/ml in RPMI without phenol red, FCS, or 2-ME and 100 l was added to each well of the chemotaxis plate. The plate was incubated with rocking at 37 °C and 3 h later the plate was centrifuged, the supernatant removed, and the MTT crystals were dissolved in 100 % ethanol. The plate was read in an automated microplate reader at 490 and 595 nm dual wavelengths. The results are expressed as the average number of migrated cells ± SEM. Inhibition of neutrophil chemotaxis by the KC-specific antiserum was tested by adding 50 l of the KC-specific antiserum or, as a control, NRS to the lower well of the chemotaxis chamber with the recombinant mouse KC. The chemotaxis assay was performed and quantitated as described above.

## 4.8 Transfer of cell populations to ear tissue

G

Neutrophils were elicited by injection of 1 ml sterile thioglycollate (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, MI) i. p. and 4 h later washing the peritoneal cavity with HBSS plus heparin. Wright's stain and microscopic examination of aliquots of the peritoneal wash cells indicated 70% neutrophils. The PEC were washed, resuspended at 2 × 10 6 cells/ml in HBSS and 50 l were injected intradermally into the ear. Haptenimmune CD8 + T cells were obtained from mice treated with 100g aliquots of YTS 191 (anti-CD4 mAb) on days - 3, - 2 and -1 before hapten sensitization on day 0. On day + 4, LNC suspensions were prepared, washed, and resuspended at 10 8 /ml in PBS and 50l aliquots were injected intradermally into the ear. Immediately following cell transfer, ears were challenged with hapten and the increase in ear swelling was measured 24 h later.
