Granulocyte  colony-stimulating  factor (G-CSF) is a glycoprotein hormone that specifically  stimulates both production and functional activation of neutrophils, while interferon-a (IFN-a) is known to suppress myelopoiesis,  including neutrophil production in vivo and in vitro. On a possibility  that IFN-a may operate as one of the inhibitoryfeedback  factors in neutropoiesis, we examined  whether  neutrophils produce IFN-a  in response to G-CSF.  Northern blot analysis showed that  messenger RNA (mRNA) for human IFN-a 1 became  detectable  time-dependently in  highly  purified human  neutrophils  incubated  with  purified  recombinant human G-CSF  (rhG-CSF).  But such transcription  was not

LOOD NEUTROPHILS are normally  maintained at B very precise levels; elevated levels accompanying  bacterial  or  fungal  infection  rapidly  return  to normal  when  the infection  is  eliminated. This phenomenon  may be  logically explained by the presence of  inhibitors that are triggered by increased neutropoiesis. To  address  this  issue, it seems natural  to  pay  attention  to  the  two  factors  granulocyte colony-stimulating  factor (G-CSF) and interferon-a  (IFNa), with the following rationale.  First, G-CSF is a glycoprotein  that is known not  only to specifically  stimulate neutrophil production but also to  activate mature  neutrophil functions  in  vitro.'' Recent  clinical trials  with purified recombinant  human  G-CSF  (rhG-CSF)  showed  that  the factor  acts  in  vivo  as   ell.^'^  In  addition, we  previously reported  that serum G-CSF levels fluctuate according to the requirement  for  stimulation  of neutrophil  production or neutrophil f~nctions.'.~  hese findings strongly indicate that T G-CSF is a true circulating hormone that acts in all stages of neutrophil differentation. Second, IFN-a is shown to inhibit neutrophil  colony  formation  in  vitro  beyond its  original definition,'  and the in vivo actions of  purified  rhIFN-a  are also  assessed  through  its  clinical  use.' Furthermore,  although it is generally known that IFN-a is usually produced from virally  stimulated  lymphoblastoid  cells,'  a possibility still  remains  that IFN-a may also be  produced  by  neutrophils, as suggested by the report that the factor was produced by chronic myelogenous leukemia cells.'' So we attempted to determine whether or not neutrophils could produce  IFN-a in  response  to  rhG-CSF.  The  results  presented  here  may provide evidence for a  role of  the IFN-a/G-CSF system  in the feedback inhibitory regulation of neutropoiesis.

## MATERIALS AND METHODS

Cell isolation. Blood buffy coat fractions  were collected using a Haemonetics V-50 Apheresis  System  (Haemonetics Corporation, Natick, MA) from a normal healthy volunteer who gave informed consent. After removal o f   the contaminated  red blood cells (RBC)  b y dextran sedimentation  for 1 hour at room temperature,  the resultant leukocyte-rich fractions were centrifuged  at 400 x  g for 30 minutes on a  discontinuous  Percoll  (Sigma  Chemical, St. Louis,  MO) gradient  (specific  gravities:  1.080  and 1.100) for  separation of mature  neutrophils  or  on  Lymphoprep  (Nycomed, Norway)  for separation  of mononuclear cells. Purity  and viability o f  each  cell type obtained in this way were more than 95%.

observed either in neutrophils incubated with other neutrophil activators, such as formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine  (fMLP)  or lipopolysaccharides  (LPS),  or in blood mononuclear  cells  incubated  with  rhG-CSF.  In  addition, radioimmunoassay  for human IFN-a showed that its levels in culture medium of the rhG-CSF-treated  neutrophils rose markedly (up to approximately 100 IU/mL/l x I O 7   cells) in a time-dependent  way, compared with those of nonstimulated neutrophils. These findings suggest that the G-CSF/ IFN-a  system  may participate in the feedback  regulatory loop of neutropoiesis.

Purified  rhG-CSF. rhG-CSF (specific activity about 1 x IO8 U/mg  protein)  was  prepared  from  the  conditioned  medium  of genetically engineered mouse C 1271  cells, as reported previously.' In  all experiments a final concentration of  50  ng/mL  was  chosen because the maximum stimulation  of both neutrophil colony formation in vitro b y   human marrow cells and superoxide generation b y human neutrophils was obtained in the range of 10 to  100 ng/mL (data not shown).

IFN-a  cDNA. This was a full-length human IFN-a 1 complementary DNA (cDNA) prepared by digesting  a Hif-2h plasmid with Pst-1 l 4 and was labeled with j2P-dCTP  (specific radioactivity  about 1 x 10'  cpm/pg)  (New  England  Nuclear, Boston,  MA)  by  the primer extension method.ls

Each  1 x lo7 freshly prepared  neutrophils or mononuclear cells were  suspended in  10 mL  RPMI  1640 medium supplemented with 0.1%  bovine serum  albumin  (RIA grade) (Sigma) in the presence or absence of  rhG-CSF, LPS, or fMLP (Sigma) at a final  concentration  of 50  ng/mL, 10 ng/mL,  or 1 nmol/mL, respectively. The cell suspension was incubated in a plastic dish (no. 1008,  Falcon,  Lincoln Park, NJ) at 3 7 O C  in fully  humidified 5% CO, air for up to 15 hours. At intervals, the cells and the supernatants were harvested by centrifugation  for the following assays. Cell  culture.

Total cellular RNA was isolated from the cultured cells b y   the  guanidine thiocyanate (GTC) method.I6 Each 20 pg of  RNA sample  was electrophoresed  on a 0.8% agarose gel  and  blotted  onto  BA85  nitrocellulose  filters  (Schleicher &amp; Schnell, Dassel, West Germany). RNA blots were hybridized with the radiolabeled IFN-a 1 cDNA probe and then autoradiographied by  the conventional  method^.'^ Northern blot  analysis.

Pooled culture supernatant was assayed for IFN content  using a human IFN-a radioimmunoassay kit (DAINADOT Co Ltd, Tokyo, Japan) according to its instructions. IFN-a assay.

Figure 1A shows the results of Northern blot analysis on neutrophils  before  and  after incubation.  Any  message  for IFN-a was not detected with preincubated neutrophils (lane 7) and with neutrophils incubated for 3 or 6 hours without rhG-CSF  (lanes  1  and  2). In  contrast, the.neutrophils incubated with rhG-CSF (50 ng/mL)  were found to transcribe  the  IFN-a  messenger  RNA  (mRNA)  in  a  timedependent way. Thus, the transcripts appeared after 3 hours' incubation (lane 3) and became more distinct after 6 and 9 hours'  incubations (lanes 4 and 6). The bands consisted  of two components:  a major one of  about 950 base pairs (bp), and a minor one of about  1,200 bp. The size of the former band was the same as previously reported,"  while that of the latter was considered to represent one of the IFN-a mRNAs with  different  3'  noncoding  regions.  On the other hand, we could  not  detect any message  with mononuclear cells incubated in the same  condition (data not shown).

## RESULTS

To further  determine  whether  the  transcriptional  effect was specifically induced by  rhG-CSF,  effects of  LPS (final concentration 10 ng/mL)  and fMLP (final concentration 1 nmol/mL)  were  also  examined  in  the same experimental system.  In  these  experiments,  any  transcription  of  IFN-a mRNA in neutrophils was not observed after 3 or 6 hours' incubations (lane 5 in Fig  1A and lanes 5 and 6 in Fig 1B). With fMLP, we also checked neutrophils incubated for 1,3, 10, and 60 minutes since most of intracellular events relevant to the factor are known to occur during such short periods. However, again we could not detect any expression of IFN-a mRNA (lanes 1 through 4 in Fig 1 B).

The expression of IFN-a mRNA in the rhG-CSF-treated neutrophils does not necessarily mean that IFN-a protein is actually  produced  and secreted. So, levels of  IFN-a  in  the

medium conditioned  by the neutrophils were estimated using a radioimmunoassay specific for human IFN-a. As shown in Fig 2,  the levels  of  the rhG-CSF-treated neutrophils were found to rise 6 hours after the culture initiation and reached about 100  IU/mL/I x lo7 neutrophils  after  12  hours' incubation,  whereas  those  by  the  nontreated  neutrophils remained around 20 IU/mL/l x lo7 neutrophils during the course of incubation.

## DISCUSSION

The neutrophil fractions used here were almost pure, and most of the contaminating cells (less than 5%), if  any, were

eosinophils  and monocytes  that  are generally  known  to  be unresponsive to rhG-CSF.  Furthermore, the possibility  that mononuclear cells consisting of lymphocytes and monocytes, like neutrophils, might respond to rhG-CSF either directly or indirectly  to transcript IFN-a mRNA was excluded. Therefore,  it  is  apparent  that  rhG-CSF  specifically  stimulates neutrophils themselves to transcription of IFN-a mRNA.

In this  report  we  also  show  that  IFN-a  was  actually secreted  by neutrophils in response to rhG-CSF.  It  is interesting to  note that  the maximum  level  of  IFN-a  was high  (100  IU/mL)  enough  to  suppress  neutrophil  colony formation  in  vitro  by  human  bone  marrow These findings  may  support  the  view  that  IFN-a  may  play  an important  role in the  feedback  inhibitory  regulation of

neutropoiesis.  However,  the following  two points  should be under  consideration  for  this view.  First,  similar  inhibitory feedback  mechanism  via  IFNs  has  been  also  reported  in macrophage  production,  in  which  CSF-1  specific  for  a monocyte-macrophage lineage  is  proposed  as a  candidate capable  of stimulating  mature  macrophages  to  produce IFNs.'  Second,  IFN-a is  also  known  to  suppress in  vivo production of not only neutrophils but also platelets. Further studies,  including  simultaneous  estimation  of  IFN-a  and rhG-CSF levels in relation to neutropoiesis, will be needed to define in vivo significance of the IFN-a/G-CSF system and, if this is the case, to determine how much weight the system may be given in neutropoiesis.
