## Abstract

Neutrophils  are  known  as  one  of  the  first  lines  of  defense  in  the  innate  immune response and can perform many particular cellular functions, such as chemotaxis, reverse migration, phagocytosis, degranulation of cytotoxic enzymes and metabolites, and release of DNA as neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). Neutrophils not only have tightly regulated signaling themselves, but also participate in the regulation of other components of the immune system. As fresh neutrophils are terminally differentiated, short-lived, and highly variable among individuals, it is important to make the most of  the  collected  samples.  Researchers often need to perform screening assays to assess an overview of the many neutrophil functions that may be affected by specific conditions  under  evaluation.  A  set  of  tests  following  a  single  isolation  process  of normal density neutrophils was developed to address this need, seeking a balance between speed, comprehensiveness, cost, and accuracy. The results can be used to reason and guide in-depth follow-up studies. This procedure can be carried out in an average time of 4 h and includes the evaluation of cell viability, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by Nitrotetrazolium Blue Chloride (NBT), real-time migration, and phagocytosis  of  yeast  on  glass  slides,  leaving  enough  cells  left  for  more  detailed approaches like  omics  studies.  Moreover,  the  procedure  includes  a  way  to  easily observe a preliminary suggestion of NETs after fast panoptic staining observed by light microscopy, with a lack of specific markers, albeit enough to indicate if further efforts in that way would be worthwhile. The diversity of functions tested combines common points among tests, reducing the analysis time and expenses. Although the NeutroFun Screen has limitations, it balances the aforementioned factors. Furthermore, the aim of this work is not a definite test set, but rather a guideline that can easily be adjusted to each lab's resources and demands.

## Introduction

Neutrophils  are  the  most  abundant  innate  immune  cells in  human  blood  and  are  known  to  play  a  major  part  in infection  and  inflammation,  being  the  first  responders  to arrive at the  site of tissue damage 1 .  In  recent  years, there  has  been  a  growing  recognition  of  the  crucial  role that neutrophils play in a variety of diseases and  in supporting  homeostasis 2 .  Neutrophils  not  only  have  tightly regulated  signaling  themselves,  but  also  participate  in  the regulation of other components of the immune system 3,4,5 . Therefore, investigating neutrophils and their many unusual cellular  functions,  such  as  chemotaxis,  reverse  migration 6 , phagocytosis 7 , respiratory burst 8 , and the release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) 7 , is imperative in numerous  research  contexts where  it is necessary to assess the potential neutrophil functional, morphological, or molecular  changes  triggered  by  specific  conditions  under analysis.

Freshly  isolated  neutrophils  are  terminally  differentiated, short-lived, highly dynamic, and easily activated 9 . However, an efficient storage method that does not affect the neutrophil responses has not yet been achieved, making it challenging to perform  multiple  assays  that  must  be  uninterrupted. Furthermore, previously described functional analyses 10,11 , based on assays that require cytometry and/or fluorescent staining, may not be a viable choice when a broad and initial evaluation of the neutrophil is needed.

To  address  these  issues,  this  protocol  describes  a  set  of tests  that  can  be  carried  out  following  a  single  isolation process,  including  the  evaluation  of  cell  viability,  reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, real-time migration, and  phagocytosis  of Saccharomyces  cerevisiae , whose

results  can  be  used  to  reason  in-depth  follow-up  studies. This  procedure,  named  NeutroFun  Screen,  was  designed to encompass the leading effector activities, except degranulation, and can be completed in an average time of 4 h, including 1 h of activation. Additionally, the remaining cells can be used for more detailed approaches like omics studies. The  advantage  of  this  method  lies  in  its  balance  between speed, comprehensiveness, cost, and accuracy.

Furthermore, there is a way to easily observe a preliminary suggestion of NETs, without specific markers, but enough to indicate if further efforts in that direction would be worthwhile. The diversity of functions tested aims to combine common points among tests, reducing the analysis time and expenses. The  main  goal  of  this  method  is  to  provide  a  balanced, functional  analysis  regarding  speed,  comprehensiveness, cost,  and  accuracy  that  allows  for  an  overview  of  the neutrophil's  response,  making  it  a  useful  initial  step  in investigating  the  effects  of  novel  stimuli  on  normal  density neutrophils.

## Protocol

All  experiments  strictly  followed  the  ethical  guidelines  set by the institutional review board at the University of Brasilia (process 13364819.0.0000.5558), and samples were identified by codes to ensure donor anonymity. The cells were obtained from normal healthy male donors aged 18-35 years, who signed informed consent and met the following eligibility criteria:  non-smokers/vapers,  no  chronic  health  conditions, and no history of inflammatory conditions in the last 14 days.

## 1. Blood collection

- 1. Aseptically  place  0.3  mL  of  5,000  IU/mL  heparin  (see Table  of  Materials ) in a  sterile 20  mL  syringe  to heparinize it.
- 2. Apply a venous tourniquet about 4 in above the puncture site and identify the median cubital or cephalic vein for venipuncture.
- NOTE:  Ensure  that  the  total  tourniquet  time  does  not exceed 1 min.
- 3. Clean the puncture site with 70% alcohol and perform the venipuncture.
- 4. Gently  invert  the  syringe  three  or  four  times  after collecting the  blood  to  mix  the  blood  and  heparin properly.

## 2. Neutrophil isolation

NOTE: Polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) are isolated through density gradient centrifugation followed by hypotonic lysis  of  the  remaining  red  blood  cells  (RBC),  as  previously described 11 with some changes. This method is not mandatory  to  perform  the  screening  assays,  and  can  be replaced as long as the chosen method results in a viability of &gt;97%,  priming  or  activation of &lt;3%  of  the  PMNs, and  yields  enough  cells  for  all  assays,  replicates,  and conditions. Performing these steps under aseptic conditions and using endotoxin-free solutions are mandatory to avoid cell activation.

- 1. Make 12 mL dilutions of 60% and 70% separation media (commercially available; see Table of Materials )  in  50 mL conical tubes.

- 2. Prepare the gradient from bottom to top by adding 4 mL at a time of the 60% dilution over the 70% dilution, using a 5 mL pipette. Do this gently to prevent mixing the interface.
- 3. Carefully layer 12 mL of heparinized blood on top of the density gradient. Centrifuge at 200 x g for 15 min at room temperature.
- NOTE: From this step onward, until PMN activation, all the reagents and tubes used must be kept in a cooler filled with ice.
- 4. Discard the plasma/mononuclear cell layer, then gently transfer the layer above the erythrocyte pellet into two 15 mL conical tubes with approximately 7.5 mL in each. Make  up  the  tube  volume  with  Hank's  balanced  salt solution (HBSS; see Table of Materials ).
- 5. Centrifuge at 300 x g for 5 min at 19 °C.
- 6. Wash the cell pellet with HBSS.
- 1. Discard  the  supernatant  by  pouring  the  tube  and gently resuspend the pellet in 7 mL of HBSS.
- 2. Centrifuge at 300 x g for 5 min at 19 °C to remove all the separation media.
- 7. Perform hypotonic lysis of the remaining RBCs.
- 1. Discard the supernatant and combine the pellets in a single tube.
- 2. Resuspend the RBC/PMN pellet in 3 mL of sterile H2O  and  add  3  mL  of  HBSS  (2x)  within  25  s  to restore the osmolarity. Then, centrifuge at 300 x g for 5 min at 19 °C.
- 3. Repeat steps 2.8.1 and 2.8.2 for a white, erythrocyte-free pellet.
- NOTE: The supernatant must be removed as soon as  possible  to  minimize  the  contact  of  neutrophil with  RBC  breakdown  products.  Alternatively,  the

<!-- image -->

second hypotonic lysis  can  be  replaced  by  gently resuspending the residual RBC layer and removing all  the  supernatant,  as  the  remaining  RBCs  will sediment above the PMN pellet.

- 8. Discard  the  supernatant  by  pouring  the  tube,  gently resuspend the PMNs in the remaining buffer, and transfer them to an ice-cold microtube.
- NOTE: Ensure to annotate the volume while transferring the resuspended cells with a micropipette.
- 9. Transfer  3  x  1  µL  of  the  cell  suspension  to  a  clean glass slide (three wells of 1 µL each) and stain with fast panoptic (see Table of Materials )  for  morphology and purity evaluation 12 .
- 1. To stain with fast panoptic, immerse the slide five times in panoptic fixative n° 1, six times in eosin n° 2, and twice in n° 3, with each immersion lasting 1 s.
- 2. Gently wash the glass slide with distilled water.

- 3. Allow to drain and air-dry.
- 10. Observe  under  a  microscope  and  count  300  random cells in each well, thus differentiating the neutrophils from other granulocytes.
- 11. Transfer 1 µL of the cell suspension to 49 µL of 0.2% trypan blue dye and count the cells using a Neubauer chamber, distinguishing between dead and viable cells.
- 12. Adjust  the  cell  concentration  to  6,667  cells/µL  using a  solution  of  50%  autologous  plasma  and  50%  HBSS supplemented with calcium and magnesium. Divide the 6,667 cells/µL suspension evenly among the microtubes corresponding to the conditions to be tested, including the negative control.

NOTE: Any cell concentration similar to the circulating neutrophils  in  the  model  organism  can  be  used,  but  it is  important  to  use  the  same  cell  concentration  in  all experiments for reproducibility.

## 3. Preparation for neutrophil activation

- 1. In 1.5 mL microtubes, prepare an activation system for each  condition  so  that  the  final  cell  concentration  is

6,600 cells/µL.  For  instance,  to  test  the  effects  of  100 nM fMLP (N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine; see Table of Materials ),  add  5  µL  of  10  µM  fMLP  to  495 µL  of  the  6,667  cell/µL  suspension.  For  the  negative

<!-- image -->

(unstimulated) control, add HBSS containing Ca 2+  and Mg 2+ .

NOTE: To demonstrate this methodology, the following final concentrations  of the stimuli were  used:  100 nM  fMLP,  16  µM  of  fallaxin,  a  naturally  occurring antimicrobial peptide 14 , and 100 nM PMA (phorbol 12myristate 13-acetate) (see Table of Materials ).

- 2. Incubate at 37 °C without rotation.

NOTE:  All  aliquots  for  functional  assays  are  taken from  this  cell  suspension,  hereafter  referred  to  as  the activation system.

## 4. Nitrotetrazolium blue chloride (NBT) assay for evaluating ROS production

- 1. Preparation of NBT working solution: For each experimental condition, prepare an NBT (see Table of Materials ) working solution of 6 mM using the following steps:
- 1. Dissolve  0.0005  g  of  NBT  in  10  µL  of  dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and vortex for at least 15 min.
- 2. Add 90 µL of HBSS Ca 2+ Mg 2+  and vortex up to 2 min.
- NOTE: All steps involving NBT must be performed in the dark.

## 2. Perform NBT slide test.

- 1. After  20  min  of  cell  activation,  gently  mix  the  cell suspension and carefully transfer 2 µL of PMN to a clean glass slide. Incubate for 20 min in a humidified chamber at 37 °C.

NOTE: Do not spread the cell suspension too much over  the  slide;  otherwise  it  may  dry  out  before incubation.

- 2. Add 1 µL of the NBT working solution over the cells and further incubate for 20 min protected from light.
- 3. Dry  the  slide  with  hot  air  and  fix  it  with  a  drop  of methanol in each well for 1 min. Stain with 0.03% safranin (see Table of Materials ) for 1 min.
- 4. Gently wash the glass slide with distilled water.
- 5. Allow  the  slide  to  air-dry  and  observe  under  a microscope.
- 6. Count 100 random cells in each well, differentiating neutrophils with and without formazan deposits.
- 3. Perform NBT spectrophotometry assay.
- 1. After 40  min  of  cell  activation, gently  mix  the cell  suspension  and  transfer  90  µL  of  PMNs  from the  activation  system  to  a  clean  microtube.  Then, carefully  add  20  µL  of  the  6  mM  NBT  solution. Incubate in the dark for 20 min at 37 °C.
- 2. Add 100 µL of 10% Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS; see Table of Materials ) and vortex.
- 3. Sonicate  using  a  tip-sonicator  at  an  amplitude  of 60%, five cycles of 15 s each with 15 s intervals. Centrifuge at 12,000 x g for 5 min.
- 4. Transfer 60 µL of the supernatant to a clear-bottom 96-well  plate  and  measure  the  absorbance  of  the formazan product at 570 nm.

## 5. Phagocytosis assay

- 1. Prepare a 33,000 yeasts/µL suspension for each condition, as described below:
- 1. Add approximately 0.75 mg of dry yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae ; see Table of Materials ) to  200  µL  of  HBSS  Ca 2+ Mg 2+ and

<!-- image -->

incubate in a thermomixer at 100 °C with 500 rpm for at least 15 min.

- 2. Homogenize the mixture by vortexing and transfer 5 µL of yeast suspension to 45 µL of 0.2% trypan blue dye. Count the yeasts using a Neubauer chamber.
- 3. Adjust the concentration of the initial suspension to 33,000 yeast cells/µL using HBSS Ca 2+ Mg 2+ . Keep the suspension on ice until use.
- 2. After  20  min  of  cell  activation,  gently  mix  the  cell suspension and transfer 5 µL of the activation system to 5 µL of the 33,000 yeast/µL Saccharomyces cerevisiae suspension in a new sterile microtube.

NOTE: The neutrophil to yeast ratio is 1:5 (PMN:yeast).

- 3. Immediately transfer 6 µL of the PMN/yeast suspension into three wells of a clean glass slide (2 µL each) and incubate the slide in a humidified chamber for 40 min. NOTE: Do not spread the cell suspension too much over the slide; otherwise, it may dry out before incubation.
- 4. Dry the slide under hot air and stain with fast panoptic, as described in step 2.9 above.
- NOTE:  The  third  step  of  the  fast  panoptic  staining  is critical to the microscopy analysis of the slide. Staining the  slide  for  ≥3  s  at  this  step  can  render  it  unfit  for analysis, since it will be difficult to differentiate yeast from neutrophil nuclear lobes.
- 5. Observe  the  slides  under  the  microscope,  counting 100 random neutrophils of each well and discriminating between PMNs positive and negative for phagocytosis. NOTE:  At  least  one  yeast  particle  within  or  in  direct contact  with  the  PMN  cellular  membrane  indicates  a PMN positive for phagocytosis. If interested in the yeast/ neutrophil  ratio,  count  the  number  of  yeast  particles engulfed aswell.

## 6. Real-time PMN chemotaxis assay

NOTE:  The  migration assay is performed similarly to the protocol described previoulsy 15 , with the following adaptations:

- 1. Prepare  the  chemotactic  gradient  by  adding  160  µL of chemoattractant  (e.g.,  fMLP,  IL-8,  C5,  or  LTB4; see Table  of  Materials )  to  the  lower  chamber  of  an impedance-based real time cell analyzer (RTCA) plate. For negative controls and blanks, add 160 µL of HBSS Ca 2+ Mg 2+ .
- 2. Attach  the  upper  chamber  and  add  25  µL  of  HBSS Ca 2+ Mg 2+ . Incubate at room temperature for at least 1 h to form the chemotactic gradient.
- 3. After  60  min  of  cell  activation,  gently  mix  the  cell suspension and place 60 µL of cell suspension in the upper chamber. Add 60 µL of HBSS Ca 2+ Mg 2+  to the blank.
- 4. Place the RTCA plate and program the RTCA software to measure the cell index (CI) every 60 s for 2 h. NOTE:  The  RTCA  plates  can  be  washed  for  reuse as previously described. In summary, wash the RTCA chambers and electrodes with phosphate-buferred saline (PBS)  three  times,  then  with  type  I  ultrapure  water twice. Incubate the lower and upper chamber with 0.25% trypsin 0.53 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)
- for 40 min. Wash with ultrapure water three times.

## 7. NET suggestive assay

- 1. After  10  min  of  cell  activation,  gently  mix  the  cell suspension and transfer 4 µL of the PMNs from each activation system under evaluation, divided into two wells

<!-- image -->

of a clean glass slide. Incubate in a humidified chamber at 37 °C for 30 min.

- 2. Add 1 µL of DNAse I to one of the wells and incubate for 20 min at 37 °C (in a wet chamber).
- 3. Dry the slide and stain with fast panoptic, as previously described  in  step  2.10  of  the  "neutrophil  isolation" section.
- 4. Evaluate the slides under a microscope.

NOTE: Look for any indication of NET release, characterized  by  the  presence  of  web-like  structures. Once identified,  confirm  if  the  DNAse  I  treatment  was capable  of  removing  such  structures.  This  assay  is suggestive  of  NET  formation,  as  additional  tests  are required to confirm their presence.

## Representative Results

The density-based isolation method used in this study ( Figure

- 1 ) met the criteria for the proposed experiments. Neutrophil

<!-- image -->

parameters  obtained  from  this  method  included  viability ≥98%,  purity  ≥94%,  and  cell  yield  ≥1.5  x  10 7 , with  no detectable  activation  by  the  screening  tests.  Two  relevant steps in the isolation of PMNs are anticoagulation and RBC removal. Keeping the anticoagulated blood tube or syringe at a gentle rocking before layering over the density gradient and choosing an RBC removal method to prevent both activation and  contamination  can  influence  the  experiment  yield  and reproducibility.

To assess the functional overview of neutrophil function, a workflow was developed that allowed the proposed screening assays to be performed with at least two researchers in an average time of 4 h, with 1 h of activation and 2 h of real-time migration monitoring, as shown in Figure 2 .

(R1) starts the PMN isolation process, followed by cell concentration adjustment and activation system incubation, while in parallel, researcher 2 (R2) prepares the materials to carry out the next assays, which are divided between the two: R1 performs phagocytosis, NET, and spectrophotometric NBT assays; R2 performs real-time migration and NBT slide tests.

The classic NBT assay 17  was optimized for both slide and spectrophotometric  assessment  of  the  formazan  formation resulting from the reaction of NBT with the ROS generated by PMNs. The spectrophotometric assay allowed for relative quantification among conditions, while the microscopy assay was  useful  for  descriptive  and  semi-quantitative  analysis, evaluating the regularity of crystal distribution, morphology, and number of cells containing formazan. The results of the spectrophotometric assay are shown in Figure 3A , indicating that  100  nM  PMA  induced  elevated  ROS  production  (in an  average  ratio  of  3:2:1)  compared  to  fMLP  and  control groups. The NBT slide test results ( Figure 3B ) corroborated the  spectrophotometric  results,  also  showing  PMA  as  the most  intense  ROS  production-inducing  stimulus  compared to  fMLP  ( Figure  3C ),  as  previously  demonstrated  by  the direct measurement of ROS by cytometry 18 . Regarding cell counting,  the  number  of  neutrophils  containing  formazan

crystals  showed  a  ratio  of  7:4:1  in  the  PMA:fMLP:control conditions,  also  revealing  different  formazan  distribution patterns  between  fMLPs  and  PMA-activated  PMNs;  fMLP treatment  resulted  in  intensively  activated  individual  cells, while  PMA  induced  the  formation  of  formazan  crystals scattered throughout the cytoplasm in the majority of PMNs.  Furthermore,  a  few  morphological  characteristics that differentiated the conditions were observed, such as  expressive  cell  aggregation  after  PMA  treatment.  The absence  of  such  typical  activation  characteristics  and  low levels  of  formazan  on  the  control  group  indicated  that  the resting state was not significantly disturbed. Therefore, the NBT assay proved to be a simple, inexpensive, and reliable test  for  neutrophil  ROS  production  that  can  be  used  to overview  the  capacity  and  intensity  of  a  given  stimulus  to induce ROS production.

The phagocytosis slides were used to determine the phagocytosis rate as a percentage of neutrophils performing phagocytosis,  as  shown  in Figure  4 . Although  both  100 nM  fMLP  and  16  µM  antimicrobial  peptide  induced  an apparently  increased  yeast  engulfment,  the  difference  was

not  statistically  significant  until  the  dual  stimulation,  which significantly  enhanced  the  phagocytosis  compared  to  the control  group  and  might  suggest  a  response  upon  dual stimulation.

Figure 4: Phagocytosis test. Neutrophils were evaluated by their phagocytosis capacity (counting of neutrophils containing yeast). Although the exposure to 100 nM fMLP or a 16 µM antimicrobial peptide prior to yeast incubation enhanced the phagocytosis compared to the control group, ( A ) the increase was not statistically significant. Interestingly, an initial incubation with fMLP, followed by addition of the antimicrobial peptide, resulted in significantly enhanced phagocytosis in human neutrophils (asterisk between CTRL and the fMLP+ antimicrobial peptide).

An  example  of  real-time  cell  migration  results  is  shown  in Figure  5 ,  exhibiting  the  well-known  chemotactic  effect  of 100 nM fMLP on neutrophils . The cell migration kinetics was

adjusted to the Gompertz model, enabling the comparison of its parameters.

Finally,  a  simple  optical  microscopy  test  suggestive  of  the presence  of  NET  is  presented,  in  which  the  PMNs  are stained with fast panoptic. It is possible to observe that for some specific NET-inducing stimuli, such as PMA or some antimicrobial peptides, even after a short activation time (1 h)  it  is  possible  to  observe  filamentous  web-like  structures near the cells, while this is not possible in other conditions like the negative control and fMLP ( Figure 6 ). To better support

this claim, DNase I was added after 40 min of cell activation with 100 nm PMA or an antimicrobial peptide, removing the NET-like structures ( Figure 6 ).  Although this method is not suitable for NET characterization and can be influenced by artifacts, it is a cheap, simple, and interesting starting point to justify further investments in analyzing NETs, especially in contexts wherein the effects of the stimulus are unknown or poorly described.

Figure 6: NET formation suggestive assay. A qualitative analysis of panoptic-stained neutrophils after 1 h of activation over a glass slide may indicate NET release. CTRL ( A,B ) and fMLP ( C,D ) groups did not show any indication of NET release, while activation with PMA ( E-H ) induced the formation of NET-like structures that were degraded by DNase I treatment ( I-L ). Investigation of the effects of an antimicrobial peptide on the neutrophils showed that such a stimulus might be able to elicit NET release, since the slides presented the NET-like structures ( M-P ) that were degraded by DNase I ( Q-T ). Red arrows point to NET-like structures. Scale bars: 10 µm. Please click here to view a larger version of this figure.

## Discussion

Neutrophils  are  highly  dynamic  and  responsive  cells  that are short-lived and cannot yet be cryopreserved 19 , making investigations into their biology challenging. Therefore, it is essential  to  follow  careful  steps  to  obtain  viable,  enriched, and resting neutrophils 11,20 . This study employed a densitybased  isolation technique that emphasizes  gentle and

minimal manipulation, as well as the use of low temperatures until the activation step. Additionally, blood processing must occur  within  30  min  after  venipuncture  and  be  stored  at room temperature. The present work presents an option to diminish manipulation stress and experiment time. To further simplify the process, we introduced a new step (as an option) in  the  protocol,  which  involves  removing  RBCs  by  gentle

<!-- image -->

resuspension and aspiration of the RBC layer after a single hemolysis  procedure.  This  step  reduces  the  manipulation stress  and  experiment  time,  as  it  removes  the  majority  of RBCs  with  only  one  hypotonic  hemolysis  step.  However, it should  be  noted  that  operator  skills  greatly  affect  the effectiveness  of  this  step,  and  it  may  not  always  entirely remove RBCs. Furthermore, RBC aspiration can lead to a loss  of  neutrophils,  but  this  does  not  affect  the  yield,  as more neutrophils were initially  recovered  from  the  gradient when  collecting  closer  to  the  RBC  layer.  Therefore,  RBC aspiration is recommended if the assays do not require the highest possible purity, or if the operator has had consistently good results. For the screening tests presented here, a small amount of contaminant RBCs (&lt;3%) would not interfere with the results.

To  ensure  that  all  the  procedures  are  performed  in  due time, including reagent preparation, a workflow is presented ( Figure  2 )  that  details  the  timeline  and  division  of  tasks between  two  researchers.  After  all  functional  assays  are finished,  the  remaining  cells  can  be  prepared  for  further molecular investigations, like omics studies by cell lysis with proper lysis buffer and storage.

## ROS production

Respiratory  burst  is  a  hallmark  of  neutrophil  priming  and activation 18,21 , and evaluating ROS production is a common method used to estimate the activation status of neutrophils. This study evaluated ROS production using two approaches: optical microscopy and spectrophotometry.

The  NBT  test  is  a  well-known  approach  to  assess  the respiratory  burst  in  neutrophils 22,23 .  Two  commonly  used methods are the optical microscopy-based (or slide test) and spectrophotometry-based  assays 24,25,26 .  Although  optical microscopy allows for the visualization of details at the cell

level, it is prone to user bias. Therefore, the NBT slide test serves as a qualitative complement to the spectrophotometric assay  regarding  phenotypic  features,  such  as  formazan formation patterns, intensity, and cell aggregation.

The critical steps for both the NBT slide and spectrophotometric tests are the NBT and formazan complete solubilization. Contrary to the manufacturer's recommendations,  NBT  does  not  dissolve  well  in  water. However,  homogenizing  NBT  in  DMSO  for  at  least  15 min  and  then  adding  water/HBSS  and  vortexing  for  2  min provides complete solubilization. In addition, to analyze the absorbance of formazan, two critical steps must be achieved: (1) release of formazan crystals from cells by PMN lysis and (2) complete solubilization of formazan crystals. Both steps were achieved by treating the cell pellet with 10% SDS, as recently suggested 27 , followed by sonication and absorbance analysis of the supernatant at 570 nm.

Furthermore,  the  NBT  results  of  the  negative  and  positive control  groups  are  the  first  step  of  the  screening  to  be assessed.  This  step  must  show  a  remarkable  difference, since ROS production evaluation through formazan indicates whether the isolation process might have been responsible for unwanted changes in the resting status of the cells either by stimulation or inhibition.

Other  methods,  such  as  cytochrome  c  reduction 28   or  flow cytometry 29 analysis,  are  often  used  for  ROS  detection; however considering a screening approach, their application requires  a  longer  experiment  time,  the  use  of  specific markers, and expensive instruments. Chemiluminescence of luminol/isoluminol  is  a  fast  and  cost-effective  method  for detecting ROS while also allowing the differentiation of intraand extracellular ROS. However, a luminometer is required for  this  method 30,31 .  Although  instrument  cost  could  be

circumvented by the use of a facility,  it  would  still  be  unfit for a screening analysis performed simultaneously with other assays.

## Phagocytosis

The PMN/yeast incubation provides an overview of neutrophil phagocytosis capacity and efficacy by counting the number of  neutrophils  performing  phagocytosis  and  the  number  of yeasts engulfed per neutrophil. However, as the yeast particle itself is an activation signal, comparing the control group with pre-treated PMN constitutes a dual stimulation system, which may not display significant changes, as shown in the CTRL versus  fMLP-treated  PMN  ( Figure  4 ). Nevertheless,  this assay is  useful  in  indicating  whether  a  potential  modulator would generate any impact on phagocytosis. A novel antimicrobial  peptide  was  tested  using  this  assay,  and  the results  indicate  an  interesting  potential  response  to  this combination of stimuli, which has recently been discussed as needed for efficient activation 32 .

The  critical  step  for  this assay  is  the  staining,  as  the analysis becomes unreliable if the slide is kept on panoptic No. 3 (hematoxylin) for ≥3 s. This is because the yeast  cells  and  the  neutrophil  nuclear  lobes  cannot  be distinguished  from  each  other.  Moreover,  this  approach allows the morphology analysis of neutrophils after exposure to modulators. Flow cytometry is another efficient technique to analyze phagocytosis 33 , although it has limitations through the difficulty in discriminating between membrane-bound and engulfed particles and other factors related to the proposed screening  set,  as  discussed  in  the  previous  topic.  The same limitation is observed in the method described herein, although this is  to  be  considered  as  an  initial  screening  to guide follow-up studies.

## Real-time migration

The real-time screening protocol was optimized to evaluate the migration capacity of PMNs. Although a previous study suggested  that  coating  the  underside  of  the  RTCA  plate was  needed  for  the  migration  assay  to  show  a  difference between the negative control and IL-8 treatment 15 , this study showed high confidence interval (CI) values for fMLP-treated cells  without  the  addition  of  coating  agents.  The  results presented high reproducibility with significant migration from 12  min  onward.  Furthermore,  curve  fitting  analysis  of  the obtained migration data can reveal parameters, such as cell index maximum and increase and decrease slope, that are useful for understanding the dynamics of migration, and may depend on concentration or differ between conditions. The best  fitting  for  neutrophil  migration  curves  ( Figure  5 )  was to  the  adjusted  Gompertz  function 34 ,  showing  that  fMLP increases the maximum cell index and the increased slope.

Special attention is required to avoid bubbles in the RTCA system  as  they  can  block  the  cells  passing  through  the electrodes,  compromising  the  experiment.  A  limiting  factor is the high cost of the plates. Although cheaper techniques analyze cell migration, they lack good reproducibility or are difficult and time-consuming, such as the Boyden chamber. Therefore, RTCA is a reliable migration analysis compatible with the other screening tests presented here.

## NETs

Lastly, a promising, easy, and low-cost assay for a preliminary evaluation of NET formation was developed using optical  microscopy.  It  was  derived  from  the  observation  of phagocytosis slides, in which PMA, a specific NET-inducing stimulus tested for its effect on phagocytosis capacity, also induced  a  web-like  structure  formation  compared  to  the CTRL and fMLP groups. This work hypothesized that those structures could indicate NET release. Such a hypothesis was

tested by treating the samples with DNase I after activation, where no filamentous structures were found in PMA-activated neutrophils. The assumption that such structures are likely to be NETs is based on the fact that PMA is cited as a wellknown inducer of NET formation 36,37 , the finding of similar structures by fluorescence microscopy using specific markers for  NETs 38,39 and  the  degradation  of  NETs  catalyzed  by DNase  I 40,41 . It is important  to  emphasize  that  this  is not  a  method  for  the  confirmation  of  NET  formation,  but just  a  preliminary  screening  that  suggests  the  presence  of NETs.  Although  this  test  has  limitations,  as  NET  can  be confused with staining artifacts, it serves a relevant purpose in suggesting NET formation in a fast and low-cost screening that  can  be  performed  together  with  other  functional  tests. Once  detected  as  possibly  relevant  to  the  study  being screened,  NETs  can  be  further  evaluated  by  confocal  or electron microscopy 42 , as discussed later.

In  our  lab,  novel  antimicrobial  peptides,  also  likely  to  have immunomodulatory activities, are frequently evaluated by this set  of  screening  assays  to  better  guide  further  analysis  of the effects of some peptides on human neutrophils, as some show interesting ROS 43 , phagocytosis, migration and/or NET modulating properties.

In conclusion,  the  NeutroFun  Screen  offers  a  valuable tool for identifying potential modulators of the normal density neutrophil activity from a large number of untested compounds. However, it is important to note that this method only  serves  as  a  preliminary  screening.  After  this  initial screening, more expensive, advanced, and time-consuming methodologies  can  be  directed  to  specific  functions  or pathways suggested by these first results for data validation. For  ROS  production,  phagocytosis,  and  NET  formation, there  are  alternative  methods  for  data  validation  and  to

obtain  further  quantitative  results.  NET  visualization  and quantification can be performed through immunofluorescence microscopy  analysis,  which  determines  the  presence  and overlap  of  extracellular  DNA  and  granule  proteins,  such as  myeloperoxidase  and  neutrophil  elastase,  as  described in detail recently 42 . ROS  play  different  crucial  roles  in many  biological  processes,  and  therefore  their  study  is highly widespread and diverse. Among the most established methodologies are those that make use of antibodies, such as  the  enzyme-linked  immunosorbent  assay  (ELISA)  and immunoblotting of luminescence, or fluorescence detectionsuch  as  flow  cytometry  of  cells  under  different  labelingthrough DCFDA, EPR spectroscopy, and enzymatic activity measurements 44 . Similarly, robust phagocytosis evaluation is also done in several ways; the alternative methods include flow  cytometry  alone 45,46   or  combined  with  fluorescence microscopy 47 .  The  real-time  cell  migration  described  is  a robust  and  sufficient  assay  that  does  not  require  further validation and presents parameters that other methodologies cannot  contemplate.  Other  combinations  of  such  methods might better suit specific scenarios, but in summary, this represents a fast and  affordable combination  that encompasses many neutrophil activities.

In  summary,  this  study  aims  to  provide  a  set  of  assays consisting  of  simple,  fast,  and  low-cost  methodologies  to evaluate  multiple  neutrophil  responses  to  novel  molecules and  conditions  as  a  way  to  better  direct  efforts  toward advanced  methodologies.  As  major  limitations,  the  results from ROS,  NET,  and  phagocytosis  assays  should be considered preliminary and need further validation by more specific and elaborate assays, and those that rely on nonautomated microscopy cell count are prone to unconscious bias.
