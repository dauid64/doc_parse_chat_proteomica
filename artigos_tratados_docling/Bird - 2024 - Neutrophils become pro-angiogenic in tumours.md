## Neutrophils become pro-angiogenic in tumours

A recent study in Science may explain why neutrophil infiltration of tumours is generally associated with poor clinical outcomes. The researchers show that tumour-infiltrating neutrophils undergo irreversible reprogramming to adopt a long-lived and pro-angiogenic state that supports tumour growth.

Diverse neutrophil subtypes have been described in cancer, but their relationships and functions were unclear. Ng et al. explored this heterogeneity in a mouse model of pancreatic cancer. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of intratumoural neutrophils identified three distinct transcriptional profiles (denoted T1, T2 and T3). T1 neutrophils had an immature phenotype, whereas T2 cells had a mature phenotype. RNA velocity analysis suggested that both immature neutrophils and mature neutrophils enter tumours and temporarily become T1 and T2 cells, respectively. Both T1 and T2 cells can further differentiate into T3 neutrophils; thus, the T3 population has a maturation status between that of T1 and T2 cells.

Analysis by ATACseq confirmed that increased chromatin accessibility for genes upregulated in T3 neutrophils is initiated in T1 and T2 subsets and is reinforced by transcription factor activity as they transition

to the T3 state. Using multiparameter flow cytometry, the authors were able to define cell surface markers that could be used to distinguish the three neutrophil populations. There was enrichment for dcTRAIL-R1 expression in T3 neutrophils but not in any other neutrophil subset inside or outside the tumour or in other myeloid cell types, and the maturation marker CD101 could be used to separate T1 neutrophils from T2   neutrophils in the dcTRAIL-R1 population.

Immature or mature neutrophils cultured in tumour-conditioned media or adoptively transferred into tumour-bearing mice rapidly acquired the T3 gene signature and dcTRAIL-R1 expression, transitioning via the T1 or T2 stage. Importantly, the T3 phenotype was stable and did not revert in the absence of tumour-derived factors and resulted in prolonged survival of tumour neutrophils. Pulse labelling with BrdU confirmed that neutrophil dcTRAIL-R1 expression is initiated on entry into the tumour and steadily increases, with the highest expression 15 days after labelling, suggestive of an unusually long lifespan for the T3 subset.

To gain a better understanding of how neutrophil localization in the tumour may affect their function and survival, the authors performed spatial analysis. T3 cells

were found more frequently in hypoxic and glycolytic regions of the tumour, whereas T1 and T2 cells were generally located near the tumour edges and away from hypoxic and glycolytic niches. This spatial segregation is consistent with the finding that T3 neutrophils have transcriptional and epigenetic profiles that are enriched for hypoxia, glycolysis and angiogenesis pathways. The data suggest that T3 cells migrate into and occupy the specialized hypoxic-glycolytic tumour niche, adapting to the tumour environment by upregulating genes that support their survival in these niches.

Prior studies have suggested that neutrophils support tumour growth by promoting tumour angiogenesis. Consistent with this, T3 neutrophils had the highest transcript and protein expression of vascular endothelial growth factor-α (VEGFα) and had a greater capacity to induce blood vessel formation in vivo than T1 or T2 neutrophils. Moreover, when T3 cells were co-injected with cancer cells, tumours grew rapidly. Some tumour growth still occurred after co-injection with other neutrophil types but it was delayed, probably reflecting a period of differentiation into the T3 subtype. T3 cell-induced accelerated tumour growth lasted for several weeks, even after T3 neutrophils had disappeared, and was abolished by neutralization of VEGFα, which suggests that the T3 neutrophils generated long-lasting vascular remodelling in the tumour.

Finally, reanalysis of previously published scRNA-seq datasets from other mouse cancer models and from human pancreatic cancer cohorts revealed the three neutrophil subsets in tumours and not in adjacent normal tissue, with a pro-angiogenic subset mapping to the T3 classification. Moreover, the T3 neutrophil signature was consistently associated with poorer overall survival in two pancreatic cancer cohorts and some other solid tumours. Collectively, the data suggest that tumour-educated T3 neutrophils drive tumour progression in both mouse cancers and human cancers.
