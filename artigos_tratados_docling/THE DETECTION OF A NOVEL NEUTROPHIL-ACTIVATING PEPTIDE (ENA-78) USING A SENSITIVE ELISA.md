## ABSTRACT

Neutrophil elicitation  into tissue is an essential  element o f   the host defense in response to various stimuli, including, tissue injury, infection, or cancer. This event has gained renewed interest with the discovery of  a family o f   small polypeptides (40 kD).  The salient features of  these cytokines are the presence of  four cysteine amino acids (first two separated by one amino acid; C-X-C) and their ability  to induce neutrophil chemotaxis and activation.  Recently, our laboratories have discovered a new  member  of  this C-X-C chemotactic cytokine supergene family, neutrophilactivating  peptide,  ENA-78. ENA-78  shares  significant amino  acid  sequence homology with neutrophil activating peptide-2 (NAP-2; 53%), growth regulated oncogene/melanoma growth stimulatory activity (GROa; 52%), and IL-8 (22%).  In addition, ENA-78 appears to activate neutrophils through the IL-8 receptor.  Since both in vitro  and in vivo biological fluids may  contain an array of  chemotactic cytokines that may be relevant to the activation and chemotaxis of  neutrophils, we have developed a highly specific and sensitive sandwich ELISA for the detection of ENA-78.

## INTRODUCTION

The accumulation  of  inflammatory  leukocytes in tissue is a hallmark of  acute inflammation. Although  the  polymorphonuclear  leukocyte  (PMN)  is  the predominant inflammatory leukocyte recruited in response to acute injury, this cell may also be associated with a number of  more chronic inflammatory disorders. The sequence  of events  resulting  in  the  elicitation  of PMNs  from  the  vascular compartment of  the post-capillary  venule into the tissue interstitium  are essential to the pathogenesis  o f   acute  inflammation. The migration  o f   PMNs initially occurs  with

adherence to the vascular endothelium,  followed  by  activation,  transenao;helial diapedesis, proteolytic digestion o f   the basement membrane extracellular matrix, and chemotaxis along established chemotactic gradients. This latter event is due to the generation o f   chemotactic  factors followed by subsequent mobilization o f   leukocytes in reaction  to a  chemoattractant. This event is an essential element  of  the  host defense in response to various stimuli, including, tissue injury, infection, or cancer. Previous  studies  have  identified  a  supergene  family  (C-X-C)  o f chemotactic polypeptide cytokines, that include interleukin-8 (IL- 8 ; 1-4).  These peptides have in common the ability to cause neutrophil activation and chemotaxis.

Recently, our laboratories have described the isolation and complete primary structure o f   a novel neutrophil activating peptide (ENA-78)  from human pulmonary type II-like epithelial cell line, A549 cells (5). ENA-78 is a 78-amino acid peptide with a  molecular  weight  of  8.357 kD  and  has  four  cysteine  amino  acids  positioned identically to other members o f   the IL-8 supergene family.  ENA-78 has 22%, 52%, and  53%  amino  acid sequence  homology with  IL-8, growth  regulated oncogene/melanoma growth stimulatory activity (GROa), and neutrophil activating peptide-2 (NAP-2))  respectively (5).  In a similar manner as IL-8, ENA-78 stimulates neutrophil migration and activation. Moreover, it appears that ENA-78, IL-8 , NAP-2, and GROa all act through the same receptor on neutrophils (5).

In this manuscript, we demonstrate a specific and sensitive method for the detection o f ENA-78 from cellular supernatants using a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The ENA-78 ELISA has a threshold sensitivity o f   100 pg/ml. In  addition,  this  ELISA  was  specific  for  ENA-78  and  failed  to  detect interleukin-1  (IL-la and IL-lp), interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IRAP), interleukin4 (IL-4), interleukin-6  (IL-6), interleukin-7 (IL-7), IL-8, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-l), transforming growth factor-f3 (TGFP), tumor  necrosis factora (TNFa),  GROa, NAP-2, or gamma-interferon-inducible  peptide-10 (YIP-10).

prior  to  passage 4. Human pulmonary fibroblasts were isolated from patients undergoing thoracotomy for reasons other than interstitial  lung disease as previously described (7), cultured to confluence in 60 mm culture plates (Corning  Glass Works, Corning, NJ)  in EMEM (Whitaker Biomedical Products, Walkersville, MD) containing 1  mM glutamine,  25 mM HEPES, 100  units/ml penicillin 100  n g / d  streptomycin, 1% non-essential amino acids (Gibco  Laboratories,  Grand Island, NY), and 10%  fetal calf serum (FCS),  and used prior to passage 6.  Renal cortical epithelial  cells were isolated from patients undergoing nephrectomy for hypernephroma as previously described (8), cultured to confluence in 60 mm culture plates (Corning  Glass Works, Corning, NJ) in EMEM (Whitaker Biomedical Products, Walkersville, MD) containing 1  mM glutamine, 25 mM HEPES, 100 units/ml penicillin 100 n g / d  streptomycin,  1% nonessential amino acids (Gibco Laboratories, Grand Island, NY),  and  10% fetal calf serum (FCS), and used prior to passage 6.  Pulmonary epithelial cells (A549) were purchased from ATCC (Rockville, MD), cultured as previously described (9). On day of use endothelial cells, pulmonary fibroblasts, pulmonary epithelial cells, and renal cortical epithelial cells were cultured in the presence o f   0.5%, O % , O % , and 0% serum, respectively.  Human monocytes (106 cells/ml) and neutrophils (5 X 106 cells/ml) were isolated from peripheral blood as previously described (7-9), cultured in 35 mm plates (Corning Glass Works, Corning, NJ) with RPMI-1640  (Whitaker Biomedical Products,  Walkersville,  MD),  1 mM  glutamine, 25  mM  HEPES,  100 units/ml penicillin, 100 ng/ml  streptomycin (Hazelton Research Products, Denver, PA), and viability was greater than 95%.

Generation of ENA-78 Antibodies: Rabbit Anti-human ENA-78 antibodies were produced using a modification of  our previously described method (10). Briefly, ENA-78 (5) was first administered in multiple intradermal injections o f   20 pg (total) emulsified with complete  Freund's adjuvant. This procedure  was repeated in 10  days using 20 pg of  ENA-78 emulsified in incomplete Freund's adjuvant.  The rabbit was bled 10  days later with antiserum isolated and heat inactivated. A direct ELISA was then performed to establish the efficacy of  the rabbit antiserum to detect human ENA-78  as  follows: ELISA  (96  wells) plates  (Nunc-Immuno Plate  Maxisorb, Neptune, NJ) were coated with 50 pl of ENA-78 diluted 1  pg/ml in coating buffer [borate-buffered  saline  (50 mM H3BO3, 120 mM NaCl, pH 8.6)]  overnight at 4OC. The plates were then washed three times with 200 pl of  wash-buffer (phosphate-buffered saline [PBS] containing 0.05% v/v Tween-20),  followed by blocking the plates with 200 p1 of  a solution containing PBS and 2% v/v  goat serum for 1  hr at 370C.  The plates were washed three times with wash-buffer and 50 p1 of  rabbit anti-human ENA-78 serum serially diluted (1:lO  to 1:10,000,000) in wash-buffer containing 2% v/v goat serum was placed in duplicate in each o f   the wells, and incubated  for 1  hr at 37OC.  The plates were washed three times with wash-buffer followed by blocking the plates with a solution containing PBS and 2% v/v goat serum for 1  hr at 37OC.

The plates were washed three times with wash-buffer followed by the addition o f   100 pl of k400 v/v goat anti-rabbit  peroxidase (Vector  Laboratories Inc., Burlingame,  CA) and incubated for 30 mins at 37OC.  The plates were washed three times with washbuffer, followed by  the  addition  of  100 pl  of  peroxidase substrate [0.67 mg/ml orthophenylenediamine dichloride (Dako, Carinteria, CA)  in 25 mM citrate/  phosphate pH 5.0, and 0.0002% v/v hydrogen peroxide], color development proceeded for 6 mins at room temperature  and stopped by the addition  of 50 pl of   3 M H2SO4. The absorbance was measured at 490 nm on a Biotek-ELISA reader, and 1: 1 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 titer  of rabbit  anti-human ENA-78 serum  resulted  in  a  significant absorbance over the negative control.  The polyclonal antibodies  were purified from this  high  titer  serum  using  a  protein  A-agarose column  (Pierce, Rockford, a), followed by biotinylating a portion o f   the polyclonal antibodies with NHS-LC-biotin (Pierce, Rockford, IL ) according to manufacturer's directions.  Unbound biotin was separated from bound biotin by using a Centricon 30 (Amicon, Danvers, MA).

ENA-78 LISA; E The sandwich ENA-78 ELISA was preformed using a modification of  our previously described method (10).  Briefly, concentrations o f   both purified capture and detection antibodies were varied  until optimal concentrations were determined for the detection o f   a fixed concentration  o f   human ENA-78.  Subsequent studies were performed with these optimal concentrations of  capture and detection antibodies.  ELISA plates (Nunc-Immuno  Plate Maxisorb, Neptune, NJ) were coated with 50  pl/well  of  ENA-78 antibody diluted  to 3.2 pg/ml  in coating buffer and incubated overnight at 4OC. The plates were then washed three times with 200 d/well of wash-buffer, followed by blocking the plates with 200 d/well of  a solution containing PBS and 2% bovine serum albumin for 1  hr at 37OC.  The plates were washed three times with 200 dl/well  o f   wash-buffer, followed by the addition  o f 50 pl in duplicate of  either a ENA-78 standard curve (1  pg/ml  to 50 ng/ml  diluted in wash-buffer supplemented with 2% FCS), diluted cytokines (0.1 ng/ml to 10 ng/ml diluted in wash-buffer supplemented with 2% FCS), or cell-derived conditioned media (NEAT, 1:5, and l : l O ) , and incubated for 1  hr at 3 7 O C .   The plates were  washed three times with 200 pl/well o f   wash-buffer, followed by the addition o f   50 pl/well o f biotinylated ENA-78 diluted to 6 pg/ml in wash-buffer supplemented with 2% FCS. After incubating  for 45 mins, the plates were washed three times with 200 pl/well o f wash-buffer,  followed by the addition of  100 pl/well of 1:5000 diluted avidin-HRP (Dako, Carinteria,  CA)  in wash-buffer  supplemented  with 2% FCS, and incubated for 30  mins. at 37OC. The plates were washed three times with 200 pl/well  of  washbuffer, followed by  the addition  of 100 p1  o f peroxidase substrate [0.67 mg/ml orthophenylenediamine dichloride (Dako, Carinteria,CA) in 25 mM citrate/  phosphate pH 5.0, and 0.0002% v/v hydrogen peroxide], color development proceeded for 6 mins at room temperature and was stopped with the addition o f 50 pl/well of 3M HzSO4. The absorbance of the color development  was then measured

## RESULTS AND  DISCUSSION

After establishing that our ENA-78 antiserum at a dilution of 1: 1 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 detected antigenic ENA-78 by  direct ELISA,  the polyclonal IgG fraction of  the antiserum was purified  using a  protein A-agarose column and  an aliquot was biotinylated  for use as detection  antibody. To prove whether our ENA-78 ELISA was reproducible and efficacious for the detection  o f   antigenic ENA-78, we performed 12 independent ELISA experiments.

concentration  from 0.001 ng/ml  to 50 ng/ml is shown in Figure 1. The absorbance measured  in  the  presence  or  absence  of ENA-78  ranged  from  the  negative control/absence of  ENA-78 (0.279kO.003) to 50 ng/ml of ENA-78 (1.46(H0.100).  The lower threshold limit for significant detection of  ENA-78 over either background or the next  preceding absorbance was 0.100  ng/ml  (p=O.OOOl), suggesting that  the sensitivity for  the detection o f   ENA-78 was 100  pg/ml. Furthermore, when antigenic ENA-78 was placed in either FCS or human plasma as compared to dilution-buffer, the detection of  antigenic ENA-78 by ELISA was unaltered (data not shown). This ELISA offered the advantage of  greater sensitivity o f   measuring ENA-78 protein as compared to a neutrophil  chemotactic  bioassay (5).

Since it  was  apparent  that  our  ENA-78 ELISA  was  reproducible  for  the detection  of antigenic ENA-78.  We next determined  whether t h i s ELISA was specific on l y for ENA-78. As shown in Table I, ENA-78, IL-la, IL-lp, IRAF',  IL-4,

IL-6,  IL-7, IL-8, MCP-1, TGFP, TNFa, GROa, NAP-2, YIp-10 were analyzed for their ability to react with either capture or detection polyclonal antibodies  in the ENA-78 ELISA (experimental n=3). All of  the cytokines, with the exception  o f   ENA-78, failed to be detected, as compared to background/negative control.  These data suggested that the ENA-78 ELEA was specific  for the detection  of  antigenic  human ENA-78.

Our laboratory  and  others  have  previously  demonstrated  the  ability  o f monocyte, neutrophils, pulmonary epithelial cells, renal epithelial cells, pulmonary fibroblasts, and endothelial cells to produce IL-8 in response to either exogenous or endogenous stimuli (147-9). Based on these observations we determined whether these same cells would respond to these agonists and produce detectable levels of antigenic ENA-78. As shown in  Table I1  (NA=not assessed),  these cells were stimulated in the presence or absence o f LPS (100 ng/ml), IL-1P (2 ng/ml), or TNFa (2 ng/ml) for 24 hrs, supernatants  were isolated

and  analyzed  for  the  presence of ENA-78 (experimental n=3). Renal  cortical epithelial cells stimulated with either LPS, IL-1P, TNFa resulted in significant  levels of ENA-78 as compared to unstimulated negative control, 255f55 pg/ml, 9,806k1252, 6,212k-1652 pg/ml,  respectively. In  addition,  pulmonary  epithelial  cells (3,233 pg/ml), endothelial cells (686k121 pg/ml))  and pulmonary fibroblasts (3,987k1366 pg/ml) treated with IL-lp produced significant levels of ENA-78 as compared to unstimulated  controls. Both pulmonary epithelial cells and fibroblasts had  the capacity to  constitutively produce ENA-78,  596S7 pg/ml  and 706f61 pg/ml, respectively. Furthermore,  both  monocytes (471f100 pg/ml)  and  neutrophils (685f166) produced significant  levels  of ENA-78 in response to LPS stimulation.

These studies demonstrate  the efficacy and reproducibility of  a novel ENA-78 ELISA utilizing polyclonal capture and biotinylated antibodies with the detection sensitivity of 100 pg/ml. The ability to measure specific antigenic ENA-78 from cellular  cultures  is  important  since this  will  allow  future  studies  to  begin  to understand potential pharmacologic regulation of ENA-78 production  by these cells. Furthermore, the use of  an ENA-78 ELISA will allow the detection  of  antigenic ENA78  from biologically relevant fluids, such as bronchoalveolar  lavage fluid  from
