Short title: Heparin induces NET formation

Key words: Heparin, Neutrophil extracellular trap, Enoxaparin, Fondaparinux, heparan sulfate, vital NETs, lytic NETs

## Abstract

Heparin is used extensively as an anticoagulant in a broad range of diseases and procedures, however, its biological effects are not limited to coagulation and remain incompletely understood. Heparin usage can lead to the life threatening complication known as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), caused by the development of antibodies against heparin/PF4 complexes. Here we demonstrate the ability of heparin to induce neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). NETs occurred with cell lysis and death, but live neutrophils releasing extracellular DNA strands, known as vital NETs, also occurred abundantly. Formation of NETs was time and dose dependent, and required reactive oxygen species (ROS) and neutrophil elastase (NE). Other compounds related to heparin such as low molecular weight heparin, fondaparinux, and heparan sulfate either failed to induce NETs, or did so to a much lesser extent. Our findings suggest the ability of heparin to directly induce NET formation should be considered in the context of heparin treatment and HIT pathogenesis.

## Introduction

The naturally occurring polysaccharide heparin is a widely used anticoagulant that was discovered over 100 years ago. Heparin is most commonly isolated from porcine intestine and consists of chains of repeating, highly sulfated disaccharide units of variable length (1). Unlike the closely related and ubiquitously expressed polysaccharide heparan sulfate, endogenous heparin is only expressed in mast cells. Due to its diverse nature, heparin is known to cause unpredictable side effects, one of the most serious of which is heparin induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). In this condition, heparin paradoxically leads to excessive coagulation due to the development of antibodies against platelet factor 4 (PF4) and heparin complexes, which leads to activation of platelets and other cells and encourages thrombi formation (2).

Neutrophils are thought to play a key role in HIT pathology. PF4/heparin immune complexes can activate neutrophils through FcγRIIa, causing them to aggregate with activated platelets and release neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) that promote thrombi stability (3,4). NETs occur when neutrophils are stimulated under a wide range of different conditions and stimuli. Under phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) stimulation, NET formation is triggered due to ROS generation by NAPDH oxidase (NOX) (5). This leads to activation of the serine protease neutrophil elastase (NE) which disrupts the cell nuclear membrane and causes decondensation of chromatin, resulting in mixing of DNA with neutrophil granule and cytosolic proteins (6). NE then acts to cleave the pore forming protein gasdermin D, which facilitates breakdown of the cell membrane and release of extracellular traps containing DNA, histones, and granule proteins (7). The enzyme PAD4 is thought to play a role in the nuclear decondensation stage of this process, however recent evidence for this has been conflicting, with some studies showing no requirement of PAD4 in NET formation (8,9). Alternate pathways of NET formation in response to bacteria have been described in which DNA is released from the cell without cell death. In this case, DNA containing vesicles are thought to be transported to the cell surface and released without inducing cell lysis. This mechanism of NET formation is often referred to as vital NETosis or vital NET formation, and can occur independently of NOX activity, but is thought to rely on NE and PAD4 (10,11).

Heparin has been shown to facilitate the degradation of NETs by binding to and disassociating histones from the DNA backbone (12). Other studies have reported the low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), enoxaparin, is able to prevent the formation of PMA induced NETs (13). Aside from these studies, and despite the importance of NETs in HIT, very little is known about the potential role of heparin in NET pathology, and the direct effect of heparin on neutrophils and NET formation has not been addressed.

Here we use a recently developed imaging flow cytometry approach (14) to show that heparin can directly stimulate NET formation, which is dependent on ROS and the activation of NE. We report two distinct phenotypes of NETs induced by heparin, one involves cell membrane disruption and cell death similar to that seen with PMA induced NETs, which we refer to as lytic NETs, while in the other phenotype, DNA is released from intact, viable neutrophils, referred to as vital NETs. We show that heparin, but not HS or the heparin derivative fondaparinux, induces NETs, while the LMWH enoxaparin induces NETs but to a much lower extent. These findings reveal a novel pathway of vital and lytic NET formation which should be considered in any setting which involves the interaction between neutrophils and heparin, and in particular during HIT.

## Methods

## Heparin and heparin-derivatives

Unfractionated heparin was from AY pharmaceuticals (Tokyo, Japan) and Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis, MO). Other heparin derivatives tested were heparan sulfate (Sigma-Aldrich), the LMWH enoxaparin (Sigma-Aldrich), and the heparin mimetic fondaparinux (Sigma-Aldrich). Details of these compounds are listed in Supplementary Table 1.

## Neutrophil isolation

Human donor blood was collected from volunteers in accordance with IRB of IFReC (Approval ID: 2814). Neutrophils were isolated from healthy human blood using Histopaquebased density gradient centrifugation as previously described (14). Briefly, cells were layered over Histopaque 1077 (Sigma-Aldrich) and Histopaque 1119 (Sigma-Aldrich), and centrifuged for 30 min at 1500 g. Neutrophils were collected from the Histopaque 1077 and Histopaque 1119 interface and washed in Hanks Buffered Salt Solution (HBSS) without calcium or magnesium (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Negative MACs separation with 2 µg/ml biotin anti-human CD235ab antibody (clone HIR2, BioLegend, San Diego, CA) and MojoSort™ Streptavidin Nanobeads (BioLegend) were used to remove residual erythrocytes.

## Stimulation of neutrophil extracellular trap formation

For imaging flow cytometry, neutrophils were treated as described previously (14). Briefly, cells were suspended in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium: Nutrient Mixture F-12 (DMEM/F12) with 15 mM HEPES and without phenol red (Thermo Fisher Scientific),

containing 1.6 µM Hoechst 33342 (Sigma-Aldrich), 25 nM SYTOX green (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and in some cases 1 µg/ml anti-CD16 BV605 (clone 3G8, BioLegend) (for image display only). Stimulants were added at the indicated concentrations and 0.1 volumes of 90% v/v Percoll was layered underneath the solution followed by incubation at 37 °C for indicated times. Cells were fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde (PFA) (Sigma-Aldrich) for at least 10 minutes at room temperature and analyzed without centrifugation or washing steps. In some cases neutrophils were incubated with 100 µM of the ROS scavenger pyrocatechol (Sigma-Aldrich), 10 µM of the NAPDH oxidase inhibitor DPI (Sigma-Aldrich), 20 µM of the NE inhibitor GW 311616A (Axon Medchem, Netherlands), or 200 µM of the PAD inhibitor Clamidine (Funakoshi, Japan) for 30 minutes at 37 °C before stimulation.

For fluorescence microscopy, neutrophils in DMEM/F12 with 15 mM HEPES and without phenol red (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were added to 8-well coverslip slides followed by the addition of stimulants for the indicated times at 37 °C. Cells were stained with 4 µM Hoechst 33342 (Sigma-Aldrich) and 200 nM SYTOX green (Thermo Fisher Scientific), fixed in 1% PFA, and imaged without washing steps by an Olympus Fluoview FV10i fluorescence microscope (Olympus) using a 60X objective.

## Imaging flow cytometry

Sample acquisition and analysis was performed as previously described (14). An ImageStream X Mark II imaging flow cytometer was used to collect data. The 60X objective was used at low flow and high sensitivity with 405 nM, 488nM, and 635nM lasers set to 120mW, 200mW, and 150mW power respectively. Acquisition was set to include clipped events. Events with brightfield area or SYTOX green area greater than 20um  were 2 collected. Compensation was performed using single stained controls.

Cell and DNA boundaries were determined using the 'Object(M01,Ch01,Tight)' and 'Morphology(M02,Ch02)' masks respectively. We defined the feature 'exDNA (intensity)' as 'Intensity\_Morphology(M02,Ch02) And Not Object(M01,Ch01,Tight)\_Ch02'. This feature, along with the features 'Intensity\_MC\_Ch07' (HO (Intensity)), 'Area\_Morphology(M07,Ch07)' (HO (Area)), and 'Intensity\_MC\_M02' (SYG (Intensity)) were used to classify cells as described in the gating strategy. Data was analyzed using the IDEAS v6.2 software package. Processed IDEAS files were exported as fcs files and statistics generated with Flowjo V10.

Statistics

Cell percentages were calculated from raw cell numbers in populations classified in the gating strategy, as previously described (14). First the total number of neutrophils was calculated as the sum of the 'Type III' and 'other' gates, and Type IIIa (Lytic NETs) (% Neutrophils) and Type IIIb (Vital NETs) (% Neutrophils) were calculated from this. The percentage of other cell types (from parent population) was adjusted to include Type III cells with the overall percentage of Type I, II, IIIa, IIIb, V, and VI cells adding to 100%. Type IV are DNA fragments not whole cells, and therefore were calculated separately as a percentage of all DNA+ events. A two sided Mann-Whitney test was used to calculate all p -values used and data is presented as the mean with individual data points shown.

## Results and Discussion

## Heparin directly induces both lytic and vital NET formation

NETs are reported to play a detrimental role in HIT by contributing towards thrombi formation (3). We therefore investigated if heparin could directly stimulate NET formation in vitro. Isolated human blood neutrophils were cultured with heparin or PMA and NET formation was monitored using an imaging flow cytometry method we recently developed (14). In this method a 3D culture of neutrophils is prepared to maintain NETs in solution, and NET formation is visualized using the cell membrane permeable and impermeable stains Hoechst (HO) and SYTOX green (SYG) respectively, and a fluorescent antibody for the neutrophil marker CD16. Cells are automatically characterized into six types based on morphological features such as the presence or absence of extracellular DNA (exDNA), and whether their cell membrane is intact, classified as follows: Healthy neutrophils (Type I), cells with decondensed nuclei (a precursor step to NET formation) (Type II), NETs (Type III), DNA fragments (Type IV), and dead cells with condensed or diffuse nuclei (Type V and VI respectively). See Supplementary Figure 1 for example images of these cell types and classification criteria.

Using this method we found that heparin stimulation alone can directly induce the formation of NETs, which were identified based on a HO intensity equal to healthy neutrophils (indicating an equal amount of DNA), and by the presence of exDNA (indicating release of DNA into the extracellular space) (Figure 1 A). Surprisingly, we found that heparin induced NETs displayed two markedly different phenotypes. The first consisted of large clouds of DNA, with almost a complete loss of cell structure. This phenotype resembles conventional NET formation such as seen with PMA stimulation (Figure 1 A), and is often referred to as NETosis, however, due to recent criticism of this term (9) we will refer to these as 'lytic

NETs'. Aside from lytic NETs, a subset of intact neutrophils was also observed releasing small amounts of extracellular DNA after heparin stimulation. These cells maintained their membrane integrity, based on exclusion of the SYG dye, and their nuclei displayed a normal lobulated structure. This distinct type of NET formation, which occurs without permeabilization of the cell membrane, was first reported soon after the discovery of conventional lytic NET formation, and is often referred to as vital NET formation (10). In the case of heparin stimulation, this appears to be the dominant form of NETs produced. We confirmed the formation of heparin induced NETs by fluorescence microscopy (Sup Figure 2). Diffuse, lytic NETs were frequently observed after heparin stimulation, although it was difficult to clearly identify vital NETs due to their dim extracellular DNA and the background fluorescence produced by lytic NET formation.

In order to account for these two distinct forms of NETs we modified our previously described algorithm for the characterization of NETs (Figure 1 B). After identifying NETs based on the presence of exDNA and their HO intensity, cells were further delineated based on SYG intensity and brightfield (BF) contrast. Lytic NETs display reduced BF contrast due to breakdown of the cell structure, along with increased SYG intensity due to complete staining of cellular DNA (these will be referred to as Type IIIa). Vital NETs have lower SYG intensity and high contrast as their cell structure and membrane remains intact (referred to as Type IIIb).

Using this method we found that three hours incubation with 10 IU/mL heparin induced 10.1% (± SD 0.9%) of neutrophils to form lytic NETs, compared with 3.8% (± SD 1.6%) in mock treated cells. The increase in vital NETs was more substantial, with 33.5% (± SD 8.6%) compared to 0.2% (± SD 0.2%) cells forming vital NETs in heparin and mock treated samples, respectively. This was in contrast to PMA stimulation which almost exclusively resulted in lytic NET formation (Figure 1 C, D). Aside from NET formation, after heparin stimulation we observed substantial amount of small particles which stained positive for SYG and HO, we refer to these as DNA fragments (Type IV events) (Figure 1 C). The source of these fragments is difficult to determine, however one possibility is they originate from the degradation of NETs.

During NET stimulation a subset of cells can undergo cell death without forming NETs (14,15). In our method, we classify these non-NET SYG positive cells as Type V and Type VI, based on a condensed and diffuse nuclear morphology, respectively. Lytic NET formation is generally thought to be preceded by an initial nuclear decondensation step, before cell membrane lysis and DNA release. We refer to cells with this morphology as Type II. These three cell types were not observed with heparin stimulation, and for brevity, will not be

referred to in this study. We have previously reported that LPS stimulation can also induce NET formation without a noticeable decondensation step and without inducing other types of cell death (14). While others have reported similar results for different stimuli such as monosodium urate crystals and immune complexes (15). In this respect, heparin induced lytic NET formation more closely mirrors these physiological pathways of NET formation, rather than that induced by PMA. Overall, our data demonstrates the ability of heparin to directly stimulate lytic NET formation, with morphology similar to PMA induced NETs, as well as substantial levels of vital NET formation, which occurs without cell membrane permeabilization.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating the ability of heparin to directly induce NET formation. Although heparin has been in clinical use for many decades as an anticoagulant, its precise in vivo activities remain incompletely understood. The best characterized interaction of heparin is with antithrombin and factor Xa, which facilitate its anticoagulant ability (16). But in addition to this, heparin is known to interact with a wide range of proteins, and have both pro and anti-inflammatory properties (17-19). Heparin has a wide range of binding partners which could potentially explain its ability to induce NET formation. For example, it is known to bind to L-selectin (18), and L-selectin binding has been reported to induce NET formation (20). Therefore, we investigated how heparin interacts with neutrophils.

## Heparin is rapidly taken up by neutrophils and induces NETs in a time and dose dependent manner

We used fluorescently conjugated heparin to investigate uptake by neutrophils. Neutrophils rapidly took up heparin in a spot pattern consistent with accumulation in endosomes (Figure 2 A). Heparin uptake was unaffected when cells were treated with the phagocytosis inhibitor cytochalasin D, or incubated in hyperosmolar conditions to inhibit endocytosis (Sup Figure 3). Heparin was able to induce significant NET formation after just five minutes stimulation, although the majority of vital NETs did not form for at least one hour (Figure 2 B, C). Notably, levels of DNA fragments observed after heparin stimulation seemed to correlate with lytic NET formation, increasing until one hour of incubation before decreasing slightly by three hours.

Heparin induced NET formation was dose dependent, with as little as 2 IU/mL heparin able to significantly induce vital NET formation, while 10 IU/mL or more was needed for lytic NET formation and increased levels of DNA fragments (Figure 2 D). These concentrations are clinically relevant, for example, heparin plasma concentrations can reach 8 IU/ml during

cardiac operations (21). Overall, we demonstrate rapid uptake of heparin and NET formation which was dose dependent.

Heparin binds to an extensive range of cell surface receptors, and further studies will be required to identify the pathway of uptake by neutrophils. One potentially relevant receptor is Hyaluronan Receptor for Endocytosis (HARE), which is known to facilitate heparin uptake, leading to activation of NF-kB (22,23). Interestingly, NF-kB activation is thought to be required for NET formation (24). For DNA fragments, we and others have previously identified these in the context of NET formation, however their exact nature and source has not been determined (25). A previous study has reported that heparin has the ability to degrade NETs (12). It is feasible that heparin may both induce NET formation, while also working to break NETs into these small DNA fragments and therefore these results support the idea that heparin may lead to both the formation of NETs, and their subsequent breakdown into small DNA fragments. The fate of these disassembled NETs is unclear, however, previous studies have shown that degradation of NETs by DNAse fails to mitigate the pathological actions of NET components such as histones (10). This suggests that if heparin does have the ability to dismantle NETs into smaller fragments, this may not necessarily be beneficial in vivo .

## Heparin induced NET formation depends on ROS and NE but is independent of NADPH oxidase and PAD activity

The generation of ROS through the activation of NAPDH oxidase is required for PMAinduced NET formation (5). Therefore, we next sought to address the requirement of ROS in heparin induced NET formation. Pre-incubation of neutrophils with the ROS scavenger pyrocatechol significantly reduced lytic and vital NET formation as well as levels of DNA fragments (Figure 3 A, B). Surprisingly, inhibition of NADPH oxidase by DPI had no effect on Heparin NET formation, although it was able to significantly reduce levels of DNA fragments (Sup Figure 4). At this stage it is unclear how heparin causes ROS in neutrophils, however, it should be noted that NET formation has previously been reported to occur without the involvement of NADPH oxidase (26,27).

Most pathways of NET formation are thought to depend on NE and PAD activity, which act to de-condense nuclear DNA in preparation for extracellular release. We therefore tested the role of these enzymes in heparin induced NET formation. Inhibition of NE, but not PADs, significantly reduced both vital and lytic heparin NET formation (Figure 3 C, D, Sup Figure 4), while both inhibitors reduced levels of DNA fragments. The role of NE in lytic NET formation is well established, however, its role in vital NET formation has not been thoroughly investigated. Our data shows a clear role for NE in vital NETs induced by

heparin. This serves to both cement these cells as genuine NET forming cells, and indicate a novel role for NE in the formation of vital NETs. The role of PADs in NET formation is controversial, and several studies have now reported these enzymes are dispensable for NET formation (8,28-30), despite earlier reports that they are essential (9,31,32). Our current and previous data indicates PADs are not required for NET formation by PMA (14), LPS (14), or heparin, in our experimental conditions. Notably, this result is in contrast to NET formation induced by Heparin/PF4/antibody complexes which was shown to rely on engagement of FcγRIIa and PAD4 activation (3). This suggests that heparin may induce NETs by two distinct pathways, via immune complex formation leading to lytic NETs, and directly via heparin uptake resulting in mainly vital NET formation. The link between ROS and activation of NE during NET formation is well known. For heparin induced NETs, it remains unclear how heparin initially induces ROS, and even more importantly, how NE activation leads to the distinct form of vital NET formation we observed. This will be addressed in further studies.

## NETs are induced by different sources of heparin but not by LMWH, heparin mimetics, or heparan sulfate

To rule out the possibility that heparin induced NET formation was limited to one heparin manufacturer, we tested the ability of heparin from a different manufacturer (Sigma-Aldrich) to induce NETs. Heparin from both manufacturers was able to induce vital and lytic NET formation, although the Sigma-Aldrich sourced heparin resulted in slightly reduced levels of DNA fragments (Figure 4 A, B). The heparin we used in this study is licensed for clinical use, and these results indicate our findings are not simply a batch, or manufacturer anomaly.

The potentially life threatening side effects associated with heparin treatment has prompted the development of LMWHs and heparin mimetics which are now in common use in the clinic. These compounds provide similar anticoagulant properties but have a reduced incidence of severe side effects. To determine if these compounds induced NETs in a similar way to heparin we incubated neutrophils with the LMWH, Enoxaparin, and the heparin mimetic, Fondaparinux. Enoxaparin induced lytic and vital NET formation, as well as increased levels of DNA fragments, however, these were all significantly reduced compared to heparin (more than 97% reduction of vital NETs). In contrast, Fondaparinux did not induce NETs or DNA fragments at all, and had no discernible effect on neutrophils (Figure 4 A, B). Enoxaparin results in fewer incidents of HIT in clinical trials (33), while Fondaparinux induced HIT has only been reported in a few rare cases (34,35). HIT is a procoagulatory disorder mediated by the development of platelet activating antibodies against heparin/PF4 complexes. The reduced levels of these antibodies found in patients treated with LMWH or

Fondaparinux is therefore thought to be the primary reason for decreased incidence of HIT (33,36), however, our study suggests the direct influence of these compounds on neutrophils may also play a role. NETs have been implicated in the pathology of HIT by enhancing thrombosis and stabilizing thrombi (3,4), and the ability of these compounds to directly induce NETs correlates with HIT incidence. Therefore, our findings suggest that the ability of heparin to directly induce NET formation should also be addressed in the context of HIT pathology.

Heparan sulfate is considered as a type of heparin, although it has markedly different properties, most importantly reduced negative charge and the inability to act as an anticoagulant. Unlike heparin, which is thought to be only contained within mast cells, heparan sulfate is ubiquitously expressed throughout the body on cell surfaces and in the extracellular matrix. We found that unlike heparin, heparan sulfate could not induce NET formation by neutrophils, although it did result in a significant increase in DNA fragments (Figure 4 A, B). This result highlights the unique properties of heparin required to induce NET formation.

Overall, we report three major findings for this study. We show that heparin can directly stimulate NET formation in a time and dose dependent manner. Unlike PMA, we found that heparin induces both lytic and vital NETs, which can be clearly visualized using imaging flow cytometry and are dependent on ROS and NE activation. Finally, we show that the LMWH enoxaparin has a much lower ability to induce NETs than heparin, while the heparin mimetic fondaparinux, and the closely related molecule, heparan sulfate, do not induce NETs. These findings have potential implications for understanding and mitigating heparin related pathologies such as HIT.

## Figure 1. Detection of heparin induced vital and lytic NETs by imaging flow cytometry.

Random representative selection of merged neutrophil images obtained by imaging flow cytometry from mock, 10 IU/mL heparin, or 100 nM PMA stimulated cells for 3 hours (A). SYG image brightness was optimized to visualize vital NETs, making lytic NET images appear saturated, although this was not the case. Gating strategy to quantify six distinct cell types (Type I - VI) adapted from (14), with the additional delineation of lytic and vital NETs (B). Total NETs (Type III) are selected from HO+ events based on the exDNA (Intensity) feature value (calculated as described in materials and methods). Lytic NETs (Type IIIa), are distinguished from vital NETs (Type IIIb) based on increased SYG (Intensity), due to loss of membrane integrity, and reduced BF (Contrast), due to degradation of the cell structure. DNA fragments (Type IV) are also positive for exDNA (Intensity), but are distinguished from NETs based on lower HO (Intensity). Remaining cells which are focused, single cells are then categorized based on HO (Area) (indicating nuclear area) and SYG (Intensity). SYG low, HO area low cells are normal neutrophils (Type I). SYG low, HO area high cells are cells with decondensed nuclei, which is observed in cells undergoing PMA induced NET formation, but was not observed with heparin stimulation (Type II). SYG high cells are dead cells which have lost their membrane integrity, with low and high HO area referred to as Type V and Type VI cells respectively. These cells also occur with PMA induced NET formation, but not heparin stimulation. Representative images are shown of healthy neutrophils (Type I), DNA fragments (Type IV), lytic NETs (Type IIIa) and vital NETs (Type IIIb), while decondensed nuclei cells (Type II), and dead cells (Type V and VI) cells are not shown. Data is from a representative sample stimulated with 10 IU/mL heparin for 3 hours. Quantification of cell populations after 100  nM PMA or 10 IU/ml heparin stimulation for 3 hours (C). Representation of average percentages of all cell types of neutrophils under different conditions (D). Note Type IV is not included in the overall percentage of neutrophils as these DNA fragments do not represent whole cells. Data represents technical replicates from one of three independent experiments with similar results. BF - Brightfield, CD16 anti-CD16 BV605, SYG - SYTOX Green, HO - Hoechst 33342, exDNA - extracellular DNA. SYG* indicates image brightness was decreased by tenfold in order to visualize lytic NET morphology. p -values were calculated by Mann-Whitney two-tailed test, ** p &lt; 0.01.

BF - Brightfield, SYG - SYTOX Green, HO - Hoechst 33342. p -values were calculated by Mann-Whitney two-tailed test, * p &lt; 0.05 between mock and treated samples.

Figure 3. Heparin induced NET formation depends on ROS and NE. Random representative selection of merged neutrophil images (A, C), and quantification of cell populations (B, D), obtained by imaging flow cytometry from 10 IU/mL heparin stimulated neutrophils with or without pretreatment with the ROS scavenger pyrocatechol (100 µM) (A, B), or the neutrophil elastase inhibitor GW 311616A (20 µM) (C, D). Data represents technical replicates from one of three independent experiments with similar results. SYG SYTOX Green, HO - Hoechst 33342. p -values were calculated by Mann-Whitney two-tailed test, * p &lt; 0.05, ** p &lt; 0.01 between mock and treated samples. ## p &lt; 0.01 between control and inhibitor treated samples.

Figure 4. NET formation in response to different heparins and compounds related to heparin. Random representative selection of merged neutrophil images (A), and quantification of cell populations (B), obtained by imaging flow cytometry from neutrophils stimulated with 10 IU/mL Heparin (from AY Pharma or Sigma-Aldrich), 20 µg/mL of the low molecular weight heparin enoxaparin, 20 µg/mL of the heparin mimetic fondaparinux, or 20 µg/mL of the related compound heparan sulfate. Data represents technical replicates from one of three independent experiments with similar results. SYG - SYTOX Green, HO Hoechst 33342. p -values were calculated by Mann-Whitney two-tailed test, * p &lt; 0.05 between mock and treated samples. ## p &lt; 0.01 between heparin and enoxaparin treated samples.
