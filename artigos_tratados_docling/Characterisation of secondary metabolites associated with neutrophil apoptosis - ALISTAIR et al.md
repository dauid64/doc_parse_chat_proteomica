Abstract  We studied changes  in secondary metabolites  in human  neutrophils  undergoing constitutive  r tumour  necrosis o factor  (TNFa)  stimulated poptosis y a combination  of  higha b performance  liquid chromatography (HPLC) and  NMR spectroscopy.  Our results  show  that in contrast  to freshly isolated  eutrophils, eutrophil  cells ged for  20 h in  vitro ad n n a h marked  differences  n the levels f a number i o of endogenous metabolites ncluding  lactate,  mino  acids  and phosphocholine i a (PCho).  There was no change in  the  concentration f  taurine  or o glutamate  and the  ATP/ADP ratio  was not  affected.  evels  of L glutamine  and lactate  ctually  ecreased. dentical  hanges  were a d I c also  observed  in  neutrophils  timulated o  undergo  apoptosis  ver s t o a shorter  time period  (6  h) in the  presence  of  TNFct  and the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase  ibitor ortmannin  (WM).  The inh w changes  in  the  concentration  f  PCho  suggest ossible  ctivation o p a of  phosphoHpase  associated  ith  apoptosis r  a selective ilure w o fa of  phosphatidycholine  ynthesis. e increased evels  f  apoptosis s Th l o obtained  with  WM+TNFcz, compared to  TNFtz by  itself,  ggest su a synergistic fect  y these  compounds. The acceleration  n  rate ef b i of apoptosis  probably arises  from  suppression  by  WM of pathway(s)  that  normally  delay  the  onset  of  apoptusis.  hanges C in PCho and  other endogenous metabolites, f  proven to be i characteristic   apoptosis  n  other  cell  ystems, ay permit  nonof i s m invasive  uantification  f  apoptosis. q o
