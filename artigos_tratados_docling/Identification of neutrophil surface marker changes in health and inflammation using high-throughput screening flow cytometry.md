## a b s t r a c t

Neutrophils are the most abundant white blood cell and are an essential component of the innate immune system. A complete cataloguing of cell surface markers has not been undertaken for neutrophils isolated from circulation as well as healthy and in /uniFB02 amed tissues. To identify cell-surface markers speci /uniFB01 c to human neutrophils, we used high-throughput /uniFB02 ow cytometry to screen neutrophil populations isolated from blood and oral rinses from healthy and chronic periodontitis patients against a panel of 374 known cluster of differentiation (CD) antibodies. This screen identi /uniFB01 ed CD11b, CD16, and CD66b as markers that are consistently expressed on neutrophils independent of the cell location, level of activation and disease state. Cell sorting against CD11b, CD16 and CD66b allowed for the enrichment of mature neutrophils, yielding neutrophil populations with up to 99% purity. These /uniFB01 ndings suggest an ideal surface marker set for isolating mature neutrophils from humans. The screen also demonstrated that tissue neutrophils from chronically in /uniFB02 amed tissue display a unique surface marker set compared to tissue neutrophils present in healthy, non-in /uniFB02 amed tissues.

## 1. Introduction

A neutrophil cellular in /uniFB01 ltrate is commonly found in the oral cavity of healthy and diseased subjects. Nevertheless, patients diagnosed with chronic periodontitis, a neutrophil-mediated in/uniFB02 ammatory condition that affects the supporting tissues of the teeth resulting in irreversible tissue destruction, have higher levels of neutrophils in the oral cavity than healthy patients [1,2]. The abundance of oral neutrophils in both health and disease provides a non-invasive means of harvesting transmigrated neutrophils through oral rinses. Isolated oral neutrophils (PMN-O) can then be examined to determine phenotypical changes of tissue neutrophils in healthy and in /uniFB02 amed tissues compared to the basal phenotype of circulatory blood neutrophils (PMN-B) [1,3].

Well-described and consistent methods of neutrophil isolation, identi /uniFB01 cation, and detailed characterization are critical for further understanding of neutrophil biology and the innate immune system. Unfortunately, non-standardized approaches in neutrophil isolation protocols leads to inconsistencies between studies in

terms of cell yields, purity and viability [4 -6]. Flow cytometry is commonly used to evaluate neutrophil surface markers [7]. However, the identi /uniFB01 cation and characterization of neutrophils using this technology is far from uniform in the /uniFB01 eld since a de/uniFB01 nitive marker set for neutrophils has yet to be identi /uniFB01 ed [8]. Currently CD11b, CD14, CD15, CD16 and CD62L are used individually or in some combination to identify pure human neutrophil populations [8 -11]. Likewise, CD11b and Ly6G have been used to identify mouse neutrophils [12]. Presently, there are references and web resources that characterize all known CD markers in all cell types based on a cataloguing of existing studies. Despite over 370 known CD markers, most studies evaluate one or two markers at a time with non-uniform patient populations and cell isolation protocols. Therefore, conclusions drawn from reported studies are not always comparable [13], resulting in con/uniFB02 icting data about the presence of many markers and reports of CD of markers that fail to differentiate between neutrophils and other leukocytes [13]. Neutrophils are key in the pathogenesis and resolution of a variety of clinical disorders. Therefore, it is imperative that we /uniFB01 rst elucidate the baseline expression pro /uniFB01 le of surface antigens on neutrophils in health. The use of highthroughput screening (HTS) /uniFB02 ow cytometry gives us the opportunity to rapidly evaluate all known CD markers simultaneously in an unbiased manner. On it's own, HTS is a discovery-oriented screening tool that allows for identi /uniFB01 cation of surface proteins in

cells of interest by using a large panel of CD markers in a highly reproducible fashion. In addition, HTS can be combined with /uniFB02 uorescent cell barcoding, sorting and functional assays that ultimately allow for the identi /uniFB01 cation and characterization of a unique set of biomarkers in health and disease. In this study, our ultimate aim was to identify a unique and universal cell-surface signature in neutrophils independent of its location and state of activation. A consistent and well-de /uniFB01 ned neutrophil signature would permit rapid and reproducible isolation of circulatory mature neutrophils. In parallel we aim to demonstrate that the signature we identify does not change signi /uniFB01 cantly as neutrophils transmigrate from circulation into healthy and in /uniFB02 amed tissues.

## 2. Materials and methods

## 2.1. Study population

Patients were screened at the University of Toronto, Faculty of Dentistry for periodontal disease. Periodontal examination was conducted to con /uniFB01 rm the diagnosis of periodontal disease, which is based on the current diagnostic framework [14]. Ten patients without periodontal disease (Healthy), and ten patients with generalized severe chronic periodontitis (CP), were enrolled in this study. All enrolled participants were systemically healthy and selfreported non-smokers. After a complete intraoral examination, blood and oral rinse collection was conducted. Participants provided written informed consent in order to participate, and the Scienti /uniFB01 c and Ethics Review Boards at the University of Toronto, Faculty of Dentistry, approved the study (Protocol # 29,410).

## 2.2. Blood collection and processing

Blood samples were drawn from the antecubital vein into a vacutainer containing 0.1 vol of sodium citrate anticoagulant (Becton Dickinson, Canada). Samples were divided in two. For the /uniFB01 rst set, neutrophils were separated using 1-layer gradient of 1-step polymorphs as previously described [15]. Brie /uniFB02 y, gradients were centrifuged at 527 relative centrifugal force for 30 min at room temperature, the lower of two bands was collected. Cells were washed with Hanks balanced salt solution without calcium or magnesium (HBSS-/-), and erythrocyte lysis was performed by incubating with 1 mL of BD Pharm Lyse buffer. For the second set, only erythrocyte depletion was performed by incubating the samples at 4 ° C for 5 min with 1 mL of BD Pharm Lyse buffer (Becton Dickinson, Canada). Cell count was obtained using an automated counter (Coulter Counter, Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA), and viability of cells was assessed by trypan blue exclusion test.

## 2.3. Oral sample collection and processing

The oral cavity of each participant was rinsed for 30 s with 0.9% NaCl and collected into a 50 mL Falcon tube, as previously described[1]. This sequence was repeated 5 -20 times (5 -10 /C2 for CP patients and 15 -20 /C2 for healthy patients) with three minutes intervals between rinses. The collected material was halved. Half was passed sequentially through a 40 m m, 20 m m and 11 m m nylon mesh to eliminate epithelial cell contamination and was used for High-throughput screening assay. For the second half only 40 m m /uniFB01 ltration was performed and the sample used for standard FACS. Similar to the blood samples, cells were counted utilizing an automated counter (Coulter Counter, Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA), and viability of cells was assessed by trypan blue exclusion test. To minimize phenotypic and functional changes as a result of cellular activation, all steps of the density gradient separation procedure, sorting and cell staining procedures were performed immediately

after cell collection at 4 ° C using non- pyrogenic reagents and plasticware. Oral PMN isolation would start at chairside at 4 ° C, simultaneously to the oral rinse collection.

## 2.4. High-throughput screening assay

Twenty million viable cells were resuspended in HBSS -/-supplemented with 2 mM EDTA and 1% BSA (Flow buffer), immediately after collection. Cells were blocked with rat and mouse IgG (1 mg mL /C0 1 ) at 1:100 dilution for 10 min and 500 microliters of cells were removed to serve as controls. All cells were resuspended in staining media containing eFluor506 or eFluor780 to identify non-vital cells. Fifty microliters of the above mixture was added directly to each well, preloaded with 2 -5 μ l of each individual antibody based on previous plate set up and validation [16] (for a full list of antibodies used, please see supplement Table S1) and incubated for 30 min in the dark. Plates were then centrifuged, and medium was removed by aspiration. Cells were sequentially resuspended and washed after each step. Finally, cells were /uniFB01 xed with Fixation/Permeabilization solution (Becton Dickinson, Canada) and kept in the dark at 4 ° C until analysis. In parallel, control samples were prepared; aliquots were stained in 1.5 mL tubes for /uniFB02 uorescence-minus-one controls for each of the /uniFB02 uorophores used (PE, APC and FITC) and control for viability staining. The high-throughput /uniFB02 ow cytometry analysis was performed using a BD-high-throughput sampler LSRII /uniFB02 ow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, Canada), with default /uniFB01 lter con /uniFB01 guration and compensation was set by using BD CompBeads (Becton Dickinson, Canada) at UHN Antibody Core Facility, Toronto, ON, as previously described [16].

## 2.5. Data acquisition and analysis

Each well of the 96-well plate was sampled with a total read time of 30 min. For each well, 1000 -10,000 cells were analyzed; for increased reliability, samples with less than 1000 events were excluded from our analysis. An initial template /uniFB01 le was generated using electronic gates within the software to create a hierarchical population tree at the beginning of the screen, and using the template, all additional analyses were completed after data acquisition was complete. The template /uniFB01 le included compensation adjustment, which was uniformly applied to all the data collected in order to minimize /uniFB02 uorescence overlap between detection channels. The following gating strategy was used: a forward and side scatter pro /uniFB01 les (plot of FSC-A vs. SSC-A) were used to visually identify the neutrophil population and eliminate debris. Gates were manually drawn to remove cell doublets (plots of FSC-W vs. FSC-H and then SSC-W vs. SSC-H) and subsequently to select viable cells based on exclusion of eFluor506 (or eFluor 780) positive cells. Next, two-dimensional plots were used (APC vs. PE and/or FITC vs. PE). Finally, one-dimensional histograms for each /uniFB02 uorescence parameter were constructed for the identi /uniFB01 ed cells. ' Positive ' and ' negative ' gating of the /uniFB02 uorescence signal was drawn based on /uniFB02 uorescence intensity of the positive and isotope controls, and these gates were applied to all individual wells on a per plate basis (Supplemental Fig. S2 and S3). This template was applied to all subsequent plates. If required, a manual adjustment of each gate was completed before data analysis. All data (FCS 3.0 /uniFB01 les) were exported and then analyzed with FlowJo software (Treestar).

## 2.6. Cell sorting

Cells were sorted at a concentration of 10 6 cells/mL in PBS/25% BSA using a FACSAria cell sorter (BD Bioscience) at the Flow Cytometry facility at Department of Immunology, University of

Toronto, Toronto, ON. To prevent cell death due to pressure and sheer stress, all sorts were performed with a 100 m m nozzle. Side scatter and forward scatter pro /uniFB01 les were used to eliminate debris and cell doublets, while non-viable cells were eliminated by excluding eFluor506 (or eFluor 780) positive cells.

## 2.7. Cytospin preparation and staining

In order to con /uniFB01 rm the purity of neutrophils, sorted cells were cytocentrifuged and mounted on slides using a Cytospin centrifuge (Shandon, Ramsey, MN) for 5 min at 800 RPM, as previously described [15]. Brie /uniFB02 y, cytospins of sorted populations were /uniFB01 xed in methanol for 30 s at room temperature. The cytospins were then air dried and stained with Diff-Quik (Fisher Scienti /uniFB01 c) staining kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cells were examined by light microscopy at 200 and 400 /C2 /uniFB01 nal magni /uniFB01 cation.

## 2.8. Statistical analysis

Statistical analysis was performed using one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni's multiple comparisons test, unless speci /uniFB01 ed otherwise. P r 0.05 was considered statistically signi /uniFB01 cant (GraphPad

software). Heatmaps, hierarchical clustering analyses were performed using MultiExperiment Viewer (MeV) software (www.tm4. org). Unsupervised hierarchical clustering was performed using a Pearson correlation distance metric with complete linkage clustering.

## 3. Results

3.1. Cell surface marker screen of neutrophils from blood and oral rinses in health and during chronic oral in /uniFB02 ammation

Neutrophils were isolated from blood and oral rinses of healthy and chronic periodontitis (CP) patients and screened against a panel of 374 known CD antibodies. The gating strategy used (see methods) yielded a highly pure neutrophil population ( Z 99% of mature neutrophils) as con /uniFB01 rmed by visual inspection with light microscopy following cell sorting (Supplemental /uniFB01 le S1). Based on the screens, it was evident that neutrophils express 145 different CD markers in at least one of the four compartments (BloodHealth, Blood-Disease, Oral-Health, Oral-Disease). An extensive literature search was carried out to identify previously described

The newly identi /uniFB01 ed cell-surface markers not previously described were CDw198,

CDw199, CD322 and CD328. Further, the expression of /uniFB01 ve CD markers (CDw12, CD156a, CD156c, CD285, CD361) previously reported in the literature could not be con /uniFB01 rmed, as these markers were not part of our panel. Lastly, the expression of CD218a could also not be con /uniFB01 rmed, with an average expression of 0.2% ( 7 0.1)

of positive neutrophils across our samples.

3.2. Neutrophils present with a unique signature based on their location

The current neutrophil literature acknowledges that neutrophils are highly adaptable cells [17]. Under certain pathological conditions, neutrophils are able to differentiate into different subsets, each one with a unique phenotype and functional pro /uniFB01 le [18,19]. Using HTS /uniFB02 ow cytometric analysis for immunophenotyping, we narrowed our focus from 145 markers to 90

CD markers on neutrophils isolated from blood and oral rinses of 10 healthy controls and 10 CP patients. The 90 CD markers were chosen based on previous knowledge of reported expression in the literature. Also, constitutively expressed markers with constant expression independent of location or underlying disease were included in the panel of chosen CD markers. In addition, markers with signi /uniFB01 cantly varied expression following transmigration out of circulation and into the oral cavity were also selected for further analysis. Lastly, markers reportedly not expressed in neutrophils were included as negative controls.

With the selected 90 CD markers, an unsupervised hierarchical

clustering using percent-positive values was preformed to determine if cell surface pro /uniFB01 ling could be used to de /uniFB01 ne a subtype signature for neutrophils (Fig. 2 and Fig. S3). Cell surface phenotyping strati /uniFB01 ed samples into clusters related to the origin such that PMN-B and PMN-O each formed a cluster, irrespective of disease status (Fig. 2). Further exploration identi /uniFB01 ed a site-speci /uniFB01 c neutrophil CD marker pro /uniFB01 le that was further altered in the presence of local in /uniFB02 ammation. The in /uniFB02 ammatory PMN-O pro /uniFB01 le was characterized by increased expression of markers associated with an inhibitory role of the neutrophil function with up-regulation of CD85a, CD305 and CD312. Similar to a report by Baudhuin et al. [20], expression of CD85a was almost absent in PMN-B. Conversely, CD85a was highly expressed in the PMN-O, which may be indicative of the activation state of these cells. The PMN-B cluster also displayed an up-regulation of CD31, CD43, CD44, CD46, CD50, CD62L, and CD162, which collectively play a role in regulating neutrophil-endothelial interactions. In addition, CD147 and CD181 were also found to be up-regulated in PMN-B, both of which are reported to enhance neutrophil chemotaxis and function [3]. Although not statistically signi /uniFB01 cant, CD114, CD132 and CD182 also displayed increased expression in PMN-B in a fraction of healthy patients. It was previously reported that CD116, CD132, CD182 and CD217 are cytokine receptors that allow neutrophils to respond to extracellular in /uniFB02 ammatory cues [21]. CD132 along with CD122 are functional subunits of IL-15 receptor (IL15R) [22]. IL-15 is a proin /uniFB02 ammatory cytokine that plays a role in enhancing neutrophil phagocytosis.

3.3. Oral neutrophils in CP patients are characterized by an active phenotype

The CD marker pro /uniFB01 le of PMN-O of CP patients is characterized by an increased expression of CD11b, CD63, CD66, CD66b, CD66c and CD66e (p-value 4 0.05, CTR PMN-O vs. CP PMN-O) (Fig. 3). CD11b, also known as Mac-1 α , is an integrin α Mchain and is part of the integrin family that pairs with CD18 (integrin M β 2 chain) to form the C3 complement receptor.

3.4. Cell sorting with an antibody against CD11b, CD16 and CD66b allowed for the enrichment of highly pure mature neutrophils in the blood

Density gradients used to isolate neutrophils result in neutrophil cell purity of Z 95%, with contaminating cells being identi /uniFB01 ed as 1 -5% for eosinophils, basophils, mast cells and 1 -2% for other mononuclear cells [23]. Even a 5% cellular contamination can alter phenotypical and functional assays, which is why researchers are constantly striving for methods that yield increased purity. Cell surface markers have been used for the identi /uniFB01 cation and isolation of neutrophils by FACS and immunoselection [8,24,25]. Denny et al. described a method of using antibodies and negative selection to eliminate other leukocyte contaminants from a density gradient puri /uniFB01 ed neutrophil fraction [10]. However, until now, there is no speci /uniFB01 c cell-surface marker signature that can be used to isolate neutrophils, since most markers are co-expressed by other cell types that commonly contaminate neutrophil

preparations (Table 1 summarizes known expression and functions of these markers). Among the CD markers that were expressed in all analyzed samples, independent of the compartment or activation state, we found CD11a, CD11b, CD13, CD16, CD18, CD55, CD66b, CD170 and CD172 to be each consistently expressed by more than 90% of neutrophils (Fig. 4A). By selecting 3 markers CD11b, CD16 and CD66b, we were able to determine a unique neutrophil signature (Fig. 4B). CD11b is an integrin family member, which pairs with CD18 to form the CR3 heterodimer and is the most commonly used marker in neutrophil biology. Studies have shown CD11b to be directly involved in cellular adhesion, however migration will only take place if CD18 subunit is present. CD11b is

known to be expressed in many leukocytes subsets including monocytes, neutrophils, natural killer cells, and macrophages [26]. CD16 is glycosyl phosphatidyl inositol-anchored (GPI) protein that acts as a receptor for the Fc region of immunoglobulin gamma (Fc gamma RIII). It was also reported that CD16 is involved in neutrophil transendothelial migration by interacting with integrins during in /uniFB02 ammation. It is speci /uniFB01 cally expressed by human neutrophils and activated eosinophils [25]. CD66b is a granulocytic speci /uniFB01 c receptor, member of carcinoembryonic antigen family. Its main function is to mediate phagocytosis [27]. By combining the three aforementioned markers it is possible to select a pure mature neutrophil population, which excludes the main

contaminating cells, while selecting all the cells of interest. We sorted whole blood cells, after erythrocyte lysis, and oral rinse samples, based on expression of CD11b, CD16 and CD66b. Purity and morphology of sorted samples was further analyzed by light microscopic examinations of cytospins preparations (Fig. 4C). Following puri /uniFB01 cation using these three markers, eosinophils were the prevalent contaminating cells in the blood samples (0.4 7 0.3% of cells), while epithelial cells constitute the majority of contaminants in the oral samples (0.8 7 0.2%). Monocytes and lymphocytes comprised a negligible amount of contaminants in both populations. This clearly demonstrates that a combination of these markers is a simple method to isolate mature neutrophils in healthy and patients with neutrophil mediated diseases.

## 4. Discussion

Periodontitis is a common chronic in /uniFB02 ammatory disease that is triggered by pathogenic micro /uniFB02 ora in the bio /uniFB01 lm or dental plaque that forms around to the teeth [28]. There has been a recent paradigm shift in our understanding of the etiology of periodontitis from a bio /uniFB01 lm driven condition to a condition mediated by a misdirected immunological response to a bacterial insult. Although the presence of bacteria is essential for the initiation and progression of periodontal disease, the simple presence of bacteria does not lead to tissue breakdown; rather neutrophils play a central role in maintaining periodontal health [29]. Chronic periodontitis is associated with a hyperactive neutrophil response that includes hyperactive oxidative stress and secretion of in/uniFB02 ammatory mediators as well as phagocytic abnormalities [28]. The ability of neutrophils to regulate phagocytosis, by altering the expression of CD44 and CD116 can play a major role in balancing health and disease at the bio /uniFB01 lm-tissue interface where a multitude of bacterial species and constant in /uniFB02 ux of PMN-O constantly interact. Our data clearly demonstrate down-regulation of both markers in PMN-O of CP patients when compared with healthy controls.

## 4.1. The neutrophil cell surface signature

Detailed characterizations of neutrophils prove to be critical for further understanding of both neutrophil biology. Inconsistencies between cell yields, viability, or cell surface marker expression, or even incorrectly identi /uniFB01 ed cell populations are likely to account for some of the variations among previous studies of neutrophil functions [4,5]. Flow cytometry is routinely used to determine if a selected cell population is expressing a particular protein or receptor of interest. In addition, /uniFB02 ow cytometry has been used to quantify the amount of protein expressed on the basis of intensity of /uniFB02 uorescence [30]. Immunophenotyping leukocyte populations using multicolor /uniFB02 ow cytometry has been established and offers the advantage of parallel comparison of surface expression of a molecule between two or more cell populations [31]. However, without a clear de /uniFB01 nition of cell-surface expression pro /uniFB01 le of each cell population, interpretation of data might be compromised.

Cell surface molecules, collective named as the cell ' surfaceome , are known to perform vital cell functions, acting as re-' ceptors, transporters, channels, and enzymes [32]. High-throughput screening (HTS) assays, commonly used to test chemical compounds in the pharmaceutical industry, are now widely used to phenotype and categorize cells [32]. Flow cytometry (FC) utilize /uniFB02 uorescently-tagged antibodies to detect cell surface proteins. The combination of HTS with FC allow the evaluation of over 350 known CD markers at a time, using a high-speed sample loading device for /uniFB02 ow cytometers [16]. This high throughput /uniFB02 ow cytometry (HTS-FC) assay is highly reproducible and can be used to

answer a wide range of research questions, such as characterization of cell populations, identi /uniFB01 cation of cell subsets, isolation for functional assays and molecular pro /uniFB01 ling, development of therapeutic targets, or biomarkers that can be prognostic or associated with speci /uniFB01 c responses, and moreover, they can be used for disease detection and classi /uniFB01 cation [33,34]. We used HTS-FC analysis of tissue and blood neutrophils to investigate simultaneously over 370 cell-surface markers in patients with different in /uniFB02 ammatory conditions. This method allow us to con /uniFB01 rm the expression of well know neutrophils markers such as CD11b, CD16, CD62L, and also allow us to identify markers that were not previously described in the neutrophil cell surface: CDw198, CDw199, CD322 and CD328.

CDw198 and CDw199 are predicted to be transmembrane proteins similar to G protein-coupled receptors. CDw198 is also known as C-C chemokine receptor 8 (CCR8), with a suggested role in regulation of monocyte chemotaxis and thymic cells apoptosis. CDw199 is C-C chemokine receptor 9 (CCR9), and is known to be expressed in the lymphoid tissue located in the large intestine and is up-regulated during dextran sulfate sodium induced colitis [35]. CD322 a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily, is expressed in epithelial cells as well as monocytes and plays a role in leukocyte transmigration during in /uniFB02 ammation [36]. CD328 or Siglec-7 is primarily found in natural killer NK cells where it works as an inhibitory receptor [37]. Future research will be required to investigate the possible role of these molecules in neutrophils.

4.2. Oral neutrophils in CP patients are characterized by an active phenotype

Oral PMNs in CP patients are characterized by an increased expression of CD11b, CD63, CD66, CD66b, CD66c and CD66e. CD11b, also known as Mac-1 α , is an integrin α Mchain and is part of the integrin family that pairs with CD18 (integrin M β 2 chain) to form the C3 complement receptor. CD11b/CD18 is involved in chemotaxis, adhesion and transmigration of neutrophils. Additionally, it plays a crucial role in neutrophil phagocytosis [38]. CD63 is a glycoprotein, member of the tetraspanin family that upon activation is strongly expressed on the surface of neutrophils and is therefore considered as a marker for granule release [27]. Similar to other members of the tetraspanins family, CD63 operates through interaction with integrins, most likely CD11b/CD18. In addition to serving as a marker of cell activation and mediating granule release, CD63 has also been reported to play a role in mediating membrane fusion events [39]. Neutrophils are known to express several glycosylated carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)-related glycoproteins (CD66 antigens) [40]. These markers play a role in adhesion to E-selectin and their up-regulation is associated with activation of neutrophils, activation of β 2-integrins, priming of the respiratory burst and mediating cell shape change [41]. Taken together we speculate that as part of the chronic oral in /uniFB02 ammation process, PMN-O alter their basal CD marker expression pro /uniFB01 le to one that is characterized by an active phenotype. These results likely re /uniFB02 ect the neutrophil activations state in a chronic in /uniFB02 amed environment. Of particular interest is the lack of these markers on oral neutrophils present in the tissues of healthy mouths. These cells are certainly recruited by the bacterial bio /uniFB01 lm present in the mouths of healthy patients but are not activated to the same extent as the oral neutrophils in patients with periodontal disease. This could be due to the differences in the bio /uniFB01 lms in health and disease [42] or possibly to variations in patient neutrophil responses and sensitivity to the bio /uniFB01 lms present.

In summary, the use of HTS-FC gave us the opportunity to rapidly evaluate all known CD markers simultaneously [43]. The primary aim of this study was to identify a unique neutrophil cellsurface signature, independent of location and activation state that would permit isolation of mature neutrophils. In parallel we aimed

to identify changes in the neutrophil phenotype subsequent to neutrophil transmigration from circulation into the site of in/uniFB02 ammation, characterizing tissue neutrophils in patients diagnosed with a chronic in /uniFB02 ammatory disease. We identi /uniFB01 ed CD11b, CD16, and CD66b as markers that are constitutively expressed on neutrophils independent of the cell location, level of activation and disease state. Furthermore, based on the CD markers expression and using unsupervised cluster analysis we were able to: 1) discriminate the location of the neutrophils; 2) distinguish between neutrophil phenotypes during chronic in /uniFB02 ammatory disease and health. Finally, we could demonstrate that oral neutrophils of chronic periodontitis patients are characterized by an active neutrophil phenotype with up-regulation of members of the integrins family such as CD11b, and up-regulation of activation markers such as CD63 and CD66. Future screens may reveal markers that possibly de /uniFB01 ne subpopulations of neutrophils and opens new avenues for researchers in the /uniFB01 eld.
