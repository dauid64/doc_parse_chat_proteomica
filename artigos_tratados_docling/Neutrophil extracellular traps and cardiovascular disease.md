## A B S T R A C T

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a significant global health concern, ranking among the top five causes of disability-adjusted life-years (DALY) in 190 countries and territories. Neutrophils, key players in the innate immune system, combat infections by releasing neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) composed of DNA, histones, elastase, myeloperoxidase, and antimicrobial peptides. This paper explores the relationship between NETs and cardiovascular diseases, focusing on conditions such as heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and ischemia-reperfusion injury. Particularly, it delves into the impact of NETs on atrial fibrillation and pulmonary hypertension, as well as the role of myeloperoxidase (MPO) and neutrophil elastase (NE) in these diseases. Furthermore, the potential of targeting NETs for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases is discussed.

## 1. Introduction

CVD is a systemic disease that significantly impacts global morbidity and mortality rates. It ranks among the top five contributors to global DALY in 190 countries and territories. Ischaemic heart disease and stroke, both clinical outcomes of atherosclerosis, stand out as the primary causes of mortality within the realm of CVDs [1]. Recent research has shown that NETs play a significant role in the development of various CVDs [2], such as coronary atherosclerosis [3], atrial fibrillation [4], and thrombosis [5].

## 2. Formation of NET

In 2004, Brinkmann discovered that neutrophils release chromatin structures containing granular proteins, now known as NETs. NETosis is described as a programmed cell death mechanism where neutrophils eliminate extracellular bacteria[6]. Neutrophils have recognition receptors on their cell membrane,including lipopolysaccharides (LPS)[7] that detect pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) like the cell wall of Gram-negative bacteria. Toll-4-like receptors (TLR4) are involved in this recognition process. Additionally, there are damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) such as extracellular ATP [8] 、 pattern-recognition receptors [9] for Monosodium urate

(MSU)[10] 、 complement factor C5a receptor [11] 、 FC receptor,cytokine receptor,and activated platelet P-selectin receptor [12].Upon receiving a stimulatory signal,these receptors become activated and increase intracellular Ca 2 + concentration. This activation enriches and activates neutrophils towards the signaling source through pathways involving protein kinase C (PKC) and RAF/MEK/ERK [13].Simultaneously, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase is activated along with mitochondrial damage. These events promote the conversion of oxygen into reactive oxygen species (ROS) like H2O2, OCl-, OH-, and other potent oxidant derivatives [14] H2O2 · acts as a substrate for myeloperoxidase (MPO), which triggers the release of primary granule proteins from neutrophils, including NE and MPO[15].NE then activates peptidylarginine deiminase 4 (PAD4) in the nucleus.PAD4 catalyzes the citrullination of arginine residues on histones, resulting in the formation of citrullinated histones (CitH3), weakening the electrostatic interaction between histones and DNA. This process initiates chromatin depolymerization and nuclear swelling [16]. Moreover, there is an increased release of MPO and NE from azurophilic particles, causing the nuclear volume to enlarge until both the nuclear and plasma membranes are unable to counteract it. Additionally, NE induces pore formation through the perforator protein GSDMD, reducing cell membrane stability and increasing Ca 2 + concentration. GSDMD,a member of the Gasdermin family,is cleaved by

inflammasomes to generate a GSDMD-N fragment, which binds to negatively charged phospholipids on cell membranes to form membrane pores that disrupt the cell membrane [17]. Increasing evidence highlights specific functions of GSDMD in neutrophils, such as mediating the formation of NETs in transfusion-associated acute lung injury and SARS-CoV-2 infection [18].Ultimately, the cell membrane ruptures, allowing depolymerized chromatin to mix with cytoplasmic components and granule proteins, forming extracellular DNA-protein complex structures known as NETs [19].

The formation and release of NETs is thought to occur by two different mechanisms: NETosis with neutrophil death and formation of NET without neutrophil death.NETosis is initiated by stimulatory signals like PMA [20] and cholesterol crystals [21], leading neutrophils to activate the NADPH oxidase (NOX) complex, resulting in the release of reactive oxygen species (ROS), cell membrane rupture, and subsequent NETs release. Another mechanism is triggered by a signal that causes Ca 2 + influx, activating the SK3 channel and promoting mitochondrial ROS production [22],allowing neutrophils to extrude DNA in vesicles without undergoing cell death. This process does not involve NOX and enables neutrophils to remain viable. For example, Candida albicans hyphae induce NETs formation in fungi through complement receptor 3 and β -glucan recognition, relying on Fn and ERK signaling pathways rather than ROS [23].

## 3. Structure of NETs

NETs are reticular structures consisting of DNA as the backbone, along with histones (primarily citrullinated histone 3, CitH3) 、 NE 、 MPO 、 and antimicrobial peptide (LL-37). DNA acts as the scaffold for NETs [24].The DNA itself possesses high microbicidal properties due to the phosphodiester bond in its backbone, which effectively chelates

divalent cations. Citrullination of histones, which loosens their grip on DNA, enables DNA to interact with bacteria and exhibit the antibacterial effects of NETs [25]. In eukaryotic cells, 147 bp of DNA wraps tightly around a core histone octamer (comprising two of each histone H3, H2B, H2A, and H4) to form a nucleosome core particle [26].Posttranslational modifications of histone proteins, such as acetylation, phosphorylation, and methylation, regulate various chromatin functions,including transcription, DNA damage repair, and chromatin condensation/decondensation [27].The PAD4-catalyzed hypercitrul lination of histones appears to be crucial in regulating the unfolding of chromatin structures during NETs formation [28].NE, a neutrophil-specific serine protease, degrades virulence factors and bacteria [29].NE initially translocates to the nucleus, where it digests nucleosomal histones and facilitates extensive chromatin decondensation. The synergy between NE and MPO promotes nuclear decondensation, potentially serving as a key trigger for prompt cell rupture and NETs release [16].Studies have shown that NE and MPO knockout mice exhibit increased susceptibility to bacterial and fungal infections [30], possibly attributed to a deficiency in NETs formation [16].NETs combat bacterial infections by releasing antimicrobial proteins, such as calprotectin, which disrupt the cell membrane of pathogens, leading to their demise. Notably, calprotectin has been identified as a major antifungal protein in NETs, impacting the growth of pathogens like C. albicans and C. neoformans [31].Consequently, researchers frequently focus on these components to monitor the release and accumulation of NETs in diseased tissues through ex vivo immunofluorescence assays [11,32] enzyme-linked immunoassay tests [33],and flow cytometry tests [34].

Fig. 1. Mechanisms of NET formation. Diverse stimuli, including bacteria, fungi, cytokine, etc. combine with receptors and activate NADPH oxidase through the PKC-RAF/MERK/ERK signaling, inducing ROS production. ROS triggers the release of primary granule proteins,including NE and MPO.This sequence of processes ultimately leads to the formation and release of NETs.The formation and release of NETs is thought to occur by two different mechanisms: NETosis with neutrophil death and formation of NET without neutrophil death.NETosis involves the phosphorylation of NOX and the release of ROS following neutrophil stimulation, resulting in cell membrane rupture and NETs release. In contrast, during Another mechanism, Ca 2 + influxes into neutrophils upon receiving signals, triggering the formation of SK3 and mitochondrial ROS in small conductive potassium (SK) channels. Neutrophils release NETs in vesicular form, allowing them to survive.

## 4. Role of NETs in cardiovascular disease

## 4.1. Association of NETs with coronary heart disease

The underlying cause of coronary heart disease (CHD) is the formation of coronary atherosclerotic plaques [35]and intraluminal thrombosis [36].Coronary atherosclerosis (AS) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the arterial blood vessels, resulting from dysfunction in vascular endothelial cells (ECs),VSMCs, and various immune cells involved in its progression [37]. Endothelial dysfunction refers to a decrease in the production of endothelial NO, leading to increased permeability, expression of leukocyte adhesion molecules, leukocyte adhesion itself, as well as loss of anticoagulant properties and impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation [38].This dysfunction represents the earliest stage of atherosclerosis and mainly occurs in vulnerable areas of the vascular system [39,40], causing damage to endothelial cells and impairment of their function due to inflammatory stimuli, lipid accumulation, and compromised blood flow. In the later stages of coronary atherosclerosis, the death of VSMCs within plaques triggers severe vascular inflammation, collagen loss, and disruption in extracellular matrix integrity. This process results in thinning fibrous caps and eventual plaque rupture [41].

Borisov s ' study demonstrated a correlation between markers of NETs, such as MPO, NE, and CitH3, with the severity of coronary atherosclerosis and the onset of prothrombotic states. [42]. ECs, VSMCs, and macrophages are key players in coronary atherosclerosis development. NETs have been proposed as potential biomarkers for atherosclerosis [43].The DNA and granule proteins carried by NETs can activate plasmacytoid dendritic cells in the vessel wall, triggering a type I interferon response.Ultimately,this leads to exacerbation of AS [44]. NE, a component of NETs, contributes to atherosclerosis by inhibiting EC apoptosis [45].Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) activates MMP-2 in ECs [46],leading to endothelial dysfunction [47].Cholesterol crystals act as danger signals for atherosclerosis initiation, inducing IL-1 β production and release of NETs. These NETs activate NLRP3 inflammatory vesicles in macrophages, resulting in the secretion of pro-inflammatory

cytokine IL-1 β and recruitment of helper T-cell 17 (TH17) cells[48]to the atherosclerotic lesion[49],worsening atherosclerosis progression. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) is a key risk factor for atherosclerotic disease[50],and NETs activate macrophages to promote LDL oxidation into oxidized LDL (oxLDL), which is crucial for foam cell formation within macrophages. Awasthi et al.[13]also reported that oxLDL accelerates NETs formation, suggesting that components like lysophosphatidylcholine may play a role in this process.Cholesterol crystals (CC) have been identified as possible biomarkers for atherosclerosis. The interaction between CC and VSMCs leads to the creation of an inflammatory microenvironment, which plays a role in the progression of atherosclerosis by triggering IL-33-dependent neutrophil influx and the formation of NETs [51].

Endothelial dysfunction are key contributors to thrombosis in coronary arteries [52].The formation of a thrombus within the coronary lumen is dependent on platelet adhesion, activation, and aggregation [53]. Additionally, thrombus stability is maintained by large polymers such as fibronectin and von Willebrand factor (VWF) [54,55].NETs have been implicated in the pathogenesis of atherothrombotic diseases, including myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke. Studies have shown that acute myocardial infarction is associated with a high abundance of NETs within coronary thrombi [56].These NETs possess a negative charge and can enhance thrombin generation by activating platelets, as well as coagulation factors XI and XII, thereby accelerating thrombus formation [57]. Dimitrios A. Stakos et al. were the first to demonstrate that coronary thrombi form at sites where functional tissue factor (TF) is present, in conjunction with the local accumulation of NETs. Their findings revealed that blood neutrophils release NETs, exposing TF specifically in infarct-related coronary arteries (IRAs) among patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) [58], but not in non-IRAs. Moreover, TF is produced and released by neutrophils through transport via NETs [59].As a transmembrane protein, TF has a high affinity for plasma factors VII and VIIa [60], which convert plasminogen into thrombin - the central protease involved in coagulation processes and a potent activator of platelets. Thrombin then cleaves fibrinogen into fibrin strands and activates

glutamine aminotransferase factor XIII, responsible for promoting fibrin cross-linking and further stabilizing platelet-rich clots [61].This indicates that NETs bind to TF and enhance exogenous coagulation. Furthermore, the deposition of NETs increases fibronectin levels [62], enhancing platelet adhesion and thrombus formation by binding to plasma proteins like VWF [63].Activated platelets can also activate neutrophils, leading to the release of more NETs. In patients with coronary artery disease, elevated levels of myeloperoxidase-DNA complexes and neutrophil elastase in NETs positively correlate with increased thrombin levels [42].PAD4 released by NET formation contributes to thrombus formation by inhibition of ADAMTS13,a plasma enzyme that normally dismantles von Willebrand factor-generated clots, leading to acceleration of thrombus formation [64].

in the atherosclerosis formation process via multiple pathways. NETs promote thrombus formation by facilitating platelet adhesion and aggregation, binding red

blood cells, and supplying a scaffold for thrombus growth.NETs also stimulate coagulation factors and thrombin to facilitate the formation of blood clots.NETs have a role in atherosclerosis by causing damage to endothelial cells, stimulating immune cells, and facilitating the secretion of cytokines from immune cells.

## 5. Association of NETs with heart failure

The prevalence of heart failure (HF) is on the rise due to factors such as an aging population, global population growth, and improved survival rates post-diagnosis[65].HF is a complex syndrome marked by symptoms like dyspnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and reduced exercise tolerance [66].While the exact mechanisms linking NETs and HF have not been extensively studied, there is evidence to suggest that neutrophil infiltration significantly worsens myocardial dysfunction, pathological cardiac remodeling, and fibrosis [67]. Elevated levels of CitH3, a marker for NETs, have been found in the hearts of patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction(HFpEF) as well as in HFpEF mice, indicating that NETs may play a role in the underlying pathological processes of heart failure [68].There is also a study that employed a comprehensive analysis by combining single-cell sequencing and bulk transcriptome sequencing to elucidate the biological significance of NETs in HF from multiple perspectives. Using two machine learning algorithms, LASSO and random forest, the study identified five NETs-related biomarkers in HF patients: CXCR2, FCGR3B, VNN3, FPR2, and MPO, and experimental verification confirmed that the expression of the first four of these genes was significantly elevated in heart failure mice [69].Inhibiting NETs with DNase 1 reduces IL-10 expression in the heart, while increased IL-10 levels boost reactive oxygen species production in cardiac fibroblasts[68].This leads to an increase in fibroblast numbers, stimulating collagen deposition that impairs myocardial relaxation and increases myocardial stiffness. These changes promote myocardial fibrosis and result in diastolic dysfunction [70].

In a mouse model of angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced cardiomyopathy, KLF2 mRNA regulates neutrophil activation in response to Ang II at a molecular level, activating NETs to promote cardiac hypertrophy associated with HFpEF [71].In a previous study utilizing seipin/Bslc2 knockout mice, a lean diabetic model that developed HFpEF, researchers discovered that increased cardiac Titin phosphorylation and interstitial fibrosis associated with NETs led to left ventricular diastolic stiffness. Cardiac hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction were evident in these mice from 15 to 23 weeks of age. The hearts of these mice also showed elevated end-diastolic pressure/volume, increased end-diastolic pressure, left atrial enlargement, and exercise intolerance. By 24 weeks of age, there was a significant upregulation in mRNA and protein levels of cardiac inflammation and fibrosis markers like IL-6, TNFα , ICAM-1, and collagen 1. At 32 weeks of age, persistent NETs were observed as large extracellular structures releasing DNA fibers decorated with MPOs and guanosinated histones [72].The depletion of nitric oxide (NO) from

MPO activity within NETs led to protein chlorination or nitration, causing cardiac tissue damage crucial for the development and maintenance of chronic heart failure (CHF) [73].

SIRT3, an essential mitochondrial deacetylase involved in various physiological processes, was found to play a significant role in a mouse model with SIRT3 deficiency and an inflammatory environment. In this context, the presence of NETs resulted in an increase in bone marrowderived neutrophils. Reduced expression or deficiency of SIRT3 led to changes in cardiomyocyte glycolysis, myocardial hypertrophy, fibrosis, and reduced cardiac reserve capacity, ultimately impairing diastolic function and contributing to senile heart failure [74].Shohei Ichimura et al. [75]. found that pressure overload in patients with heart failure with dilated cardiomyopathy, may initiate mitochondrial DNA release in the myocardium, resulting in the formation of NETs. These NETs may further induce mitochondrial respiratory dysfunction, leading to a vicious cycle of developing cardiac dysfunction and failure.Interestingly in the present study, NETs have been shown to be associated with reduced cardiac systolic function rather than the extent of myocardial fibrosis in contrast to previous reports showing the involvement of NETs in organ fibrosis.

In addition, venous thrombosis, a potential complication, can present as congestive heart failure [76]. The role of NETs in venous thrombosis has been extensively researched, demonstrating their ability to activate platelets, induce granule secretion, promote adhesion, and facilitate spreading through the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4) pathway on platelets [77].

## 6. Association of NETs with myocardial infarction and myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury

Myocardial infarction (MI) is a condition characterized by a significant reduction or interruption of blood flow to a coronary artery, leading to ischemic myocardial necrosis. The pathogenesis of MI involves an inflammatory response, cardiomyocyte necrosis, and subsequent scar formation. [78]. Traditionally, MI is classified into two types: ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction [79]. NETs not only contribute to thrombosis formation,but also damage the endothelial cells [80], which may play a crucial role in the progression of myocardial infarction. Research by Xiaoqiong Wei et al. found that serum levels of NETs (MPO/DNA complexes) were significantly different from cardiac troponin I (cTnI), a biomarker for MI, and showed a positive correlation with it. In a mouse model of myocardial infarction, NETs were found to improve post-infarction cardiac function compared to the DNase I group. However, excessive DNA content within NETs led to poor cardiac remodeling through the TRL9 pathway and excessive collagen deposition due to macrophage polarization induced by interferon gene-stimulating factor [81]. The coronary NETs load in ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes has been identified as a predictor for both ST-segment regression and the size of the myocardial infarction area. It negatively correlates with ST-segment regression while positively correlating with the size of the myocardial infarction [82].The presence of NETs in coronary thrombi was associated with a worse prognosis soon after STEMI [83].

Myocardial ischaemia-reperfusion injury (I/RI) is the damage to myocardial cells and the inflammatory response that occurs when oxygenated blood is reintroduced after a period of myocardial ischaemia. This condition is commonly seen in cases such as myocardial infarction, acute heart attack, and trauma [84].Baba et al. [85]demonstrated a strong link between iron accumulation and cardiomyocyte death. Following cardiac ischaemia/reperfusion in adult mice, iron accumulates in cardiomyocytes around myocardial scars, leading to excessive iron-induced cardiomyocyte death. Peng Zhao and colleagues found that doxorubicin-induced release of High Mobility Group Box 1 (HMGB1) from NETs, followed by its binding to TLR4 on cardiomyocyte membranes, causes in vitro myocardial cell death due to excess iron

accumulation, resulting in myocardial injury [86].Studies have indicated that NETs accumulation and NETs-mediated microthrombosis can occur during myocardial I/RI, causing impaired blood flow ( no-reflow ) ' ' within the heart muscle and worsening of infarction. Targeted inhibition of NETs and fibronectin has been shown to improve patency of the coronary microvascular system, limit infarct size, and reduce post-infarction left ventricular remodeling[87].Yuting Feng et al. [88]. found that exosomes derived from mesenchymal stromal cells （ MSC-Exo ） preserved cardiac function after I/RI by inhibiting NETs formation through suppression of the NLRP3 signalling pathway, thereby reducing microvascular obstruction （ MVO ） production.NETs have been proven a crucial driver in MVO formation, which is related to adverse ventricular remodeling [89].Kun Yang et al. [90] discovered that the Glu504Lys mutation in the aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) gene worsens myocardial I/RI by promoting NETosis through activation of the leukotriene C4 (LTC4)/NOX2 pathway.NETs provide DNA scaffolds that promote coronary thrombosis [82,91], obstructing distal microcirculation within culprit arteries during reperfusion injury. This leads to tissue hypoperfusion and severe myocardial injury in I/RI models.

## 7. Association of NETs with pulmonary hypertension

Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is characterized by an increase in vascular resistance (PVR) due to excessive smooth muscle cell activity and abnormal deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) in the vessel wall. This results in elevated pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) and increased right ventricular (RV) workload. The RV adapts to this pathological condition by thickening its walls and increasing contractility. However, if compensatory mechanisms fail, it can lead to right heart failure (HF) and myocardial death [92]. PH is categorized into various types, such as pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH). Several factors, including oxidative stress, interleukin 8 (IL-8), tumor necrosis factor alpha, or ribonucleoprotein immune complexes, have been identified to induce the formation of NETs in experimental settings [93 -95]. Components of NETs, like MPO, can directly harm airway epithelial cells and endothelial cells [96], or indirectly contribute to lung tissue damage through autoimmune responses triggered by the abnormal accumulation of NETs [97]. Recent research has demonstrated that NETs can stimulate cytoskeletal remodeling and phenotypic transformation of PASMCs by activating the ILK/ -parvin/RAC1 β pathway mediated by a transmembrane protein known as convoluted helix structural domain containing 25 (CCDC25) [98]Cytoskeletal remodeling is crucial for PASMC function [99], while abnormal proliferation and phenotypic transformation are essential for the progression of PAH [100,101]. NETs promote endothelial angiogenesis and exacerbate PAH both in vivo and in vitro through the MPO/H2O2/NF-kB/TLR4 signaling pathway [102]. Kevin Didier found that NETosis persisted in patients with pulmonary hypertension induced by systemic sclerosis [103].The involvement of NETs in both arterial and venous systems has been discussed [104], emphasizing their role in the pathogenesis of CTEPH. Kesturu S. Girish s ' team discovered that ferroptosis mediated NETosis accelerated heme-induced pulmonary thrombosis in CTEPH patients [105].Not only that, NETs cause increased thrombus load and delayed regression through TGFβ signaling pathway-induced thrombus fibrosis.Venous thrombus translates into fibrotic vascular obstruction,leading to CTEPH [106].

Researchers have identified that MPO activation of the Rho kinase pathway drives pulmonary vasoconstriction and smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation as a constituent component of NETs [107]. Furthermore, NE release leads to ECM degradation, promoting adverse remodeling of pulmonary arteries [108]. Increased NE activity triggers MMP activation, enhancing ECM degradation [46].NE also inhibits BMPR2 signaling, causing vascular smooth muscle hyperproliferation [109]and excessive apoptosis in pulmonary artery endothelial cells

[110].Recent studies have found that PAH neutrophils produce an increase in NE, leading to a propensity to form NETs, and are characterized by increased adhesion and reduced transendothelial migration.extracellular vesicles(EVs) released from PAH neutrophils contain increased NE and HERV-K envelope and cause pulmonary hypertension in mice [111]. Neutrophil extracellular traps could create functional elafin resistance by shielding an NE pool from inhibition [110].

## 8. Association of NETs with atrial fibrillation

Atrial Fibrillation (AF) is the most common persistent clinical tachyarrhythmia, with atrial remodeling playing a significant role in its occurrence and persistence [112]. Inflammation is a key factor in atrial remodeling and AF pathogenesis [113], establishing a connection between NETs and AF. Mitochondrial dysfunction has been identified as a contributing factor to the onset and progression of AF, triggered by mitochondrial Ca 2 + overload and excessive ROS production [114]. meanwhile Yingqiang Guo s ' research team conducted experiments involving co-cultures of cardiomyocytes with NETs, which resulted in cardiomyocyte atrophy and an increase in lysosomes. Their findings suggest that NETs have the ability to trigger autophagic cell death and mitochondrial damage in cardiomyocytes by enhancing autophagy. When cardiomyocytes experience mitochondrial dysfunction, they release mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), which in turn stimulates the production of NETs. This creates a cycle where NETs contribute to further mitochondrial damage, creating a positive feedback loop that promotes the development of AF. [4].Ca 2 + overload has been linked to increased formation of NETs, contributing to the progression of AF [115]. The presence of NETs causes tissue damage leading to structural and electrical remodeling within the atria through direct endothelial cell killing and local microvascular thrombosis [113,116 -118]. These processes progressively impair atrial conduction while promoting reentry mechanisms that ultimately result in atrial fibrillation [119,120].Jie Xiang et al. found an increased vulnerability to AF in sepsis rats with NETs and NETs-related genes (NRGs), as evidenced by an increased AF inducibility, a prolonged AF duration, a slower atrial conduction velocity, and an increased conduction heterogeneity.DNase I is a targeted scavenger of NETs.All of the above adverse events were partially ameliorated when DNase I was used [121].

MPO, a component of NETs, plays a crucial role in myocardial remodeling and increases the susceptibility to AF [122].MPO, a component of NETs, plays a crucial role in myocardial remodeling and increases the susceptibility to AF [123].The researchers have discovered that plasma levels of MPO are elevated in patients with persistent AF compared to those with paroxysmal AF, suggesting a potential correlation between MPO and the advancement of AF. Furthermore, elevated plasma MPO levels have been associated with an increased likelihood of AF recurrence following catheter ablation. These results imply that monitoring MPO levels could serve as a valuable tool in predicting and addressing the progression and recurrence of AF [124].Eva R Meulendijks et al.found that epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) secretes MPO. MPO localizes in the area where epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) occurs. In patients with atrial cardiomyopathy, EMT of epicardial cells induces fibroblast and adipocyte proliferation, contributing to fibrofatty infiltration of the subepicardium[125].Furthermore, we recently reported EMT as an important mechanism underlying the formation of the fibrotic substrate in AF [126]. Interestingly, MPO-containing NETs were recently found to induce EMT in lung epithelial cells [127].

## 9. Association of NETs with Ferroptosis

Induced by tiny compounds with iron ion dependency,ferroptosis is a novel form of oxidative cell death revealed lately. This phenomenon arises due to the disruption of the equilibrium between the generation and breakdown of ROS within cells. In the metabolic imbalance of ROS,

both ferroptosis and the creation of NETs are implicated in relevant processes. Hence, it is imperative to elucidate the correlation between NETs and ferroptosis in the cardiopulmonary and vascular systems.

Liang Chen and colleagues [128]discovered that NETs stimulate the development of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) by causing iron depletion in SMCs as a result of blocking the PI3K/AKT pathway. Nevertheless, the use of PI3K agonists, ferroptosis inhibitors, and induction of PAD4 deficiency effectively inhibited accumulation of AAA. Moreover, both in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that NETs reduced the stability and dimerization of mitochondrial glutathione transporter protein (SLC25A11), resulting in a depletion of mitochondrial glutathione (mitoGSH). This depletion subsequently caused ferroptosis in SMCs and facilitated the development of AAA [129].

NETs have been shown to increase the expression of methyltransferase 3 (METTL3) by activating the TLR9 / MyD88 / NF-k β pathway. METTL3 acts as a crucial factor in sepsis-related acute lung damage by facilitating the alteration of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) mRNA at m6A and increasing ferroptosis in alveolar epithelial cells. Reduced expression of PAD4 may inhibit the development of NETs, hence mitigating sepsis-induced iron lethality [130].Yuxin Fei and colleagues [131]discovered that a significant amount of NETs in sepsis patients and experimental models disrupted the glycocalyx component of pulmonary vascular endothelial cells. This disruption impairs the integrity of the complex between the core protein SDC-1 and the side-chain HS of the glycocalyx, which in turn interferes with the downstream HGF/cMET signaling pathway. As a result, endothelial cells undergo ferroptosis, worsening acute lung injury.

During intestinal ischemia/reperfusion (II/R), neutrophils were seen to invade, stimulate, and generate NETs in intestinal microvessels. The excessive release of NETs disrupts the regulation of mitochondrial quality in intestinal microvascular endothelial cells, which is mediated by FUNDC1. Impaired mitochondrial function in endothelial cells causes the buildup of ROS and the peroxidation of lipids. This finally results in an elevated ferroptosis in endothelial cells and initiates damage to the intestinal vascular barrier [132]. Dysregulation of the intestinal flora may occur in conjunction with damage to the intestinal wall. Moreover, the involvement of gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease has been extensively investigated in recent times. Experimental investigations on cardiac ischemia-reperfusion injury revealed the aberrant accumulation of iron surrounding the affected myocardium [121]. Previous studies have shown that cardiac ischemia-reperfusion injury is accompanied by the development of NETs [123]. The putative association between NETs and I/RI via the ferroptosis mechanism can be further explored.

## 10. Cardiovascular disease treatment regimens targeting NETs

Recent studies have highlighted the significant role of NETs in the pathogenesis of CVD.NETs are implicated in promoting CVD progression by fostering an inflammatory microenvironment [51].Research has indicated that inhibiting NETs can effectively reduce inflammation and mitigate further damage under certain circumstances. Consequently, targeting NETs therapeutically for the prevention and management of CVD may necessitate consideration of variables such as disease stage, comorbidities, and the extent of inflammation. Tailoring treatment options based on individual patient characteristics is paramount in this context.

PAD4 inhibitor: PAD4 is a protease responsible for catalyzing the guanylation of arginine residues and is involved in NETosis. The inhibitor features a CL-acetamidine moiety that forms an irreversible and covalent bond with Cys645 located in the active site of PAD4, demonstrating a strong specificity towards PAD4. [132]. 2) Deoxyribonuclease I: DNase I, an enzyme that specifically cleaves DNA, is a crucial factor in the formation of NETs. In research settings, DNase I has been commonly used to prevent the formation of NETs [133].Previous studies by Farrera et al. have shown that the clearance of NETs relies on both DNase I and

macrophages. Specifically, they discovered that at high concentrations of DNase I, NETs were effectively broken down, while at the physiological concentration of 20 ng/mL, this degradation was not observed. This process may enhance the clearance of NETs by macrophages, possibly by breaking down the DNA backbone into more manageable fragments. [134]. 3) Antioxidants: ROS play a critical role in the generation of NETs [135]. Zeng and colleagues found that antioxidants are able to effectively suppress the production of ROS and the release of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) from activated neutrophils [136]. Additionally, their study showed that antioxidants that can significantly inhibit the release of ROS from neutrophils also hinder the formation of NETs that depend on ROS [137].4) Anticoagulants: Heparin is a multifunctional glycosaminoglycan with anticoagulant activity and antithrombotic effects. It inhibits neutrophil activation to produce NETs, while promoting their catabolism. This process leads to the release of histone proteins due to chromatin structure destabilization and DNA stability disruption, ultimately disrupting the coagulation effect caused by NETs [91,138,139]. 5 ） Colchicine ： Experiments have shown that colchicine reduces NADPH oxidase-2/NOX2/ROS production and calcium ion Ca 2 + influx, thereby decreasing the cardiovascular disease burden caused by excessive accumulation of NETs. [140,141].6) Statins and metformin: Statins and metformin have also demonstrated efficacy in improving heart failure by exerting anti-inflammatory effects associated with NETosis. Specifically, simvastatin and metformin can effectively inhibit the formation of NETs, lower plasma levels of MPO, and decrease the number of neutrophils in peripheral blood [142,143]. 7) Vitamin D: Vitamin D has been found to alleviate ROS production, endothelial dysfunction, and apoptosis, [144]. suggesting its potential in reducing NETs production.

## 11. Conclusions

Since the initial discovery of NETs in 2004, research articles on this topic have been steadily increasing, indicating a growing relevance of NETs across various fields. NETs are often seen as a two-sided phenomenon - while they are a crucial part of neutrophil defense mechanisms against invasion, unchecked NET formation has been linked to organ damage. Recent studies have highlighted the association of NETs, along with their markers like MPO and NE, with cardiovascular diseases.

While previous research primarily focused on the role of NETs in the development of coronary artery disease, current studies have expanded to investigate their involvement in various conditions including atrial fibrillation, heart failure, ischemia-reperfusion injury, and ferroptosis. However, there is still limited research on the connection between NETs and ventricular arrhythmias in arrhythmia-related diseases, highlighting the need for further exploration. Recent findings have shown that ferroptosis in endothelial cells, mediated by the TLR4/NLRP3 inflammatory vesicle signaling pathway, can induce pulmonary hypertension in rats [145].Previous studies have also examined the relationship between NETs and ferroptosis [146]. However, the specific association of NETs with PAH through endothelial cell ferroptosis has not been clearly demonstrated. Moreover, in studies on cellular ferroptosis, NETs have been shown to impact the development of abdominal aortic aneurysms by modulating ferroptosis through the inhibition of the PI3K pathway [128].NETs contribute to cardiovascular diseases by influencing cardiomyocyte ferroptosis via the HMGB1/TLR4/YAP pathway, resulting in myocardial injury [86].Further research is necessary to determine if NETs also affect ferroptosis through other signaling pathways.The mechanism of NETs-induced thrombosis remains a key area of investigation, particularly in its relevance to various cardiovascular diseases like atrial fibrillation and pulmonary hypertension. However, there is a lack of research on hypertension, a prevalent cardiovascular condition, in relation to NETs. This gap may be attributed to the transient nature of NETs activity and challenges in constructing animal models of NETs-associated hypertension.A recent study discovered that hypertension may be linked to the acceleration of

vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation by NETs through AKT/CDKN1b/TK1, rather than smooth muscle cell apoptosis [147]. Further research is required to investigate if NETs can induce hypertension by triggering vascular phenotypic changes through alternative pathways.

Studies are increasingly considering NETs as a potential target for addressing cardiovascular diseases. Anti-inflammatory agents have received much attention in recent years. In particular, colchicine has not only been shown to be effective in the treatment of atherosclerosis [148],but has also been found to inhibit the formation of NETs by reducing NOX2/ROS production and Ca 2 + influx [149]. Additionally, DAMPs, especially those from mitochondria, seem to play a significant role in triggering NETosis [150,151]. Strategies aimed at interfering with these signals could offer promising avenues to reduce excessive NET release and address cardiovascular disease processes effectively.
