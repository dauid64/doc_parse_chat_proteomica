## Discussion

The Fas/FasL  system  is  acknowledged to  play  a critical role  in the  regulation f  both T  cell nd B  cell evelopo a d ment (19,  20, 22-27,  45).  Whereas quiescent   cells ack T l FasL expression, hysiologic  activation  T  cells  in rep of sponse  to  a number of  stimuli nduces  FasL expression nd i a upregulation  f  Fas,  whose ensuing  engagement on the  cell o surface nitiates   autocrine  ell eath  pathway (22-25). n i an c d I this  manner, T cells  appear not to be  committed but, rather, ust be induced by activation  ignals o undergo m s t apoptosis.

Our findings nvoke  a different enario or the  as/FasL i sc f F pathway in  neutrophils.  ur results  ot  only  confirm  that O n Fas  is onstitutively ressed n human  neutrophils, noc exp o mo cytes, nd eosinophils  16,  46),  but they  also  demonstrate a ( that, mong  normal mature phagocytes, asL expression  s a F i restricted  neutrophils  Figs.  1 and 2).  This constitutive to ( coexpression f  Fas and FasL suggests  a plausible echao m nism responsible  or  the  rapid ate f  spontaneous poptosis f r o a observed  in mature human  neutrophils.  nlike mature T U cells, hich  must be activated o undergo Fas-rnediated w t

Our  results emonstrate  differential  sensitivity  g d amon neutrophils, nocytes,  and eosinophils  o  Fas-induced popmo t a tosis Fig.  3).  Although all hree  types  of  phagocytes ere ( t w shown  to express  cell-surface s,  only neutrophils  ere Fa w found to undergo rapid  apoptosis  after timulation ith s w mAb  CH-11. In  monocytes,  mAb  CH-11 induced  a modest, lbeit  tatistically  nificant,  gree  of  DNA a s sig de fragmentation.  hus, the  observed  magnitude of  apoptosis n our T i study  differs  rom a previous eport,  uggesting  hat onof r s t m cytes  exhibit elatively gh sensitivity    the  Fas apoptotic r hi to pathway  (49).  Moreover, the relative sensitivity he of t phagocyte  populations o  Fas-induced  apoptosis orrelated t c with the  relative  ate f  spontaneous poptosis bserved  in r o a o vitro  (i.e.,  eutrophils monocytes  &gt;eosinophils) 6-16, n &gt; ( 46).

Of the m proinflammatory  ytokines  nvestigated   our  study, -CSF c i in G exerted  the strongest  ffect n reducing  spontaneous  58) e o ( and Fas-induced eutrophil  poptosis  Figs.   and 5).  Lesser n a ( 4 but significant  eductions n Fas-induced  apoptosis ere r i w observed  with  GM-CSF, IFN-%  and TNF-o~  (Fig. ).  To4 gether,  these  findings re consistent  ith the hypothesis a w that  proinflammatory  cytokines  and  glucocorticoids  uppress eutrophil  poptosis  ia  inhibition  f  a component of n a v o the  Fas  death  program.

The  mechanism  by which  proinflammatory  cytokines and glucocorticoids diate  their ntiapoptotic fects  as me a ef h yet  to  be determined. e W doubt that  simple  downregulation  of  cell-surface  s  expression  s nvolved,  ased  on our Fa i i b observation  hat ncubation ith  G-CSF  in  vitro ails  o  alt i w f t ter  the  MFI  signal or  Fas in  flow cytometry  experiments f (data  not  shown).

portant ntracellular  ssenger  of  the  Fas  death  pathway in i me several  cell  types,  including  lymphocytes (51, 52). Although we  cannot  exclude  the  possibility  at  ceramide  is th an Fas-induced ntracellular  ssenger  of  apoptosis  n  neui me i trophils,  e  have failed  o  observe  accelerated  poptosis  n w t a i neutrophils  reated  ith  C 2  ceramide  (Liles,  .C., and S.J. t w W Klebanoff,  unpublished  data),  cell  permeable,  synthetic a analogue  of  endogenous free eramide  capable  of  inducing c apoptosis  n  other ell ypes  (51,  52).  Fas  activation s  also i c t ha been found to  stimulate  n elevation  n the  concentration a i of  cytosolic  a  2+ in  certain  ell ypes  (53). lthough a  poC c t A tential  ole or  a  Fas-mediated a  2+ signal  as  yet  to  be der f C h scribed  in phagocytes, t  is  interesting  note that  small, i to transient  levations  n  intracelluar    2+ have  been reported e i Ca to  paradoxically hibit  poptosis  n  normal  human  neutroin a i phils 54).

Induction  of  antiapoptotic  ncogene expression epreo r sents  another  potential  echanism for  inhibition  f  apopm o tosis. Bd-2 and related ncogenes such as o bcl-x have received substantial  ttention  because of their  ability o a t inhibit  poptosis  n  a variety f  systems  (55-57), ncluding a i o i hematopoietic  development (58, 59).
