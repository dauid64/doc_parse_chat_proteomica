## A B S T R A C T

Metabolic rewiring is essential for tumor growth and progression to metastatic disease, yet little is known regarding how cancer cells modify their acquired metabolic programs in response to different metastatic microenvironments. We have previously shown that liver-metastatic breast cancer cells adopt an intrinsic metabolic program characterized by increased HIF-1 α activity and dependence on glycolysis. Here, we confirm by in vivo stable isotope tracing analysis (SITA) that liver-metastatic breast cancer cells retain a glycolytic profile when grown as mammary tumors or liver metastases. However, hepatic metastases exhibit unique metabolic adaptations including elevated expression of genes involved in glutathione (GSH) biosynthesis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) detoxification when compared to mammary tumors. Accordingly, breast-cancer-liver-metastases exhibited enhanced de novo GSH synthesis. Confirming their increased capacity to mitigate ROS-mediated damage, liver metastases display reduced levels of 8-Oxo-2 -deoxyguanosine. Depletion of the catalytic subunit ' of the rate-limiting enzyme in glutathione biosynthesis, glutamate-cysteine ligase (GCLC), strongly reduced the capacity of breast cancer cells to form liver metastases, supporting the importance of these distinct metabolic adaptations.

Loss of GCLC also affected the early steps of the metastatic cascade, leading to decreased numbers of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and impaired metastasis to the liver and the lungs. Altogether, our results indicate that GSH metabolism could be targeted to prevent the dissemination of breast cancer cells.

## 1. Introduction

Metastasis, which involves the dissemination of cancer cells from the primary tumor to distant organs/tissues, is the most devastating stage of breast cancer progression. Breast cancer cells exhibit specific metastatic tropisms and spread locally to the lymph nodes or disseminate distally to

the bones, lungs, liver or brain [1]. Metastasis is often depicted as a complex multi-step process consisting of specific cellular activities including the acquisition of migratory and invasive capabilities in the primary tumor, intravasation of cancer cells into the bloodstream and survival in circulation; extravasation of cancer cells into the parenchyma of a distant organ or tissue, and cancer cell proliferation to form

macro-metastases [2]. Each step along the metastatic cascade presents unique metabolic challenges that must be overcome by cancer cells to successfully metastasize.

Growing evidence supports the concept that cancer cells with the greatest degree of metabolic flexibility are the most metastatically fit [3]. Metabolic re-wiring favors the use of readily available substrates at different stages of the metastatic cascade; increases metabolite availability to fuel biosynthetic pathways; ensures ROS homeostasis and ATP synthesis, which together support the bioenergetic requirements for cancer cell proliferation. Metabolic flexibility ensures that disseminating cells can adapt to microenvironments that differ in nutrient availability, oxygen, trophic factors and stromal cues [4 -6].

Using organ-selective variants of the 4T1 murine triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell line, we previously identified metabolic profiles associated with organ-specific metastasis. We, and others, found that highly metastatic breast cancer cells differentially engage oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and glycolysis to efficiently metastasize and that distinct metabolic profiles may dictate metastatic fitness to distinct organs [7,8]. Liver-metastatic breast cancer cells display increased conversion of glucose-derived pyruvate into lactate and a concomitant reduction in mitochondrial metabolism. This occurs via the engagement of HIF-1 α and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase1 (PDK1), which inhibits pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) to prevent the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA [7]. In contrast, breast cancer cells disseminating to the lungs and bones display elevated respiratory capacities compared to cells metastasizing to the liver and are characterized by higher expression of PPARG coactivator 1 alpha (PGC-1 α ), which mediates mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative phosphorylation [7,9,10].

These data argue that breast cancer cells engage specific intrinsic metabolic strategies that confer optimal metastatic fitness. However, whether cancer cells can respond to stresses imposed by distinct steps in the metastatic cascade by further altering their preferred metabolic programs remains an understudied question. In this study, we explored metabolic adaptations induced by the metastatic liver microenvironment. To do so, we employed liver-metastatic 4T1 breast cancer cells grown either as mammary tumors or liver metastases. Animals bearing these distinct cancerous lesions were subjected to in vivo infusions with uniformly 13 C-labelled glucose or glutamine followed by stable isotope tracing analysis (SITA). Our results indicate that breast cancer cells maintain their HIF-1 α driven glycolytic phenotype both at the primary site and within the liver. Yet, we identified metabolic adaptations in liver metastases that support enhanced glutathione biosynthesis which we functionally show to be essential for the successful formation of hepatic metastases.

## 2. Material and methods

## 2.1. Animals

Female Balb/c mice (5 weeks old) were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA). Animals were housed in facilities managed by the McGill University Animal Resources Center and all animal experiments were conducted under a McGill Universityapproved Animal Use Protocol (AUP#MCGL-5129). Experiments involving live animals were subjected to peer review for scientific merit, in accordance with guidelines established by the Canadian Council on Animal Care.

## 2.2. Cell culture and stable cell lines

The murine 4T1 breast cancer cell line (parental) used in this study was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and cultured according to their guidelines. All 4T1-derived subpopulations were generated by in vivo selection as previously described [11,12]. 4T1-2776 and 4T1-2792 cells (liver metastatic subpopulations of 4T1cells) were cultivated at 37 · C in a humidified incubator with 5 %

CO2 in DMEM (Cat. #: 319-005-CL, Wisent) containing 10 % fetal bovine serum (Cat. #: 12483-020, GIBCO), 100 U/mL penicillin (Cat. #: 450-201-EL, Wisent), 1 mmol/Sodium Pyruvate (Cat. #: 600-110-EL, Wisent), 1.5 g/L Sodium Bicarbonate (Cat. #: 609-105-EL, Wisent) and 10 mmol/Hepes (Cat. #: 330-050-EL, Multicell).

## 2.3. Mammary fat pad, intrahepatic, splenic and tail vein injections

For tumor growth studies, 1 × 10 3 4T1-2776 or 4T1-2792 breast cancer cells were injected into the fourth mammary gland of 6- to 8-wkold female Balb/c mice, and tumor volumes were determined as described previously described [12]. For experimental liver metastasis assays, 1 × 10 5 4T1-2776 were injected into the spleens of 6- to 8-wk-old female Balb/c mice as previously described. Following splenic implantation, liver metastases were allowed to form for up to 2 or 3 weeks before sample collection, according to the experimental end-point [12]. For intrahepatic injections, 1 × 10 4 4T1-2776 liver-aggressive cells were injected in the cardiac lobe of the liver of 8- to 10-wk-old female Balb/c mice. Following intrahepatic implantation, liver metastases were allowed to form in mice for up to 2 weeks before sample collection. Tumor burden in the liver was quantified using Imagescope software (Aperio).

Tail vein injections were performed by injecting 2 × 10 5 4T1-2776 cells directly into the lateral tail vein of Balb/c mice. After four weeks, all mice were sacrificed, and lungs were removed and the metastatic lesion area was quantified. The metastatic burden in the lungs was quantified from four Hematoxylin and Eosin (H &amp; E) stained step sections (40 μ m/step). The metastatic lesion area/lung area was quantified using Imagescope software (Aperio). For spontaneous metastasis experiments using human breast cancer cells, 2.5 × 10 5 MDA-MB-231 cells were injected into the fourth mammary gland of 6- to 8-wk-old female NSG mice. Tumors were allowed to reach a volume of 500 -600 mm 3 prior to resection. Mice were sacrificed 12 days post tumor resection and metastatic burden in the distal sites was quantified.

## 2.4. Laser capture microdissection

All tissues were examined by a clinical pathologist (MCG) to identify distinct regions of tumor and non-tumor tissue prior to microdissection. H &amp; E-stained sections were micro-dissected using a PixCell IIe LCM system (Arcturus) within 3 h following staining. Breast cancer cells and normal hepatocytes were captured on CapSure Macro LCM Caps (Applied Biosystems), using an infrared laser with a spot size of 15 μ m and a duration of 3 ms. A minimum of 500 laser pulses were applied to ensure the capture of sufficient cell numbers for RNA extraction. Debris or unwanted cells that were acquired in the process were removed using CapSure Cleanup Pads (Applied Biosystems).

## 2.5. RNA isolation, amplification, labelling, and hybridization to microarrays

Total RNA (1 -80 ng) from micro-dissected material was isolated with a PicoPure RNA Isolation Kit (Cat. #: KIT0204, Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer s protocol and quality was verified using ' a 2100 Bioanalyzer platform (Agilent Technologies). Extracted RNA (5 ng) or universal mouse reference RNA (Cat. #: 740100, Stratagene) was linearly amplified using the RiboAmp HS PLUS RNA Amplification Kit (Cat. #: KIT0525, Applied Biosystems) and profiles of amplified RNA (aRNA) were assessed using the 2100 Bioanalyzer platform (Agilent). Micro-dissected aRNA (5 μ g) was then labelled with Cy3dye (Cat. #: KIT0609, Applied Biosystems) while universal mouse reference aRNA was labelled with Cy5dye (Cat. #: KIT0610, Applied Biosystems). Dye incorporation was measured using a Nanodrop ND-1000 UV-VIS spectrophotometer. Labelled RNA (300 ng) was then hybridized to SurePrint G3 Hmn GE 8 × 60K Microarrays (Cat. #: G4851A, Agilent Technologies) 60K whole mouse genome microarray gene expression chips

(Agilent Technologies) in a rotating hybridization oven for 17 h at 65 · C. Microarray chips were then washed, dried, and scanned (Agilent Technologies, model G2505B) according to the manufacturer s ' protocol (manual ID #G4140-90050).

## 2.6. Microarray data processing

Microarray data were extracted using Feature Extraction Software v.9.5.3.1 (Agilent Technologies). Processing of the output files was performed with the R Bioconductor package LIMMA (Linear Models for Microarray Data), version 3.14.4. The raw data were normalized using half background correction (offset of 50), LOESS within array and quantile between array normalization. Probe signals that did not reach a minimum criterion for quality were flagged and filtered out. The most variant probe was chosen to represent the gene expression level when multiple probes mapped to the same gene. Batch correction was done with the ComBat [13] function in the R Bioconductor package SVA. After batch correction, a linear model was fit to the series of microarrays. Estimated coefficients and standard errors were computed. Empirical Bayes smoothing was applied to the standard errors. P-values were adjusted to control for the false discovery rate using the Benjamini-Hochberg method [14]. The arrays were clustered, after batch correction, according to the Euclidean distance between the expression levels of all the genes. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) [15] was performed on the complete list of genes ranked by the t-statistic for the class comparison of interest. GSEA was performed against the MSigDB [15] gene ontology gene sets. The microarray data can be accessed through the GEO repository (ID GSE238214).

## 2.7. KEGG pathway analyses

The differentially expressed genes (Fig. 1D) were submitted to KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) pathway analyses (Fig. 1E) for functional and characteristic classification of enriched genes. Genes were entered and analyzed using Enrichr (https://amp. pharm.mssm. edu/Enrichr), an online analysis tool. The upregulated pathways were sorted according to their P values.

## 2.8. Steady-state analysis of metabolites in primary mammary tumors and liver metastasis

Steady-state metabolite abundances were determined using targeted Liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC --MS/MS) and multiple reaction monitoring (MRM). Flash-frozen breast tumor and liver metastases were crushed to powder using a liquid nitrogen-cooled mortar and pestle. Tumor powder (10 mg) was lysed in 1,140 μ L of methanol in HPLC-grade water (50:50 (v/v)) supplemented with 1 mg/mL of NEthylmaleimide (NEM) (Cat. #E3876, Sigma) to protect thiol groups (glutathione, cysteine, homocysteine), 660 μ L of ice-cold acetonitrile (ACN) and six ceramic beads (2.88 mm diameter) (Cat. #: 19-646-3, Omni International). The mixture was homogenized in a bead beater (Qiagen TissueLyser) for 2 min at 30 Hz. Next, 600 μ L of ice-cold dichloromethane and 900 μ L of ice-cold HPLC-grade water were added and samples were vortexed for 1 min, left on ice for 10 min and then centrifuged for 10 min at 1500 g, 1 · C. Water-soluble metabolites were collected from the upper phase and dried using a chilled vacuum centrifuge at GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 4 · C (Labconco). Samples were resuspended in 50 μ L of HPLC-grade water before LC-MS/MS analysis.

Asample volume of 5 mL was injected for data collection. Metabolite separation was achieved by using a 1290 UPLC equipped with a Zorbax Extend C18 column [1.8 μ m, 2.1 × 150 mm 2 ] with guard column [1.8 μ m, 2.1 × 5 mm 2 ] (Agilent Technologies). The chromatographic gradient started at 100 % mobile phase A (97 % water, 3 % methanol, 10 mM tributylamine, 15 mM acetic acid, 5 μ M medronic acid) for 2.5 min, followed by a 5-min gradient to 20 % mobile phase C (methanol, 10 mM tributylamine, 15 mM acetic acid, 5 μ M medronic acid), a 5.5-

adient to 45 % C and a 7-min gradient to 99 % C at a flow rate of 0.25 mL/min. This was followed by a 4-min hold time at 100 % mobile phase C. The column was back-washed with 99 % mobile phase D (90 % ACN) for 3 min at 0.25 mL/min, followed by an increase of the flow rate to 0.8 mL/min over 0.5 min and a 3.85-min hold, after which the flow rate was decreased to 0.6 mL/min over 0.15 min. The column was then re-equilibrated at 100 % A over 0.75 min, during which the flow rate was decreased to 0.4 mL/min, and held for 7.65 min. One minute before the next injection, the flow was returned to forward flow at 0.25 mL/min. The column temperature was maintained at 35 · C.

Eluting metabolites were ionized using Agilent JetStream tm electrospray ionization source operating in negative mode. The source-gas temperature and flow were set at 150 · C and 13 L/min, respectively, the nebulizer pressure was set at 45 psi, and capillary voltage was set at 2000 V on either QTOF or QQQ instruments. Eluants were detected by a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (6470 QQQ Agilent). Dynamic multiple reaction monitoring (dMRM) was used for the detection of 269 metabolites (207 in range curves, 34 validated (not in calibration curves) and 28 compounds from the Agilent Ion pairing library (not fully validated by the facility). Retention time and MRM transitions were optimized using authentic standards for all validated compounds.

Metabolite saturation levels were determined from external curves for commonly detected central carbon metabolites. The area under the curve for each sample and metabolite was analyzed and confirmed to be below the saturation limit (for those metabolites where range curves were available). No corrections or allowances were made for ion suppression effects. Repeat injections of authentic standards were performed throughout the targeted or stable isotope tracer runs to observe any shifts in retention time or chromatographic quality. The area under the curve for each 1) sample, 2) metabolite and 3) isotope were analyzed using Mass Hunter Quant (Agilent Technologies) and confirmed to be below the saturation limit (for those metabolites where range curves were available). No corrections or allowances were made for ion suppression effects. In cases of saturating signals, 15X dilutions were used.

## 2.9. Stable isotope tracer analysis

Stable isotope tracer analysis was carried out as previously described [16], with some modifications. Mice harboring primary mammary tumors or liver metastases (intrahepatic injections) of 4T1-2776 cells were deprived of food for 6 h before infusions. Mice were anesthetized using Isoflurane (Fresenius Kabi, Cat. #: CP0406V2) and maintained on a heating pad for the infusion process. Infusions were carried out by placing a catheter (Millpledge, Cat. #: MP06126) in the lateral tail vein. U-[ 13 C6]-glucose (Cat. #: CLM-1396-1, Cambridge Isotope Lab) was dissolved in saline at 100 mg/mL, an initial bolus of 120 μ L (12 mg U-[ 13 C6]-glucose) was administered, followed by a continuous infusion at 2.5 μ L/min for a duration of 2.5 h. For glutamine infusions, U-[ 13 C5]-glutamine (Cat. #: 184161-19-1, Cambridge Isotope Lab) was dissolved in saline at 40 mg/mL solution, an initial bolus of 150 μ L (6 mg U-[ 13 C5]-glutamine) was administered, followed by a continuous rate of 3 μ L/min for 2.5 h. Blood samples of ~20 μ L were obtained every 30 min via saphenous bleed as controls to analyze isotopic enrichment. At the experimental endpoint, tumors, muscle and distal liver tissue were harvested and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Tissues were then pulverized on liquid nitrogen using a mortar and pestle.

Citric acid cycle and glycolytic intermediates were measured by gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Tissue powder (10 mg) -from breast tumors or liver metastases was lysed in 1000 μ L of ice-cold 80 % methanol in HPLC-grade water and six ceramic beads (2.88 mm diameter) and sonicated. The mixture was homogenized in a bead beater (Qiagen TissueLyser) for 2 min at 30 Hz and samples were vortexed for 1 min, and centrifuged for 10 min at 19,000 g, 1 · C. Supernatants were supplemented with an internal control (750 ng of myristic acid-d27) and dried using a chilled vacuum centrifuge at GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 4 · C (Labconco). Pellets were solubilized with 10 mg Methoxyamine hydrochloride in pyridine,

incubated 30 min at 70 · C and derivatized with 70 μ L of N-tert-Butyldimethylsilyl-N- methyltrifluoroacetamide (MTBSTFA) for 1 h at 70 · C. Immediately after incubation, samples were subjected to GC/MS analysis using an Agilent 5975C GC/MS equipped with a DB-5MS + DG (30 m × 250 μ mx0.25 μ m) capillary column (Agilent J &amp; W, Santa Clara, CA, USA). All samples were injected three times: twice using scan (50 -700 m/z ) mode (1X and 15X dilution) and once using selected ion monitoring (SIM) mode. A volume of 1 μ L of the derivatized sample was injected into the GC in splitless mode with inlet temperature set to 280 · C and electron impact set at 70 eV. Helium was used as the carrier gas with a flow rate such that 2 H27-myristic acid eluted at approximately 18 min. The quadrupole was set at 150 · C and the GC/MS interface at 285 · C. The oven program started at 60 · C held for 1 min, then increased at a rate of 10 · C/min until 320 · C. Bake-out was at 320 · C for 10 min. All metabolites used in this study were previously validated using authentic standards to confirm mass spectra and retention times. Integration of ion intensities (generally M57 ion) was done using the Agilent Mass Hunter Quant software (Agilent Technologies). Mass isotopomer distribution analysis was carried out using an in-house algorithm adapted from previously described methods [17]. Total amounts of each metabolite were normalized per mg of tumor tissue.

Tracing the incorporation of 13 C from glucose and glutamine into glutathione was detected by high-resolution LC-MS following the same extraction protocol described above without thiol protection. Pellets were solubilized in HPLC water and 5 μ L was injected into an Agilent 6540 UHD Accurate-Mass Q-TOF LC/MS system coupled to ultra-high pressure liquid chromatography (UHPLC, 1290 Infinity LC System). The chromatography methods and ion source were the same as noted above for LC-MS/MS analyses. Repeat injections of authentic standards were performed throughout the stable isotope tracer runs to observe any shifts in retention time or monitor chromatographic quality. Stable isotope tracer data were analyzed, and natural abundance matrix corrections were performed using Profinder software (Agilent Technologies). For all stable isotope tracer studies, control experimental samples were prepared that were not exposed to 13 C6-glucose or 13 C5-glutamine to ensure that observed 13 C incorporation is not an interfering ion.

Primers used in this study are listed in Supplementary Materials (SI Table 2).

## 2.13. Immunohistochemistry

Mammary tumors were fixed overnight in formalin, embedded in paraffin and sectioned by the Goodman Cancer Institute (GCI) Histology Core Facility. Sections were stained using routine immunohistochemical protocols provided by the GCI Histology Core. For 8-oxo-dG staining, no antigen retrieval was performed before tissue sections were incubated with the anti-8-oxo-dG antibody (1:2000 dilution) (Cat. #: 4354MC050, Trevigen) and slides were treated with the Mouse-on-Mouse immunodetection kit according to manufacturer s ' protocol (Cat. #: BMK-2202, Vector Laboratories). Slides were scanned using a ScanScope XT Digital Slide Scanner (Aperio), and data were analyzed using Image Scope software.

## 2.14. CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing

Gclc was deleted from 4T1-2776 cells by CRISPR/Cas9 genomic editing approaches using the following single-guide RNA 5-' GTCCAGTTGTTACTGAATGG-3 ' determined using the CRISPR Design Tool (http://www.e-crisp.org/E-CRISP) [20]. The sequence was cloned into the lentiCRISPRv2 vector (Cat. #: 52961, Addgene). Viral particles were produced by co-transfecting lentiCRISPRv2Gclc with the packaging plasmids pVSVg (Cat. #: 8454, AddGene) and psPAX2 (Cat. #: 12260, AddGene) via calcium phosphate transfection of HEK-293T cells. Infected 4T1-2776 cells were selected with 2 μ g/mL puromycin (Cat. #: ant-pr-1, Invivogen) and puromycin-resistant cells were subcloned to obtain individual Gclc KO cell lines. Throughout the subcloning process, cells were cultured in the presence of 100 μ MN-Acetyl-L-Cysteine (NAC) (Cat. #: A7250, Sigma). Silencing of GCLC was validated by immunoblot analysis.

## 2.15. Generation of shRNA-mediated stable knockdown cell lines

MDA-MB-231 shControl and MDA-MB-231 shGclc cells were generated using 2 different short hairpins or an empty vector control (pLKO.1puro). shRNA sequences used in this study are listed in Supplementary Materials (SI Table 2). shRNA vectors were obtained from the McGill Platform for Cellular Perturbation (MPCP). Viral particles were produced by co-transfecting the viral vectors with packaging plasmids (pVSVg [Cat. #: 8454, AddGene] and psPAX2 [Cat. #: 12260, AddGene]) via calcium phosphate transfection of HEK-293T cells. Infected cells were selected with 2 μ g/mL puromycin (Cat. #: ant-pr-1, Invivogen) and puromycin-resistant cells were subcloned to obtain individual sh Gclc cell lines. Throughout the subcloning process, cells were cultured in the presence of 100 μ M N-Acetyl-L-Cysteine (NAC) (Cat. #: A7250, Sigma). Silencing of GCLC was validated with RT-qPCR and immunoblot analyses.

## 2.16. GSH determination

GSHquantification from breast cancer cell lines was performed using a GSH-Glo kit (Cat. #: V6911, Promega). Briefly, 1 × 10 4 cells were seeded into 96-well white-bottom plates (Cat. #: 655098, Greiner bioone) and cultivated for 24 h. Cells were washed with PBS and glutathione levels were determined using a GSH-Glo kit according to the manufacturer s protocol. To measure GSH levels in mammary tumors, ' samples were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and tissue was pulverized using a liquid nitrogen-cooled mortar and pestle. Tumor powder was then weighed, and equal amounts were used to determine GSH levels according to the manufacturer s protocol. '

## 2.17. Statistical analysis

Statistical analyses were run using an unpaired Student s t-test with ' Welch s ' correction using Prism-GraphPad software unless otherwise stated. P values were represented using the following annotation: *P ≤ 0.05 and **P ≤ 0.01, ***P ≤ 0.001, ****P ≤ 0.0001.

## 2.18. Circulating tumor cells

For circulating tumor cells (CTCs) studies, 1 × 10 3 4T1-2776 breast cancer cells were injected into the fourth mammary gland of 6- to 8-wkold female Balb/c mice. Mammary tumors were allowed to reach an average volume (1100 mm 3 ) and circulating tumor cells (CTCs) were isolated as previously described [21]. Isolated CTCs were grown in vitro in 10 cm dishes for 1-week post-isolation. Then, CTCs were fixed in formalin for 30 min and stained with crystal violet for 30 min.

## 3. Results

## 3.1. Mammary tumors and breast cancer liver metastases display unique metabolic adaptations

Our previous findings argue that breast cancer cells adopt specific intrinsic metabolic strategies that confer metastatic fitness for specific microenvironments [7,9]. We next explored microenvironment-induced metabolic reprogramming using a syngeneic model of breast cancer liver metastasis derived from 4T1 TNBC cells (4T1-2276 and 4T1-2792) [7,9, 12,22,23]. We first performed laser capture microdissection (LCM) followed by gene expression profiling of 4T1-2276 and 4T1-2792 cells grown as mammary tumors or as liver metastases at 2- and 3-weeks post splenic injection (Fig. 1A).

Global gene expression analysis revealed distinct expression patterns in liver metastases compared to mammary tumors (Fig. 1B). Principal component analysis applied to global gene expression data revealed three distinct groups, with the liver metastases samples (2 and 3 weeks) primarily diverging from primary mammary tumors (Fig. 1C). To identify differentially expressed genes between these groups, commonly upregulated or downregulated genes were identified (Fig. 1D). Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses revealed significant enrichment in signalling pathways linked to cellular metabolism in liver metastases compared to mammary tumors (Fig. 1E). Genes related to glycolysis and gluconeogenesis were most enriched in liver metastases compared to matching 4T1-2776 and 4T1-2792 breast tumors. Indeed, the expression of many genes involved in the glycolytic pathway increased in liver metastases compared to mammary tumors (Supplemental Fig. 1A). These results are in agreement with our previous in vitro findings that liver-metastatic breast cancer cells exhibit a unique metabolic program characterized by the enhanced conversion of glucose-derived pyruvate to lactate via the increased activity of HIF1α and its target pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-1 (PDK1) [7]. We found that HIF1α pathway was also enriched in liver metastases (Fig. 1E) and that the expression of HIF1α regulated genes is enhanced (Supplemental Fig. 1B), confirming our previous results.

KEGG analyses also revealed an enrichment of the glutathione (GSH) metabolism pathway specifically in liver metastases compared to the mammary tumors (Fig. 1E). GSH is a tripeptide (glutamic acid, cysteine, and glycine) that neutralizes oxidative stress which represents a common barrier that metastatic cancers must overcome to form metastases [24 26]. Many genes involved in GSH biosynthesis and metabolism -were elevated in liver metastases compared to mammary tumors (Supplemental Fig. 1C). We validated these results on total RNA isolated from mammary tumors and liver metastases (4T1-2776) and observed a modest increase in the expression of glycolysis and Hif1a pathway genes; however, genes involved in GSH biosynthesis and metabolism were highly increased in liver metastases (Supplemental Fig. 1D). Interestingly, the expression of oxidative stress-regulated genes was also upregulated in liver metastases (Supplemental Fig. 1E), arguing that breast cancer cells growing as liver metastases may experience greater oxidative stress relative to mammary tumors. This includes genes in GSH biosynthesis, such as the catalytic ( Gclc ) and modulatory ( Gclm ) subunits of the glutamate -cysteine ligase complex, and glutathione synthetase ( Gss ), the light-chain subunit of cystine/glutamate antiporter ( Slc7a11/xCT ), and several glutathione s-transferases ( Gstm5 , Gstt1 , Gstt2 , Gsta3 ) that conjugate GSH to a wide variety of endogenous and exogenous compounds (Supplemental Fig. 1F). Immunoblot analysis revealed modest increases in GCLM and GST3 protein levels (Supplemental Fig. 1G). Gene set variation analysis (GSVA) confirmed the enrichment of genes encoding components of the glutathione, glycolysis and HIF-1a pathways (Fig. 1F).

Steady-state metabolic profiling of mammary tumors and liver metastases further confirmed that 4T1-2776 cells maintain their glycolytic nature independently of mammary tumor or metastatic site (Fig. 1G). Trends for increased glycolytic pathway metabolites (Supplemental

Fig. 2A), but not for most citric acid cycle intermediates (Supplemental Fig. 2B), were observed in liver metastases compared to mammary tumors. Interestingly, glutamate levels were also elevated in liver metastases and glutamate is part of the first step in glutathione biosynthesis. Glutamyl-cysteine levels were also significantly increased in liver metastasis, together with GSH and GSSG (Supplemental Fig. 2C) levels, confirming upregulation of the GSH biosynthesis pathway observed by gene expression analysis. Integrated transcriptome and metabolomic analyses revealed increased expression of genes in the glutathione pathway and elevated levels of key GSH metabolites (glutathione, glutamate, cystathionine) in liver metastases compared to mammary tumors (Fig. 1H). In addition, metabolites involved in glycolysis (fructose 6-phosphate, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, pyruvate) and cysteine/methionine metabolism (S-adenosyl-Lhomocysteine) were also elevated in liver metastases. Interestingly, Sadenosyl-L-homocysteine (SAH) can be converted to homocysteine and ultimately, via the transsulfuration pathway, to cysteine that can be used to generate glutamyl-cysteine, the first step in the glutathione biosynthesis. Elevated GSH levels observed in liver metastases relative to mammarytumors is further supported by the observation that NAD(P)H: NAD(P) ratios tend to be decreased in liver metastases (Supplemental Fig. 2D). Indeed, NADPH is required for the reduction of GSSG to GSH through the activity of glutathione reductase (GSR), replenishing the pool of reduced glutathione that is available to neutralize ROS. Taken together, these data indicate that liver-metastatic breast cancer cells not only retain several intrinsic metabolic strategies, such as a glycolytic and pseudo-hypoxic state, but also acquire novel metabolic adaptations induced by the metastatic microenvironment, such as the upregulation of the glutathione metabolism pathway.

## 3.2. Breast cancer liver metastases display similar global glucose and glutamine utilization relative to mammary tumors

To gain additional insights into the metabolic programs engaged in mammary tumors and liver metastases, we performed in vivo stable isotope tracer analysis (SITA) of [U -13 C6]-glucose (Fig. 2A). Liver metastases were obtained by direct injection of 4T1-2776 cells into the liver (intrahepatic injection), which generates well-defined tumor lesions that can be easily dissected from the surrounding parenchyma. Tracing of glucose-derived carbons revealed that both mammary tumors and liver metastases take up and route glucose into the glycolytic pathway, as shown by similar levels of pyruvate m + 3 and lactate m + 3 (Fig. 2B). Similarly, mammary tumors and liver metastases replenish their pool of citric acid cycle intermediates via pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) (citrate, ⍺ -KG, succinate, fumarate, malate m + 2) in a comparable way (Fig. 2C). Analysis of anaplerotic pyruvate metabolism (citrate, malate, and fumarate m + 3), which is fostered by pyruvate carboxylase (PC) and/or malic enzymes (Me1/2) (Fig. 2A), did not reveal any substantial differences between liver metastases and mammary tumors (Fig. 2D). Taken together these results indicate that 4T1-2776 cells use glucose in a similar way both when growing as mammary tumors or liver metastases, confirming their highly glycolytic nature.

Wenext assessed how mammary tumors and liver metastases utilized glutamine (Fig. 2E). SITA using [U -13 C5]-glutamine revealed a similar flow of glutamine into citric acid cycle intermediates (succinate, malate, fumarate, citrate m + 4) (Fig. 2F) in both mammary tumors and liver metastases. In accordance with the depletion of NADPH levels previously observed in liver metastases (Supplemental Fig. 2D), which may result from reductive carboxylation of glutamine initiated by the NADPH-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenases (IDH1/2), we observed statistically significant increases in aspartate, malate, and fumarate m 3 (Fig. 2G). In aggregate, the infusion results argue that mammary + tumors and liver metastases from 4T1-2776 cells comparably use glucose and glutamine to fuel glycolysis and mitochondrial metabolism.

3.3. Glutathione biosynthesis is increased in breast cancer liver metastases compared to mammary tumors

Transcriptomics and metabolomics analyses suggested that GSH biosynthesis is elevated in breast cancer liver metastases (Fig. 1). Thus, we investigated whether 4T1-2776 breast cancer cells utilize glucose for glutathione synthesis (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, labelling of glucosederived carbons into GSH (m + 2) and GSSG (m + 2 and m 4) was + significantly increased in liver metastases compared to mammary tumors (Fig. 3B). GSH m + 2 could also result from glycine m + 2 labelling derived from glycolysis and the serine biosynthetic pathway (Fig. 3A) We detected a trend towards lower labeling of glycine m + 2 in liver metastases compared to mammary tumors, suggesting m + 2 glucosederived glycine derived from serine biosynthesis might be used for incorporation into GSH to a greater degree in liver metastasis (Fig. 3C).

Similarly, we assessed the contribution of glutamine-derived carbons for GSH biosynthesis (Fig. 3D). SITA using [U -13 C5]-glutamine revealed an increase of glutamate m + 5 labelling in liver metastases compared to mammary tumors, supporting increased processing of [U -13 C5]-glutamine (Fig. 3E). SITA analysis also revealed significantly increased labelling into GSH m + 5 and GSSG m + 5 in liver metastases as compared to mammary tumors. We evaluated steady-state GSH levels in 5 additional primary tumors and 5 liver metastases using a GSH-Glo glutathione assay, which confirmed enhanced glutathione levels in liver metastases (Fig. 3F). Taken together, these tracing experiments suggest that 4T1-2776 cells growing in the liver favour the use of glucose and glutamine carbons for de novo production of glutathione.

## 3.4. GCLC is required for the efficient growth of liver metastases

We next investigated whether the observed glutathione increase is functionally important for the growth of liver metastases. When compared to mammary tumors, metastatic lesions from 4T1-2776 breast cancer cells exhibited decreased staining of 8-oxo-2 -deoxyguanosine (8-' oxo-dG), a product of ROS-mediated DNA oxidation (Fig. 4A and B). Decreased 8-oxo-dG levels indicate that liver metastases are better able to neutralize ROS compared to mammary tumors. To test the requirement for GSH biogenesis on the growth of mammary tumors or the formation of liver metastases, we treated cohorts of mice with buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), an inhibitor of GCL (Fig. 4C). While BSO treatment did not affect the growth of 4T1-2776 cells as mammary tumors (Supplemental Fig. 3A), we observed only modest and statistically insignificant decreases in the liver-metastatic burden (Supplemental Figs. 3B and C). Although BSO efficiently reduced glutathione levels in 4T1-2776 cells cultivated in vitro (data not shown), we could not directly assess the impact of BSO treatment on GSH levels in vivo as liver metastases were generated via splenic injection, which does not permit the clean isolation of the metastatic tissue from the surrounding liver parenchyma. Nevertheless, the lack of a significant effect of BSO treatment on mammary tumor growth or the formation of liver metastases could be explained by either poor biodistribution and/or activity of BSO in vivo [27] or by the upregulation of compensatory antioxidant mechanisms, such as the thioredoxin (TRDX) as previously described [28].

To achieve a more stable depletion of glutathione levels, we decided to knockout Gclc , the catalytic subunit of the glutamate-cysteine ligase, which is responsible for the condensation of glutamate and cysteine (Fig. 4C). Upon selection, we identified three 4T1-2776 Gclc KO clones with lower levels of GCLC expression (Fig. 4D). The incomplete loss of Gclc might be due to the semi-random nature of DNA double-strand break resolution by alternative nonhomologous end-joining mechanisms, which induce insertions and deletions at the CRISPR target site resulting in frameshift or retaining the reading frame of the gene, thus leading to silent mutations that leave a functional copy of the gene. Although we could not achieve a full knockout of Gclc , clone #4 and clone # 10 showed a 50 % reduction in GSH levels (Fig. 4E), which was maintained during routine passaging. We first compared the growth of 4T1-

2776 Gclc KO clones #4 and #10 to parental 4T1-2776 cells when injected into the mammary fat pad, which revealed a very modest impact on primary tumour growth (Fig. 4F). However, GSH depletion had a profound effect in blocking the development of liver metastases (Fig. 4G and H). To assess the impact of Gclc knockdown on GSH levels in vivo , we generated liver metastases from 4T1-2776 GclcKO CL#4, CL#10 and parental cells by intrahepatic injections. The genetic depletion of Gclc led to an in vivo decrease of 34 % for CL#4 and 38 % for CL#10 in GSH levels (Fig. 4 I).

Loss of GCLC induced higher levels of 8-Oxo-dG staining suggesting that liver metastases have decreased capacity to buffer oxidative stress in the absence of GCLC (Fig. 4J and K). Taken together, these data suggest that glutathione plays a key role in the formation of breast cancer liver metastases cells by alleviating oxidative stress.

## 3.5. Disseminating breast cancer cells require GCLC to survive in circulation and establish distal metastases

To establish distal metastases, breast cancer cells must leave their primary site, intravasate into the bloodstream, survive, extravasate and proliferate at secondary sites [29]. Both the loss of cell-cell adhesion and cell growth in suspension are processes that generate oxidative stress, which must be neutralized for cancer cells to efficiently metastasize. The use of splenic injections as a model of experimental liver metastasis involves a brief period where cancer cells circulate in the bloodstream. Considering these observations, we investigated whether GCLC activity is required for the early steps of the metastatic cascade, prior to seeding the liver.

We thus investigated whether GCLC-deficient 4T1-2776 cells might be impaired for intravasation and/or survival in circulation. Thus, we injected 4T1-2776 Gclc KO clones #4 and #10 in the mammary fat pad of mice, along with parental control cells. All tumors were allowed to reach an average size of 1300 mm , at which time whole blood was collected, 3 viable circulating tumor cells (CTCs) were harvested, and the number of CTC-derived adherent colonies was quantified after 1 week of in vitro culture. Mice bearing breast tumors from 4T1-2776 parental cells produced a higher number of CTCs (Fig. 5A) compared to those bearing tumors from 4T1-2776 Gclc KO clones #4 and #10 cells (Fig. 5B). Given the clear negative impact of GCLC loss on the number of circulating CTCs, we assessed whether the formation of distal metastases was also impaired following reduction of GCLC expression. Indeed, loss of GCLC resulted in reduced spontaneous metastasis to the lungs (Fig. 5C and D).

To further investigate whether breast cancer cells require glutathione pools to survive in circulation and seed metastases to distal sites, we injected 4T1-2776 GclcKO directly into the tail vein along with GCLCexpressing breast cancer cells. Loss of GCLC resulted in significantly reduced lung metastasis, suggesting that maintenance of glutathione levels plays an important role in the ability of cancer cells to transit in circulation and colonize distal sites (Fig. 5E and F).

Taken together these data indicate that GCLC, and thus maintenance

of glutathione levels, plays an important role in the ability of cancer cells to survive detachment from underlying substrates and transit in circulation. These data suggest that GCLC is required to buffer oxidative stress encountered by tumor cells during various stages of metastasis.

3.6. GCLC promotes metastasis of human breast cancer cells to multiple sites

We next determined the impact of GCLC loss in an independent model of metastatic human breast cancer cells. To do so, we employed MDA-MB-231 triple-negative breast cancer cells that spontaneously metastasize to both the lungs and the liver. We attempted to generate loss of Gclc by both CRISPR/Cas9 knockout or short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated depletion approaches; however, we were only successful in generating stable knockdown clones in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells (Fig. 6A and B). Upon selection, we identified two shRNAs that reduced Gclc mRNA expression (Fig. 6A) and for each shRNA, we identified clones with lower levels of GCLC protein expression. GCLC protein levels were reduced to 53 % in MDA-MB-231 shGclc4 cells (clone #4) and 78 % in MDA-MB-231 shGclc5 cells (clone #6) (Fig. 6B), which resulted in a 35 % or 26 % decrease in GSH levels for clone #4 and 26 % for clone #6, respectively (Fig. 6C).

Wethen assessed the impact of GCLC loss on the metastatic potential of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells in vivo using a spontaneous metastasis assay. Cells were injected into the mammary fat pads of mice, breast tumors were allowed to reach a set volume (500 -600 mm 3 ) prior to resection, and mice were monitored for the development of distal metastases. As previously observed for 4T1-2776 Gclc KO cells (Fig. 4), reduced GCLC levels did not greatly hamper the growth of primary tumors, although a modest delay in tumor growth was observed for clone #4 (Fig. 6D). However, GSH depletion impaired the development of liver metastases in both clone #4 and clone #6 (Fig. 6E and F). Reduced GCLCexpression also impaired the formation of lung metastases (Fig. 6G and H). The slightly reduced impact of reduced GCLC levels on spontaneous metastasis (lung and liver) observed for clone #4 may be confounded by the fact that these tumors took longer to reach resectable tumor volumes, which may have led to more cancer cells being shed into circulation. However, this is not an issue for the anti-metastatic phenotypes shown with clone 6. Together, these results confirm our previous finding that GCLC is required for breast cancer cells to survive in circulation and seed metastasis to distal sites such as the liver and the lungs.

## 4. Discussion

Different organs present unique metabolic challenges for disseminated cancer cells, requiring profound metabolic changes in tumor cells that successfully colonize secondary sites [3,4,30 -33]. Here we have investigated how liver-tropic breast cancer cells modify their metabolism in response to different microenvironments, identifying

glutathione biosynthesis and metabolism as a key mediator of breast cancer metastasis.

Disseminating breast tumor cells that seed the liver encounter a profoundly different environment when compared to the mammary gland from which they originated. In the liver, the blood flow along the hepatic lobule radial axis generates ' zones ' that are characterized by

gradients of oxygen, nutrients and hormones, which gives rise to a highly variable microenvironment [34]. Cancer cells that colonize poorly perfused regions may need to engage adaptive responses to cope with zones of hypoxia. When compared to parental 4T1 breast cancer cells, we previously found that liver-metastatic 4T1-2776 and 4T1-2792 derivative populations rely on glycolysis as their main metabolic

strategy by activating HIF1-⍺ and its target PDK1, which regulates glucose oxidation by preventing the entry of pyruvate into the TCA cycle [7]. In the present study, we found that liver-tropic cells retain their glycolytic phenotype independently of the anatomical location in which they grow (mammary tumors versus liver metastases). Genes regulating glycolysis and gluconeogenesis are expressed both in primary mammary tumors and in liver metastases, although at higher levels in the latter. Tracing experiments in vivo revealed that labelled glucose flows through glycolysis and into the TCA cycle similarly in mammary tumors and in liver metastasis. Together, these data support a model in which breast cancer cells that colonize the liver experience an environment characterized by low oxygen and increased competition for nutrients and glucose, to which they respond by activating HIF1-⍺ -mediated adaptive responses that favour a PDK1-driven glycolytic phenotype. Interestingly, such metabolic rewiring is maintained when liver-tropic cells are transplanted into a different microenvironment, such as the mouse mammary fat pad.

4T1-2776 and 4T1-2792 cells undergo further metabolic changes in response to microenvironmental cues to maintain metastatic fitness. Disseminating tumor cells that arrive in the liver face a highly prooxidant microenvironment caused by hepatic hypoxia, which triggers ROS generation [34 36]. While increased ROS production associated -with the initial steps of oncogenic transformation may contribute to the establishment of the transformed phenotype, the higher levels of ROS experienced by cancer cells at the various steps during cancer dissemination must be efficiently neutralized so that tumor cells may successfully complete the metastatic cascade [37]. Our data show that liver-aggressive cells growing in the hepatic environment acquire the capacity to enhance de novo glutathione biosynthesis. Genes encoding enzymes involved in glutathione biosynthesis ( Gclc, Gclm, Gss, Slc7a11/xCT ) and metabolism ( Gstm5 , Gstt1 , Gstt2 , Gsta3 ) were significantly upregulated in liver metastasis compared to mammary tumors. Glutathione protects cells from a wider variety of free radicals including ROS, lipid hydroperoxides, xenobiotics and heavy metals. We found that liver metastases have a higher capacity to buffer oxidative damage compared to mammary tumors as shown by lower levels of 8-Oxo-dG, one of the major indicators of DNA oxidation. Our study shows that liver-aggressive breast cancer cells rely on GCLC, and GSH synthesis, for successful liver metastasis. Reduced GCLC expression impaired the ability of 4T1-2776 cells to grow as liver metastasis. Cells depleted of GCLC have lower levels of glutathione and increased ROS-induced DNA damage, as assessed by increased 8-Oxo-dG, suggesting GCLC loss impairs their ability to efficiently neutralize ROS.

Our data are consistent with previous reports indicating that the formation of liver metastases by colorectal cancer cells relies on glutathione-mediated scavenging to alleviate oxidative stress [38 -40]. Interestingly, GSH is also required for metastasis to diverse organs, including the formation of colorectal cancer lung metastases [39], HER2 + breast cancer brain metastases [41], and melanoma metastasis to multiple visceral sites [25]. Our results show that GCLC and GSH are

required for the establishment breast cancer metastasis to the liver and to the lungs. These observations indicate that metabolic adaptations resulting in increased antioxidant capacities are common to different metastatic microenvironments.

In our model, GCLC and GSH levels can contribute to the growth of liver-aggressive cells in the mammary fat pad, although the effect of GCLC deletion on the growth of mammary tumors was much less profound than the impact observed on liver metastasis. These results are in agreement with previous observations that GCLM, the modulatory subunit of the glutamate-cysteine ligase, and thus GSH biosynthesis, is required for cancer initiation in the MMTV-PyMT murine model of breast cancer [28].

Our data indicate that the requirement for breast cancer cells to effectively scavenge ROS is critical for their metastatic ability. Indeed, it was previously shown that GSH-depleted breast cancer cells and resulting mammary tumors upregulate the thioredoxin (TXN) antioxidant pathway, which can reduce ROS levels in a GSH-independent manner [28]. These observations highlight the incredible selective pressure breast cancer cells experience to maintain robust ROS scavenging systems for efficient metastasis.

An intriguing question that arises from our study is at which step of the metastatic cascade do breast cancer cells upregulate the glutathione pathway? Our data indicate that enhanced glutathione biosynthesis is required for cancer cells to traverse multiple steps of the metastatic cascade. Analysis of metastatic lesions obtained by intrahepatic injections, in which cancer cells are directly delivered into the liver, indicate that the liver microenvironment can specifically induce de novo glutathione synthesis in metastasizing cancer cells. Glutathione pools are also necessary to establish liver metastases following splenic injection, where cancer cells must travel through the portal vein to reach the liver. Survival in circulation is a key element for the spread of CTCs, which must cope with a combination of physical stress, oxidative stress, anoikis, and limited availability of growth factors and cytokines. In the context of melanoma, it was shown that circulating tumor cells that successfully establish metastasis have high levels of nicotinamide adenine nucleotide phosphate (NADPH), which is important for regenerating GSH pools [25]. Similarly, metastasizing breast cancer cells present higher levels of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD + ) kinase (NADK), thus leading to the expansion of NADPH pools, reflecting the need for circulating cancer cells to fuel the metabolic and redox demands of the metastatic cascade and enable successful colonization of distal organs [42]. Our data argue that the requirement for robust ROS-buffering systems may emerge at early stages of the metastatic process, when cancer cells leave the primary tumor and enter the circulation. GCLC depletion in breast cancer cells growing in the mammary fat pad reduces the number of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and decreases the burden of cells spontaneously metastasizing to the lungs. Loss of GCLC resulted in significantly reduced lung metastasis following tail vein injection, confirming that maintenance of glutathione levels plays a key role in the ability of cancer cells to transit in circulation and

colonize distal sites. Thus, our data suggest that breast cancer cells can already develop metabolic profiles necessary to effectively scavenge ROS at the beginning of the metastatic cascade and maintain/reinforce such adaptations in response to microenvironmental stimuli at the site of secondary colonization, such as the liver and the lung. Indeed, it has been shown that breast cancer cells that detaching from the extracellular matrix must engage anti-oxidant mechanisms to survive anoikis [24, 43 45]. -

Our study has identified de novo GSH biosynthesis as an important metabolic adaptation acquired by disseminating breast cancer cells. This glutathione dependency could be regarded as a vulnerability point that may be exploited by oxidative-stress-inducing drugs. To date, several clinical efforts have unsuccessfully attempted to pharmacologically target glutathione pools in cancer cells without success [46]. The clinical development of buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), which depletes GSH levels by inhibiting its synthesis, has been discontinued due to its short half-life and inability to significantly reduce GSH levels in human tumors [27]. Moreover, treatment of tumors with BSO as a single agent was shown to trigger compensatory antioxidant pathways, including the thioredoxins [28]. Combination strategies coupling BSO with thioredoxin inhibitors (sulfasalazine or auranofin), have shown efficacy in reducing breast cancer growth in mouse models of breast cancer [28].

An alternative approach to decrease GSH levels is to reduce the availability of amino acid precursors. Drugs such as sulfasalazine or erastin inhibit the cystine/glutamate antiporter SLC7A11/xCT, which leads to cysteine deprivation, glutathione depletion and cell death by ferroptosis [47]. However, the poor water solubility and metabolic stability of erastin has limited its application in vivo [48]. GSH precursors can also be generated by tumor cells following uptake of circulating glutathione and its degradation by gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT). Unfortunately, several GGT inhibitors (acivicin and 6-diazo-5-oxol-norleucine) have shown considerable toxicity, which prevents their clinical use [49].

Taken together, considerable interest exists in the therapeutic targeting of GSH metabolism in oncology. The nonselective nature of thioldepleting agents, including BSO, is a serious barrier for GSH depletion strategies since they can affect non-malignant tissues. Moreover, the development of mechanisms driving resistance to GSH depletion, and the activation of alternative antioxidant pathways mediated by TRX and NRF2 systems, pose a big challenge for pharmacological efficacy. To date, the most promising targets for the modulation of GSH from an anticancer perspective are GCLC and SLC7A11/xCT. The future development of novel agents that modulate glutathione may come from further identification of novel pathways regulating GSH biosynthesis and metabolism. Such therapeutics may be effective in better managing patients that have developed metastases in tissues that require robust engagement of ROS detoxification programs, such as the liver.
