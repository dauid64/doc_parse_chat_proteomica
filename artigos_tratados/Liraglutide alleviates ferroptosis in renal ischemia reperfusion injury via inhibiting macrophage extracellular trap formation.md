Background and purpose: Renal transplantation and other conditions with transiently reduced blood flow is major cause of renal ischemia/reperfusion injury (RIRI), a therapeutic challenge clinically. This study investigated the role of liraglutide in ferroptosis-associated RIRI via macrophage extracellular traps (METs).

Methods: Animal model with RIRI was established in C57BL/6J mice. A total of 72 C57BL/6J mice were used with 8 mice per group. Primary tubular epithelium was co-culture with RAW264.7 under hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R)  condition  to  mimic  in  vitro.  Liraglutide  was  administrated  into  mice  and  cells.  Extracellular  DNA, neutrophil elastase and myeloperoxidase in serum and supernatant of cell medium were collected for measuring METs. F4/80 and citH3 were labeled to show METs.

Results: Liraglutide relieved RIRI and ferroptosis in vivo, and inhibited renal I/R-induced METs both in vivo and in vitro. F4/80 and citrullinated histone H3 (citH3) were highly co-localized after RIRI. Liraglutide attenuated the co-localization of citH3 and F4/80. Expressions of M2 markers were enhanced whereas these of M1 markers suppressed  during  liraglutide  treatment  in  RIRI.  Phosphorylation  of  signal  transducer  and  activator  of  transcription  (STAT)1,  3  and  6  were  increased  in  RIRI  mice  and  H/R-induced  RAW264.7.  However,  liraglutide decreased phosphorylation of STAT1 and increased phosphorylation of STAT3 and STAT6. STAT3/6 inhibition reversed liraglutide-inhibited M1 polarization, extracellular traps and ferroptosis.

Conclusion: Liraglutide inhibited ferroptosis-induced renal dysfunction since it skewed macrophage polarization into M2 phenotype that interfered the formation of extracellular traps based on STAT3/6 pathway during RIRI. Liraglutide was proposed to be used for RIRI clinical treatment.

## 1. Introduction

Ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) characterized by swelling, necrosis and nonuniform  revascularization  is  an  inevitable  event  of  renal  transplantation [1,2]. Renal ischemia reperfusion injury (RIRI) progression is accompanied with oxidative damage and immune response in addition to alterations in key signal pathways such as Toll-like receptor (TLR) pathway [3]. RIRI contributes to the occurrence and development of acute kidney injury, limitation to graft function and immune rejection in recipient  [4].  Interstitial  fibrosis  and  tubular  atrophy  in  renal  tissue

were stimulated by RIRI in histopathology [5]. According to statistics, RIRI is responsible for up to 50 -70 % of deaths in intensive care units; in addition, RIRI poses severe economic burden on society, for example, it causes 10 billion dollars in annual care costs in the US and 400 600 million  pounds  in  the  UK  [6].  Thus,  RIRI  has  considered  a -worldwide problem. The molecular pathophysiology of RIRI provides novel  targets  for  clinical  therapy,  thereby  promoting  the  advance  in long-term strategies of disease interventions.

Ferroptosis, a novel form of necrosis, is executed by reactive oxygen species, overloaded iron and lipid peroxidation, which contributes to the

occurrence  and  development  of  RIRI  [7,8].  Proximal  renal  tubular epithelial cells are highly sensitive to I/R condition, of which survival depend on expressions of ferroptosis-related proteins [9,10]. Ferroptosis inhibitors have been determined as the potential therapeutic drugs to alleviate  tubular  cell  death  and  renal  dysfunction.  He  et  al.  [11] concluded that ferrostatin-1, a ferroptosis inhibitor, significantly protected against renal tubular epithelial cell death by downregulating of ferroptosis-related  proteins,  iron  and  lipid  peroxidation.  Besides,  a report  by  Li  et  al.  [12] found  ferrostatin-1  treatment  could  mitigate ferroptosis-induced mitochondrial damage, oxidative stress and inflammation in proximal renal tubular cells, thereby improving renal lesions  in  the  pathological  level.  Thus,  insight  in  ferroptosis-related mechanism plays the crucial role in the therapeutic strategy of RIRI.

Macrophage  can  suppress  RIRI  progression  via  anti-inflammatory phenotype  [13].  Importantly,  macrophage  affects  the  cellular  sensitivity to  ferroptosis,  thereby  contributing  to  ferroptosis-associated ischemia  diseases  [14].  Beside  inflammatory  or  anti-inflammatory phenotype, macrophage can form extracellular traps containing extracellular DNA fibers and granule proteins to capture and kill the pathogen [15]. Macrophage extracellular traps (METs) are the core structure of macrophage in modulating inflammation and related cellular mechanism.  The  latest  evidence  suggested  that  the  enhancement  of  METs aggravated ferroptosis-induced parenchymal cell death under hypoxia/ reoxygenation (H/R) condition, indicating METs functions as the significant  regulator  of  ferroptosis-associated  ischemia  diseases  [16]. Heretofore, whether the formation of METs is involved in RIRI has not yet been definitively revealed. Intriguingly, the formation of METs has been suggested to be a critical mediator of acute renal injury, and it has been proposed to be an important mechanism for inducing acute kidney injury [17,18]. As we know, I/R condition is an key cause of acute renal injury [19]. Thus, this work will explore whether METs is over-formed in RIRI.

Liraglutide, an agonist of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R), is  expressed in gastrointestinal tract, kidneys, heart, brain, lungs and pancreas [20]. Liraglutide has been determined to ameliorate RIRI. Li et al. [21] reported that liraglutide prevent renal tissue in mice from I/R condition via the GLP-1R-dependent translocation and release of nuclear high-mobility  group  box  1  to  cytoplasm.  However,  the  therapeutic mechanism of liraglutide remains unclear. On the one hand, liraglutide modulates the expression and activation of signal pathways in inflammatory macrophage [22]. On the other hand, liraglutide can inhibit lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress beside changes in ferroptosis-related proteins, which repress ferroptosis process in liver and brain [23,24]. Potentially, liraglutide may  contribute  to  inhibiting macrophageinvolved ferroptosis in RIRI progression.

To investigate the role of liraglutide in ferroptosis-associated RIRI via  METs, we plan to co-incubate RAW264.7 cell with renal tubular epithelial cell under H/R condition and establish the mouse model with RIRI.  In  the  present  study,  we  provide  the  evidence  that  liraglutide regulates M1/M2 polarization to inhibit METs involved in ferroptosismediated RIRI progression. Importantly, we also determine that signal transducer  and  activator  of  transcription  (STAT)3/6  pathway  may mediate M2 phenotype in macrophage under liraglutide treatment for RIRI.

## 2. Methods

## 2.1. Animal model

C57BL/6J mature male mice (8-week old, weighing 22 -28 g) were acquired from Vital River Laboratory Animal Technology (Beijing) Co., Ltd.  (Beijing,  China).  All  animal  experiments  were  approved  by  the Animal Ethics Committee of Capital Medical University.

Mice were anaesthetized by 2 % isoflurane and then routinely skin sterilized.  Then  the  construction  of  renal  I/R  mouse  model  was  performed by unilaterally clamping the left renal artery for 45 min. At the

same time,  the  contralateral  kidney  of  each  mouse  was  removed  by contralateral nephrectomy. In some experiments, animals were treated with  liraglutide  (HY-P0014,  MedChemExpress,  purity ≥ 99.68  %)  at doses of 200 or 400 μ g/kg/12 h for 6 times, and the final treatment of liraglutide was carried out 12 h after the model of renal I/R. Some animals  received  stattic  (10  mg/kg  for  3  times  one  week  before  RIRI) (STAT3 inhibitor, HY-13818, MedChemExpress, purity ≥ 98.0  %)  or AS1517499 (10 mg/kg intraperitoneal 1 h before I/R) (STAT6 inhibitor, HY-100614, MedChemExpress, purity ≥ 98.53 %) treatment. Mice were processed by euthanasia using excessive anesthesia 24 h after modeling. The procedure of euthanasia was as follows [25]: Mice were subjected to the deep anesthetized through inhalation of 5 % isoflurane. Mice were executed by rapid cervical dislocation when they had no response to head and limb stimulation. The whole renal of each mouse was harvested quickly.

In total, 72 mice were used in this study, and each group included 8 mice. In detail, in the study of the therapeutic effect of liraglutide on RIRI, 4 groups of mice were used, and the treatment of mice in the 4 groups was as follows: Sham group (n = 8): Mice were subjected to the similar surgery of RIRI, but without unilateral clamping of the left renal artery. I/R group (n = 8): Mice underwent RIRI surgery, but without any other treatment. I/R + liraglutide 200 group (n = 8): Mice were subjected to RIRI surgery, and liraglutide treatment at a dose of 200 μ g/kg/ 12 h for 6 times. The final treatment was performed 12 h after RIRI. I/R + liraglutide 400 group (n = 8): Mice were treated similarly to I/R + liraglutide 200 group, but the dose of liraglutide used was 400 g/kg/12 h.

Additionally,  in  the  research  of  the  mechanism  of  liraglutide  on treating RIRI, 5 groups of mice were included and they were treated as follows: Sham group (n = 8): The treatment of mice was as described above. I/R group (n = 8): Mice were treated as described above. I/R + liraglutide  group  (n = 8):  Mice  experienced  RIRI  surgery,  and  then treated by liraglutide (at a dose of 400 μ g/kg/12 h for 6 times). The final treatment was performed 12 h after RIRI. I/R + liraglutide + Stattic group (n = 8): One week prior to RIRI surgery, mice were received stattic treatment (10 mg/kg for 3 times, via intraperitoneal injection), and then experienced RIRI surgery and liraglutide treatment (at a dose of 400 μ g/ kg/12 h for 6 times). The final treatment was performed 12 h after RIRI. I/R + liraglutide + AS15174998 group (n = 8): One hour prior to RIRI surgery, mice were given AS1517499 treatment (10 mg/kg, via intraperitoneal injection). Afterwards, RIRI surgery and liraglutide treatment (at a dose of 400 μ g/kg/12 h for 6 times) were implemented. The final liraglutide treatment was performed 12 h after RIRI.

## 2.2. Cell culture and treatment

Primary renal tubular epithelial cells were isolated from C57BL/6J mice as previously described [26]. Primary renal tubular epithelial cells were culture with 10 % fetal bovine serum (FBS)-containing RPMI medium with 1 % penicillin -streptomycin (Gibco, USA) at 37 ℃ in 5 % CO2, whereas  RAW264.7  cells  purchased  from  American  Type  Culture Collection (ATCC, USA) were incubated in 10 % FBS-containing Dulbecco s Modified Eagle s Medium (DMEM, Gibco, USA) with 1 % pen-' ' icillin -streptomycin. Co-culture between RAW264.7 and primary renal tubular epithelial cell was performed. Primary renal tubular epithelial cells  were  seeded  in  the  lower  compartment  of  6-well  transwell  and RAW264.7 in transwell insert. After a 24-h culture, RAW264.7 in insert were  transferred to lower  compartment  for  the  co-culture.  H/R modeling  was  performed  as  follows:  cells  were  cultured  in  a  9-h  of hypoxia condition with 5 % CO2, 94 % N2 and 1 % O2, and then incubated with a 2-h of reoxygenation environment (5 % CO2 and 95 % air). Liraglutide (200 nM [27]) treatment and Cl-amidine (inhibitor of METs [10 μ M, No. S8141, purity ≥ 97.59 %, Sellckchem, USA]) treatments were carried out, respectively. Specifically, liraglutide (200 nM) and Clamidine (10 μ M) treatments were started 30 min before modeling, and continued  for  12h  treatment  after  modeling.  Fer-1,  an  inhibitor  of

ferroptosis, was used for the positive control of liraglutide to demonstrate the role of liraglutide in ferroptosis. H/R-stimulated renal tubular epithelial cells co-cultured with RAW264.7 were incubated with fer-1 (HY-100579, MedChemExpree, USA) at the dose of 1 μ M for 12h. In this study, primary renal tubular epithelial cells were co-cultured with RAW264.7 cells to mimic the renal environment, and liraglutide treatment was for the study of liraglutide effect on cells.

## 2.3. H &amp; E staining for renal injury

Renal sections (a thickness of 4 μ m) were prepared and stained by Hematoxylin &amp; Eosin Staining Kit (Abcam, USA, Hematoxylin for 5 min, Eosin for 3 min) after dewaxing and hydration. The tubular injury was evaluated  based  on  tubular  necrosis,  cast  formation,  loss  of  brush border, tubular dilation, as well as tubular degeneration.

The score of tubular injury was evaluated by the following criteria [28]: 0 point, normal; 1 point, injury area was less than 25 % of the section; 2 points, injury area was between 25 % and 50 % of the section; 3 points, injury area was between 50 % and 75 % of the section; 4 points, injury area was more than 75 % of the section.

## 2.4. Measure of BUN and Scr

Blood samples of mice were collected 24 h after modeling. Blood of each mouse was obtained by eyeball, and a total of 800 μ L blood was collected from each mouse. After routinely centrifuged, serum samples were gathered. Levels of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine (Scr) were measured using AU480 (Beckman Coulter, Bria, California, USA).

## 2.5. Western blotting

Radio-immunoprecipitation Assay (RIPA) lysis was used to isolate total protein from homogenate tissue and cell suspension. Total protein concentration was determined using BCA protein kit (P0011, Beyotime, Shanghai,  China).  Total  protein  (50 μ g  per  lane)  was  separated  by electrophoresis of sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel, and then transferred  from  gel  onto  the  polyvinylidene  fluoride  membrane. Membranes were blocked in 5 % skimmed milk for 90 min at room temperature.  After  that,  membranes  were  incubated  with  anti-GPX4 (ab125066,  1:10000,  Abcam,  USA),  ACSL4  (ab155282,  1:10000, Abcam, USA), ATF3 (ab254268, 1:1000, Abcam, USA), citH3 (NB10057135,  1:10000,  Novus  Biologicals,  USA),  MPO  (ab208670,  1:1000, Abcam, USA), NE (ab68672, 1 μ g/mL, Abcam, USA), CD86 (ab112490, 1 μ g/mL, Abcam, USA), iNOS (ab178945, 1:1000, Abcam, USA), Arg-1 (ab239731,  0.5 μ g/mL,  Abcam,  USA),  IL-10  (ab189392,  1:1000, Abcam,  USA),  cleaved  caspase  3  (ab214430,  1:5000,  Abcam,  USA), cleaved caspase 1 (#4199, Cell signaling, USA), p-MLKL (ab196436, 1:1000,  Abcam,  USA),  MLKL  (ab243142,  1:2000,  Abcam,  USA)  and GAPDH (ab8245, 1:10000, Abcam, USA) at 4 ℃ overnight, followed by the culture with secondary antibody (ab6721, 1:10000, Abcam, USA) for 30 min at room temperature [29]. The protein blots were visualized by enhanced  chemiluminescent  reagent  (Beyotime,  Shanghai,  China) treatment, and then qualified by Image J software (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA). Normalization was performed on the expression data of proteins, and GAPDH was adopted as control.

## 2.6. qPCR

Total RNA was extracted from homogenate tissue and cell suspension using Trizol regent (1 mL), respectively. NanoPhotometer N60 (IMPLEN, Germany) was utilized in the detection of RNA concentration. A total of 2 μ g RNA was reversely transcribed to cDNA by QuantiNova Reverse Transcription Kit (QIAGEN, Germany). Then, the quantification was carried out using SYBR Green PCR amplification reagent (QIAGEN, Germany) and QuantStudio 3 Real-Time PCR System (Applied

Biosystems, USA). GAPDH was utilized in the internal control of gene. Expressions of GPX4, ATF3, ACSL4, CD86, iNOS, Arg-1 and IL-10 were quantified by the 2 GLYPH&lt;0&gt; △△ CT method with GAPDH as the control [30]. △△ CT was defined as (CT [target gene, sample to be tested] -CT [control gene, sample to be tested]) GLYPH&lt;0&gt; (CT [target gene, control sample] -CT [control gene, control sample]) [31].

The primers of these genes were shown as following:

## 2.7. Quantification of METs

Blood samples of mice and cell media were collected and centrifuged to harvest  serum  and  supernatant  samples.  Extracellular  doublestranded DNA (dsDNA), neutrophil elastase (NE) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) in serum samples and supernatant of cell media were collected to quantify METs. Quant-iT ™ PicoGreen ™ dsDNA Assay Kits and dsDNA Reagents (Thermo Fisher, USA), Mouse MPO ELISA Kit (Thermo Fisher, USA) and Mouse NE ELISA Kit (Abcam, USA) were utilized in measure. To qualify the levels of dsDNA, NE and MPO, the absorbance value of each sample was read under a Synergy HTX Multi-Mode Reader (BioTek, Winooski, VT, USA) at a wavelength of 405 nm.

## 2.8. Measure of IL-10, malondialdehyde, glutathione and iron

Malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH) and iron in homogenate tissue and cell suspension was measured using IL-10 ELISA kit (E-ELM0046c for mice experiment; E-EL-H6154 for cell experiments; Elabscience, Wuhan, China), Lipid Peroxidation MDA Assay Kit (Beyotime, Shanghai, China), GSH Assay Kit (Beyotime, Shanghai, China) and Iron Colorimetric Assay Kit (Applygen, Beijing, China), respectively.

## 2.9. Immunohistochemistry for CD86 and CD206

Sections (4μ m-thickness) with dewaxing and hydration were heated in 1 × citrate solution (pH = 6.0, Cell Signaling, USA) for a quarter at 100 ℃ and stood at room temperature for 20 -30 min, followed by reaction with 3 % H2O2 for 5 min and the subsequent incubation with 5 % bovine serum albumin for 1 h. Then, sections were cultured with antiCD86 (#19589, 1:400, Cell Signaling, USA) and anti-CD206 (#24595, 1:400, Cell Signaling, USA) at 4 ℃ overnight, followed by the incubation with secondary antibody for 30 min at room temperature. Sections were stained using DAB Substrate Kit (Cell Signaling, USA) for 5 min and then hematoxylin  regent  (Cell  Signaling,  USA)  for  5  min.  The  positive expression  of  CD86  and  CD206  was  observed  under  a  microscope (Olympus, Japan) and then qualified by the Image Pro-Plus 6.0 software (Media Cybernetics, Bethesda, MD, USA).

## 2.10. Immunofluorescence for METs

The  formation  of  METs  could  be  evaluated  by  detecting  the  co-

localization of F4/80 (a marker of macrophage) and citH3 in cells. For cell samples, cells seeded on sterile glass coverslips were cultured with 4 % paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature before the permeabilization using 0.5 % Triton-100 for 5 min at room temperature. Cells and sections were blocked using 5 % bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature. Samples were incubated with anti-citH3 (NB10057135,  1:10000,  Novus  Biologicals,  USA)  and  anti-F4/80  (NB600404SS, 1:500, Novus Biologicals, USA) overnight at 4 ℃ and then with secondary antibody (NB7156, 1:10000, Novus Biologicals, USA) for 1 h at room temperature in dark. Hoechst regent (5 μ g/mL) was added in samples to stain the nuclei. Samples were processed by the fluorescence antifade agent, followed by the observation using confocal laser scanning  microscope  (Olympus,  Japan).  Green  fluorescence  represented citH3 expresion, while red fluorescence indicated F4/80 expression. The overlap of F4/80 and citH3 fluorescence staining showed the formation of METs.

## 2.11. Bodipy label for estimating lipid peroxidation

Bodipy label  (HY-W090090, MedChemExpress, USA) was used to label the polar lipid. Briefly, 0.1 % Bodipy label in DMSO was used to incubate  cells  for  5 -30  min  at  room  temperature,  followed  by  the measurement of fluorescence microscope.

## 2.12. Statistical analysis

Statistical  analysis  was  assessed  by  SPSS  22.0  and  GraphPad  9.0. Data of animal experiments were shown as mean ± standard error of mean (SEM). Results from cellular experiments were expressed as mean ± standard deviation. Each cell experiment was repeated independently at least three times. In this study, each experiment and analysis contained  at  least  three  groups.  Thus,  the  difference  comparison  among multiple groups (at least in three groups) was processed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and then the differences among these groups were verified by the post-hoc Tukey s test. The significant dif-' ference  was  determined  when  p  value &lt; 0.05  at  95  %  confidence interval.

## 3. Results

## 3.1. Liraglutide significantly repressed ferroptosis and alleviate RIRI

Liraglutide inhibited ferroptosis-induced renal dysfunction since it skewed macrophage polarization into M2 phenotype that interfered the formation of extracellular traps based on STAT3/6 pathway during RIRI. In RIRI mice, renal injury was characterized by renal interstitial fibrosis with infiltration in inflammatory cells and exfoliation of renal tubular epithelial cells (Fig. 1A). Liraglutide treatment significantly improved these pathological changes in renal tissue of RIRI mice (Fig. 1a), which resulted  in  the  decrease  of  tubular  injury  score  (Fig.  1B).  Also,  the enhanced  levels  of  BUN  and  serum  creatinine  were  inhibited  by  liraglutide  treatment  during  RIRI  progression  (Fig.  1C,D).  Then,  we observed ferroptosis with the elevation of iron and MDA as well as the reduction of GSH in RIRI mice (Fig. 1e-g). Instead, iron and MDA were repressed while GSH were increased after liraglutide treatment (Fig. 1EG). The levels of ferroptosis-associated proteins GPX4, ATF3 and ACSL4 were measured to describe ferroptosis at the molecular level. GPX4 was suppressed whereas ATF3 and ACSL4 enhanced in RIRI mice (Fig. 1H-K). Importantly, these changes were reversed due to liraglutide treatment (Fig. 1H-K). Moreover, Figure S1 showed that liraglutide also inhibited cleaved caspase 1 and cleaved caspase 3 but caused no statistical change in MLKL. Thus, liraglutide inhibited apoptosis and ferroptosis whereas it did not affect programmed necrosis.

## 3.2. Liraglutide reduced METs formation during RIRI progression

To examine whether METs were present in RIRI and the effect of liraglutide on METs, we measured the components of METs including DNA release, serum MPO and serum NE in RIRI mice. As a result, the increased levels of extracellular DNA, MPO and NE were found in RIRI mice, whereas liraglutide inhibited these alterations (Fig. 2A-C). Next, we observed liraglutide obviously suppressed the RIRI-elevated levels of citH3 (a marker of extracellular trap), MPO and NE (Fig. 2D). Moreover, the results from immunofluorescence showed that citH3 and F4/80 (a marker of macrophage) were actively expressed in RIRI mice. Particularly, the distribution of citH3 overlapped with that of F4/80, indicating the obvious formation of METs in RIRI (Fig. 2E). Dramatically, liraglutide repressed the fluorescence intensity of the two proteins, showing liraglutide inhibited METs formation in RIRI (Fig. 2E,S2).

## 3.3. Macrophage polarization was affected by liraglutide treatment in RIRI mice

Interestingly, I/R condition significantly increased CD86 expression (M1 marker) and slightly elevated CD206 (M2 marker) in addition to enhancement of iNOS (M1 marker) and Arg-1 (M2 marker) (Fig. 3A,B). This condition failed to alter IL-10 expression that inhibited M1 polarization in macrophage (Fig. 3B). However, liraglutide inhibited iNOS expression and positive CD86 but enhanced Arg-1, IL-10 and positive CD206 (Fig. 3A,B), suggesting liraglutide promoted M2 phenotype in macrophage during  RIRI.  Also,  qPCR  showed  the  similar  changes  of CD86, iNOS, Arg-1 and IL-10 in liraglutide-treated RIRI mice (Fig. 3C-F). Notably,  there  was  a  marked  activation  of  STAT  pathway  with  the upregulated phosphorylation of STAT1, 3, 6 in RIRI (Fig. 3G). Liraglutide caused STAT1 inactivation but further enhanced the phosphorylation of STAT3, 6 (Fig. 3G), suggesting the potential relationship between liraglutide and STAT pathway in RIRI progression. Fig. 3H showed that I/R condition elevated serum IL-10 while liraglutide inhibited the I/Rinduced elevation in IL-10.

## 3.4. Liraglutide regulated macrophage polarization and MET formation in vitro

I/R induced the increase of M1 given the upregulation of iNOS and CD86  and  the  downregulation  of  Arg-1  and  IL-10  in  mice  with  I/R (Fig. S3A-D). However, liraglutide treatment promoted Arg-1 and IL-10 and inhibited iNOS and CD84 (Fig. S3A-D). Further, p-STAT1, STAT1, pSTAT3, STAT3, p-STAT6 and STAT6 in kidney tissue were detected by western blot (Fig. S3E). Obviously, p-STAT1/STAT1, p-STAT3/STAT3 and  p-STAT6/STAT6  were  significantly  increased  by  I/R  modelling. Nevertheless,  liraglutide  decreased  p-STAT1/STAT1  and  increased  pSTAT3/STAT3 and p-STAT6/STAT6. This indicated that I/R pathology led  to  the  activation  of  STAT1,  STAT3  and  STAT6,  while  liraglutide inhibited STAT1 activation and promoted the activation of STAT3 and STAT6. To explore whether extracellular traps mediated the liraglutideassociated effect in M1/M2 polarization, we cultured RAW264.7 cells under H/R condition and treated it with liraglutide. According to the fluorescence  intensity,  H/R  condition  induced  citH3  expression  in RAW264.7 cells, which indicated METs formation. citH3 expression was suppressed under the treatment of liraglutide or Cl-amidine (an inhibitor of  METs) (Fig. 4A). Similarly, liraglutide or Cl-amidine inhibited the expression of citH3, MPO and NE in H/R-induced RAW264.7 based on western blotting (Fig. 4B), showing METs was repressed after liraglutide or  Cl-amidine  treatment.  We  further  demonstrated  that  liraglutide regulated M1/M2 polarization in H/R-stimulated RAW264.7 via METs (Fig. 4C-G). On the one hand, liraglutide decreased CD 86 and iNOS that were  associated  with  M1  phenotype.  Liraglutide-evoked  elevation  of Arg-1 and IL-10, indicating that liraglutide promoted M2 polarization in H/R-induced RAW264.7. Importantly, we observed liraglutide contributed to STAT pathway activation with the elevated phosphorylation of

STAT3, 6 and the decreased phosphorylation of STAT1 in H/R-induced macrophage  (Fig.  4H).  H/R  condition  elevated  serum  IL-10,  which further decreased by liraglutide (Fig. 4I).

## 3.5. Liraglutide repressed macrophage-induced ferroptosis in H/Rstimulated renal tubular epithelium

To clarify  whether  liraglutide  could  control  macrophage-involved ferroptosis in H/R-stimulated renal tubular epithelial cells via destroying extracellular traps, the cell model of renal tubular epithelial cell cocultured  with  macrophage  under  H/R  condition  was  established.  As results, macrophage enhanced H/R-evoked ferroptosis with the decrease of GSH and the increase of MDA and iron (Fig. 5A-C). However, ferroptosis was partly inhibited when we treated the cell model with liraglutide or Ci-amidine, which was characterized by the increased GSH and the decrease of MDA and iron (Fig. 5A-C). At the molecular level, ATF3  and  ACSL4  were  upregulated  and  GPX4  were  downregulated when renal tubular epithelial cells were co-incubated with macrophage under H/R condition (Fig. 5D-G). Obviously, liraglutide or Cl-amidine could reverse these alterations of ferroptosis-associated proteins, with the elevation of GPX4 and the reduction of ATF3 and ACSL4 (Fig. 5D-G). Fig.  5H  illustrated  the  change  in  ferroptosis  based  on  bodipy  label. Compared  with  control  group,  H/R  condition  led  to  the  increase  of bodipy-labeled cells, suggesting ferroptosis was activated by H/R condition. Liraglutide treatment rescued the increased ferroptosis induced by H/R. Importantly, RAW 264.7 cell further increased bodipy-labeled renal tubular epithelial cells undergoing H/R condition, which, however, was inhibited by liraglutide treatment. As well as Fer-1, liraglutide inhibited MDA and iron, and promoted GSH in H/R-stimulated renal tubular epithelial cells co-cultured with RAW 264.7 (Fig. S4A-C). Also, both of liraglutide and Fer-1 inhibited ATF3 and elevated GPX4 and ACSL4 in H/R-stimulated renal tubular epithelial cells co-cultured with RAW 264.7 (Fig. S4D). Collectively, liraglutide repressed macrophageinduced ferroptosis in H/R-stimulated renal tubular epithelial cells by regulating ferroptosis-associated proteins.

3.6. STAT3/6 pathway contributed to improve macrophage-related ferroptosis and renal injury during liraglutide treatment

To reveal STAT3/6 pathway mediated liraglutide-involved ferroptosis inhibition that involving in renal injury in RIRI, we utilized stattic (STAT3  inhibitor)  and  AS1517499  (STAT6  inhibitor)  to  inhibit  the activation  of  STAT3/6  pathway,  respectively.  Significantly,  stattic  or AS1517499 enhanced liraglutide-inhibited renal injury including renal fibrosis, inflammatory cells infiltration and exfoliation of renal tubular epithelial cells (Fig. 6A). Alteration of renal injury score verified the role of STAT3/6 pathway inactivation in liraglutide-treated RIRI progression (Fig. 6B). Liraglutide-decreased levels of BUN and Scr were reverted by stattic and AS1517499 (Fig. 6C,D), showing STAT3/6 pathway inactivation contributed to renal dysfunction during liraglutide treatment. For ferroptosis, we observed MAD and iron were upregulated while GSH downregulated after the treatment of stattic or AS1517499  in liraglutide-treated RIRI mice (Fig. 6E-G). Also, expression of ferroptosisassociated  proteins  were  altered  due  to  STAT3/6  inactivation  in liraglutide-treated RIRI mice. For example, we demonstrated inhibition of STAT3/6 reversed liraglutide-induced changes in proteins including GPX4, ATF3 and ACSL4 in RIRI (Fig. 6H-K).

3.7. Liraglutide inhibited macrophage polarization and METs formation via STAT3/6 pathway

Figure S5 suggested Stattic and AS1517499 promoted M1 polarization in mice with I/R to reverse the promotive role of liraglutide in M2 polarization. Then, we researched whether liraglutide inhibited macrophage polarization and METs via STAT3/6 pathway. As a result, STAT3/6 inactivation elevated liraglutide-repressed contents of

extracellular traps containing extracellular DNA, MPO and NE (Fig. 7AC).  In  RIRI  mice,  STAT3/6  inactivation  upregulated  expressions  of citH3, MPO and NE although liraglutide previously suppressed these proteins  (Fig.  7D).  Moreover,  the  liraglutide-inhibited  distribution  of citH3  and  F4/80  was  rescued  by  STAT3/6  inhibitors  in  RIRI  mice (Fig. 7E,S6), further evidencing that STAT3/6 pathway mediated the regulatory role of liraglutide in MET formation. For macrophage polarization, liraglutide promoted CD206 expression and inhibited CD86 expression, but stattic and AS1517499 promoted M1 polarization due to the enhancement of CD86 and the reduction of CD206 (Fig. 7F). Further, stattic and AS1517499 caused changes in polarization-related proteins including increases of iNOS and CD86 with decreases of Arg-1 and IL-10, although liraglutide increased the expression of M2 polarization-related proteins (Fig. 7G-K). In addition, similar to above results, STAT pathway was activated by liraglutide with the phosphorylation of STAT3/6 during RIRI, and the treatment of static and AS1517499 inactivated STAT3 and  STAT6,  respectively (Fig. 7L). Fig. 7M  showed  stattic  and AS1517499 treatment reversed the role of liraglutide in IL-10 (Fig. 7M).

Taken  together, Liraglutide inhibited ferroptosis-induced renal dysfunction since it skewed macrophage polarization into M2 phenotype that interfered the formation of extracellular traps based on STAT3/6 pathway during RIRI (Fig. 8).

## 4. Discussion

In the present study, we found liraglutide improved the dysfunction and  pathological  injury  in  kidney  during  I/R  through  inhibiting  ferroptosis.  Importantly,  we determined ferroptosis in the renal tubular epithelial cell was inhibited by macrophage polarization and MET formation under liraglutide treatment.

Liraglutide has been shown to mitigate tissue necrosis and ameliorate organ function in I/R injury. Experimental models with cerebral and myocardial I/R injury benefited from liraglutide treatment [32,33]. For RIRI progression, liraglutide can partly alleviate renal tubulointerstitial injury and reduce immunocyte infiltration via the mimetic the peptide structure of GLP-1 [34]. Potentially, the liraglutide-involved protection may be attributed to the reduction of ferroptosis in kidney. Our findings showed RIRI mice with liraglutide treatment had a decrease of oxidative stress and iron accumulation, indicating the obvious downregulation of ferroptosis due to liraglutide. Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent form of cell death, and lipid peroxidation resulting from excessive iron accumulation exacerbates cellular irreversible oxidative stress damage [35]. Accumulation of iron and MDA, and deletion of GSH are major ferroptotic events [36]. In this work, liraglutide was suggested to be effective in reducing iron and MDA accumulation and elevating GSH level in mice with RIRI, revealing its suppression on ferroptosis in RIRI. In some other diseases,  the  repression  of  liraglutide  on  ferroptotic  events,  such  as inhibiting iron and MDA accumulation and increasing GSH expression, has  been  reported  [23,24].  However,  the  influence  of  liraglutide  on ferroptosis has never been reported in RIRI. This was the first time that liraglutide was instructed to relieve RIRI by alleviating ferroptosis.

METs may lead to necroinflammation and renal tubular necrosis, and even renal failure [37,17]. We firstly revealed liraglutide inhibited the formation of extracellular traps structure in H/R-induced macrophage. Compared with the positive control inhibiting METs, liraglutide significantly  reduced  ferroptosis  and  interfered  expressions  of  ferroptosisassociated  proteins  via  repressing  MET  formation.  Moreover,  Wang et  al.  [38] observed  that  ferroptosis  promoted  macrophage  enriched around damaged renal tubular epithelial cells that induced acute kidney injury,  indicating  a  positive  feedback  loop  between  macrophage  and ferroptosis. Also, when components in METs trigger the massive accumulation of ROS inducing the significant ferroptosis in renal tubular epithelial  cells,  ferroptosis  reciprocally  recruits  macrophage  into  the kidney to maintain the immune response. Without co-incubation with macrophage, we still observed liraglutide showed the similar inhibition to  ferroptosis  in  H/R-induced  renal  tubular  epithelial  cells.  We  have

determined macrophage-dependent pathway mediates ferroptosis during liraglutide treatment, but it needs experimental evidence to explore the potential macrophage-independent pathway  of liraglutide in ferroptosis-associated RIRI.

Notably, we also showed that M1/M2 polarization contributed to extracellular trap formation in macrophage when RIRI occurred. The two common phenotypes of macrophages are defined: classically activated macrophage (M1) contributing to antigen presentation and activation  in  type-1T-cell  response,  which  is  charactered  by  the  major profile  of  IL-12/23;  and  alternatively  activated  macrophage  (M2) described  as  the  anti-inflammatory  phenotype  that  is  capable  of immunosuppression and the production of IL-4/10/13 [39]. Mechanistically, the epithelial-mesenchymal transition in renal tubular epithelial cells is inhibited by liraglutide due to decreases of M1 markers [40].

Meanwhile, liraglutide-elevated M2 polarization has immunosuppressive  effects  to  resist  the  inflammation  in  RIRI.  Beyond  that,  M1/M2 polarization potentially mediates the formation of extracellular traps in macrophage. A report by Chen et al. [41] showed the correlation between METs and inflammation. They found inflammation was positively correlated to METs in clinic, indicating pro-inflammatory phenotype of macrophage  might  tend  to  form  the  structure  of  extracellular  traps. Rayner  et  al.  [42] demonstrated  that  M1  macrophage  was  easier  to enrich DNA and granule proteins into the extracellular microenvironment when these cells were undergoing the external toxic stimulation. Thus, liraglutide-induced changes in M1/M2 polarization suggest liraglutide  is  able  to  elevate  M2  phenotype  to  inhibit  the  formation  of METs,  thereby  repressing  ferroptosis  in  renal  tubular  epithelial  cells during RIRI.

STAT pathway determines the direction of macrophage polarization via the different activation pathways: a) TLR pathway enhances STAT1 phosphorylation in STAT pathway to skew macrophage phenotype toward M1; b) IL-4/13-induced activation of STAT pathway causes M2 polarization through STAT3 and STAT6 [43]. It is the common event that STAT pathway is altered during RIRI progression [44]. We determined liraglutide downregulated phosphorylation of STAT1 and activated STAT3/6 as before. Liraglutide treatment led to the activation of STAT3/6 with the inhibition of STAT1 that skew macrophage function into M2 phenotype. As mentioned, we inferred liraglutide can control ferroptosis in renal tubular  epithelial cells via the macrophageindependent pathway. Potentially, STAT3 activation plays the significant  role  in  this  pathway.  Qiang  et  al.  [45] found  ferroptosis  was aggravated  in  response  to  STAT3  inhibition  in  cellular.  Therefore, whether  liraglutide  targets  ferroptosis  in  RIRI  by  modulating  STAT3 activation  and  macrophage-dependent  pathways  need  to  be  further

demonstrated. In previous study, liraglutide has been discovered to relief RIRI  by  suppressing  the  high-mobility  group  box  1  nuclearcytoplasmic translocation and release [21]. However, at present, there is still a lack of research on whether liraglutide alleviates RIRI by acting on other pathways. This paper firstly instructed that liraglutide might alleviate RIRI by inactivating the STAT3/6 pathway.

This study has limitations. This work used a single animal model and lacked validation in human tissues. The validation in human tissues and the study of multiple animal models will be more meaningful. Due to laboratory limitations, these studies could not be performed at present, which will be the focus in the future study.

In summary, we demonstrated liraglutide could inhibit ferroptosisinduced  renal  dysfunction  since  it  skewed  macrophage  polarization into  M2  phenotype  that  interfered  the  formation  of  METs  based  on STAT3/6 pathway during RIRI progression.  The  novel  insight  in  liraglutide provide  the  potential therapeutic  method  resisting  RIRI

progression based on macrophage-related ferroptosis.
