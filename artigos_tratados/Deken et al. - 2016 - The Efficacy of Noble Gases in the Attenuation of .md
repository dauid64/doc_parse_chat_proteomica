## Abstract

Objective : Noble gases have been attributed organ protective effects in ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI) in a variety of medical conditions, including cerebral and cardiac ischemia, acute kidney injury, and transplantation. The aim of this study was to appraise the available evidence by systematically reviewing the literature and performing meta-analyses.

Data Sources : PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library.

Study Selection: Inclusion criteria specified any articles on noble gases and either IRI or transplantation. In  vitro studies,  publications  without  full  text,  review  articles  and  letters  were excluded.

Data Extraction: Information on noble gas, organ, species, model, length of ischemia, conditioning and noble gas dose, duration of administration of the gas, endpoints and effects was extracted from 79 eligible  articles.  Study  quality  was  evaluated  using  the  Jadad  scale.  Effect  sizes  were  extracted from  the  articles  or  retrieved  from  the  authors  to  allow  meta-analyses  using  the  random-effects approach.

Data Synthesis: Argon has been investigated in cerebral, myocardial, and renal IRI; helium and xenon have  additionally  been  tested  in  hepatic  IRI;  while  neon  was  only  explored  in  myocardial  IRI.  The majority  of  studies  show  a  protective  effect  of  these  noble  gases  on  IRI  across  a  broad  range  of experimental conditions, organs and species. Overall study quality was low. Meta-analysis for argon was  only  possible  in  cerebral  IRI  and  did  not  show  neuroprotective  effects.  Helium  proved neuroprotective  in  rodents  and  cardioprotective  in  rabbits,  there  were  too  few  data  on  renal  IRI. Xenon had the most consistent effects, being neuroprotective in rodents, cardioprotective in rodents and pigs and renoprotective in rodents.

Conclusion: Helium  and  xenon  show  organ  protective  effects  mostly  in  small  animal  IRI  models. Additional  information  on  timing,  dosing  and  comparative  efficacy  of  the  different  noble  gases  as well as confirmation in large animal models is needed before designing clinical trials.

## Introduction

Ischemia  reperfusion  injury  (IRI)  is  a  major  contributor  to  morbidity  and  mortality  in  a  variety  of medical conditions, including cerebral, cardiac, and intestinal ischemia, acute kidney injury, and solid organ  transplantation.  Tissue  hypoperfusion  and  ischemia  are  also  frequently  encountered  in critically  ill  patients  and  significantly  contribute  to  multi-organ  failure  and  perioperative  death.  An effective  treatment of  IRI  is  currently  not  available  (1)  but  the  use  of  inhalational  drugs,  including volatile anesthetics (2, 3) and noble gases, to attenuate IRI is increasingly explored. Of the six noble gases  (helium,  neon,  argon,  krypton,  xenon,  and  radon),  two  are  used  medically.  While  helium  is occasionally used to ventilate patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (4), xenon exhibits anesthetic  properties  under  normobaric  conditions,  provides  the  fastest  onset  and  recovery  from anesthesia of all known anesthetics, and has a remarkably safe cardiovascular profile (5-7).

The use of noble gases to treat IRI has been investigated since the early 1970s, but no published comprehensive reviews are available. The aim of this study was to appraise the current evidence by systematically reviewing the literature and performing meta-analyses.

## Methods

This  study  was  conducted  according  to  the  Preferred  Reporting  Items  for  Systematic  Reviews  and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines (8). It has been registered with the National Institute for Health Research (PROSPERO) (CRD42015021934).

## Data sources, search details, and eligibility criteria

PubMed,  EMBASE,  and  the  Cochrane  Library  were  searched  for 'ischemia reperfusion  injury   or ' 'transplantation'  and  'noble  gases' March 2 nd ,  2014 (Fig.S1).  Relevant  synonyms  and subcategories were included. The search strategy was set up in conjunction with experienced librarians. No limits were specified. To identify potentially relevant studies, title and abstract of all articles were screened

by two independent reviewers (with discrepancies resolved by a third reviewer). Next, the full texts of  the  pertinent  articles  were  assessed  for  eligibility.  Additionally,  reference  lists  of  all  included articles were checked for any relevant papers that were not identified in the primary search. In vivo and ex vivo studies (animal and human) evaluating the effects of noble gases on IRI or organ function post-transplantation were included. Exclusion criteria were: in vitro studies, publication without full text, review articles, letters, and language other than English, French, Dutch, German or Spanish. The Supplement Digital Content gives additional information on the search strategy.

## Data extraction and meta-analyses

Abstracted  information  from  included  articles  included  but  was  not  limited  to:  type  of  noble  gas, administration method, concentration, duration of administration, organ, species, gender, number of animals, endpoints and duration of follow-up. Quantitative data on the effect size of a single noble gas  compared  to  control  were  extracted  for  primary  and  secondary  endpoints  to  perform  metaanalyses. Effect sizes were grouped as a function of type of organ (brain, heart, kidney, liver), species (rat/mouse, rabbit, pig) and endpoint. Endpoints were clustered as either referring to organ injury (infarct size, histological changes,…) or function (neurological function, kidney function,… ). Standardized effect sizes (SES) were calculated with a positive value referring to a better outcome in the treatment group. The random-effects approach was used to combine SESs (9). The Supplemental Digital  Content  details  the  meta-analytical  strategy.  Analyses  were  performed  using  SAS  software, version 9.2 for Windows.

## Quality assessment

The  quality  of  the  reported  experiments  was  scored  using  the  Jadad-scale  which  considers randomization,  double  blinding,  methods  of  blinding/randomisation,  and  whether  all  participants were  included  in  the  analysis  (10).  Although  the  Jadad-scale  was  not  developed  for  preclinical research, there are no alternatives (11). We therefore additionally report whether the sample size

was calculated, animal characteristics were given and if the optimal time window and dose-response were investigated (11).

## Defining the 'conditioning' setting

The  time  at  which  the  gas  is  given  relative  to  IRI  determines  the  'conditioning'  setting.  In preconditioning,  gas  administration  is  started  before  the  onset  of  ischemia;  in  reconditioning  it  is administered during ongoing ischemia; and in postconditioning after reperfusion.

## Results

## Study selection and data extraction

The search identified 2108 articles (PubMed: 987, EMBASE: 1093, Cochrane Library: 28) (Fig. 1) of which 59 were found eligible. An additional 386 potential articles were identified from the references of which 20 were eligible. In total, 79 articles were included in the qualitative analysis. Of these, 7 investigated argon, 22 helium, 56 xenon, and 1 neon. Five articles compared noble gases. All but 3 were  animal  studies.  Quantitative  data  for  meta-analyses  could  be  extracted  from  50  papers resulting in 244 effect sizes.

## Quality Assessment

Randomisation was performed in 71% (56/79) of studies. Only 5% (4/79) of the experiments were performed  double  blind,  meaning  that,  for  animal  studies,  both  the  investigators  performing  the experiments and the investigators assessing the outcome were blinded. In contrast 49% (39/79) were single blinded studies. Nearly all studies (78/79) mention animal characteristics but only 61% (48/79) provide  details  on  animal  drop-out.  20%  (16/79)  of  studies  describe  sample  size  calculation.  23% investigated dose-response relationships (18/79) and 16% the most effective window of opportunity (13/79). 41% (32/79) received 2/5 on the Jadad-scale. 16% (13/79) scored 3/5 on the Jadad-scale and were the highest scoring articles (Tables 1, S2-4).

## Data synthesis

Tables S5-7 give a overview of the studies included in the systematic review. They summarize the animal model used, the type of injury inflicted, the duration, timing and dose of noble gas administration, the endpoints and effects. Table S8 shows the individual SESs of all endpoints included in the different meta-analyses.

## Argon (Table S5)

<!-- image -->

## Brain

Individual  studies  with  argon postconditioning in  experiments  of  brain  ischemia  in  rodents  report improved  neuron  survival  and  neurological  function  (12-15).  A dose-response  experiment  showed better results for higher doses: neurological outcome in rats after 7 min of cardiac arrest was best when 70% argon was inhaled (14). Notably, the meta-analysis did not  show  a  beneficial  effect  of argon in this setting (Fig. 2, Table 1).

No experiments on argon preconditioning are available.

## Heart

One report showed a reduction in myocardial infarct size after preconditioning with argon 70% using three intermittent 5 min exposures (16).

## Kidney

Reconditioning rat  kidneys  by  preserving  them  in  an  argon-saturated  perfusion  solution  showed higher creatinine clearance post-transplantation when compared to controls (17).

## Helium (Table S6)

## Brain

Late preconditioning with  3x5  min  of  70%  helium  significantly  reduced  the  infarct  ratio  (area  of infarcted  brain  tissue/area  at  risk)  in  rodents.  Furthermore,  it  increased  the  number  of  viable neurons and improved sensorimotor function 5 weeks later (18).

Helium was also investigated during postconditioning with only  high  doses  being effective, as 70% helium  (but  not  30%)  inhaled  during  1h  immediately  postreperfusion  reduced  infarct  size  and neurologic  deficit.  The  protective  effect  disappeared  when  helium  was  started  30  or  60  min postreperfusion (19). On the other hand, some studies show that helium is protective even when started later after reperfusion: 3h of 75% helium started 1h after reperfusion reduced infarct volume and neurologic deficit (20). Helium also improved neurological function but was unable to decrease infarct volume when administered 2h after reperfusion (12).

Starting  70%  helium  during  ischemia  and  continuing  it  during  postreperfusion  decreased  infarct volume and neurological deficit as well (21).

Meta-analyses  summarizing  these  various  findings  showed  that  helium  improves  neurological function but has no effect on infarct size (Fig. 3, Table 1).

## Endothelium

In  human  volunteers,  3x5  min  cycles  of preconditioning with  79%  helium  24h  or  5  min  before forearm ischemia, induced by inflating a blood pressure cuff, preserved the endothelial response to the vasodilator acetylcholine on venous occlusion plethysmography, while this response was blunted in controls (22). In a different setting with continuous inhalation of 50% helium from 15 min before to 5 min after IRI, inflammatory and pro-coagulant markers were reduced in human volunteers but endothelial function did not improve (23).

## Heart

Individual rodent and rabbit studies show that 3x5 min of 70% helium preconditioning significantly reduced infarct ratios (16, 24-31). In rabbits, one cycle of 5 min reduced infarct ratio, but 3 cycles were more potent with no added benefit of 5 cycles (28). However, Pagel found a reduced infarct ratio after 1 cycle of helium combined with morphine, but not after 1 cycle of helium (25).

Late preconditioning with 30, 50, or 70% helium significantly reduced infarct ratios in a rodent model of  cardiac  ischemia  (32).  Repeated  helium  exposure  at  48  or  72h  before  ischemia  did  not  reduce infarct ratio further (32).

Similarly, 15 min of postconditioning reduced infarct ratio, but no additive effect was found when postconditioning was supplemented with preconditioning (33).

Interestingly, the efficacy of helium pre- and postconditioning seems to depend upon the absence of obesity (31). When lean and obese Zucker rats with 25 min of left coronary artery ligation received pre-  or  postconditioning,  infarct  ratio  was  only  reduced  in  lean  rats.  This  was  likely  caused  by  a reduced effect of helium on mitochondrial respiration (31).

Reconditioning (15 min pre- until 3h post-IRI) with 70% helium had no effect (34).

Combining these data in meta-analyses showed a significant effect of helium on infarct size in rabbits and a positive, non-significant effect in rodents (Fig. 3, Table 1).

## Kidney

Reconditioning rabbit kidney grafts with hyperbaric helium at different pressures during cold storage did not improve outcomes compared  with hyperbaric oxygen (35). However, dog kidneys transplanted  after  12  days  of  cold  storage  at  -32°C  had  improved  creatinine  clearance  when hyperbaric helium was added to the storage solution (36).

## Liver

In  contrast  to  ischemic  preconditioning, preconditioning with  70%  helium  before  partial  hepatic ischemia in a rat model did not change levels of serum transaminases (37).

## Xenon (Table S7)

## Brain

Preconditioning

In  rats,  xenon  preconditioning  2h  before  injury  had  no  effects  on  ischemic  brain  injury,  while preconditioning 4, 8 or 24h before ischemia reduced infarct volumes and neurologic deficit, the latter only tested  for  preconditioning  at  4h  (38).  Late  preconditioning with  70%  xenon  for 2h  decreased infarct  size  and  focal  neurological  deficit  in  mice  of  both  genders  (39).  In  a  rat  model  of  neonatal asphyxia, a dose-response study found higher xenon-doses to be more efficient as 75% xenon but not  30% reduced infarct size. Interestingly,  the  combination  of 20%  xenon  and  0.75%  sevoflurane also  protected  the  brain,  although  neither  was  effective  individually  (40).  Rat  pups  exposed  to intrauterine  perinatal  asphyxia  4h  after  treatment  of  the  mother  with  35%  xenon  showed  less neurological deficit, neural loss, cellular disorganization and cell shrinkage (41). Reconditioning

Rodent  experiments  on  xenon  reconditioning  have  repeatedly  demonstrated  decrease  of  infarct volume and neurological deficit (42-44). In dose-response studies, 70% xenon was found to be most effective  with  respect  to  histological  findings  and  neurologic  function,  but  positive  results  were already observed with concentrations as low as 35-40% (42, 43). 60% xenon during cardiopulmonary bypass ameliorated bypass-induced neurocognitive damage in rats (44).

Xenon reconditioning during cardiac arrest in pigs showed decreased brain injury markers (glycerol, lactate) (45).

Postconditioning

All included rodent experiments showed that xenon-postconditioning improved neurologic outcome, reduced  infarct size and  histological injury (12, 43, 46-55). One  study  observed  long-term neurological  improvement  at  10  weeks  follow-up  (50).  In  two  studies,  xenon  was  delivered  via echogenic  liposomes  encapsulating  the  gas  in  a  hydrophilic  core  surrounded  by  a  phospholipid bilayer.  Ultrasound  exposure  triggered  the  release  of  the  gas  from  the  liposome  at  the  target location, resulting in a reduction in infarct size and significantly better neurologic outcomes (46, 51). The protective effects of xenon were most pronounced when administered soon after the ischemic

insult,  preferably  within  8h  (43,  47,  51).  Of  note,  xenon  combined  additively  with  hypothermia  to

provide neuroprotection, even when administered asynchronously (43, 50, 54, 56). In rats, the coadministration  of  3h  of  hypothermia  together  with  60  min  of  xenon  improved  histology  and behavioral  testing  compared  with  hypothermia  alone.  Interestingly,  female  rats  receiving  any combination of hypothermia and xenon performed significantly better at the motor test, while no gender-related differences could be found on histology (54).

In  a  rat  model  of  thromboembolic  stroke,  administration  of  50%  xenon  after  45  min  of  cerebral ischemia and subsequent injection of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) reduced infarct volumes and suppressed  cerebral  hemorrhage.  Notably,  the  simultaneous  intra-ischemic  co-administration  of xenon and tPA led to an increased infarct volume (53). Several in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo studies have shown that noble gases are tPA-ihibitors.(53, 57-59)

Dose-dependent protective effects of xenon were shown in a perinatal focal ischemia model in which neuroprotection was demonstrated with xenon concentrations ≥60% (43). Paradoxically, decreased neurological deficit and infarct volume were shown with xenon 30%, but not with 15% or 45%. The effect of 30% xenon was no longer apparent 28 days post-injury (52).

The ideal duration of xenon administration was also investigated and 8, 20 and 44h of 30% xenon all demonstrated improved neurological function 7 days after injury (52).

Low  dose  xenon  (20%)  in  combination  with  hypothermia  (35°C)  administered  4h  after  the  insult decreased neuronal injury and neurological deficit while neither did so individually (43).

These promising results in rodent models could only be partly reproduced in porcine models. Fries performed three studies in which pigs were exposed to 8 or 10 min of cardiac arrest followed by resuscitation and postconditioning with 70% xenon (60-62). Xenon administered 1h after resuscitation improved short-term neurocognitive function and histology, with animals receiving only 1h of xenon performing slightly (albeit not significantly) better than those receiving xenon during 5h (60).  When  xenon  administration  was  started  earlier,  at  10  min  after  resuscitation,  only  a  nonsignificant trend  towards  improved  neurologic  recovery  was  seen  (61).  These  findings  were corroborated  by  Derwall,  who,  in  a  similar  model,  found  the  same  positive  effect  of  delaying

postconditioning for 1h and a slight but non-significantly better result of 1h of xenon compared to 5h (63). The combination of either a short (1h) or long (18-24h) period of xenon administration and mild hypothermia immediately after resuscitation improved functional recovery and histologic injury (62, 64, 65). But not all studies reported an added benefit of the combined treatment over hypothermia alone (65).

## Meta-analyses

The meta-analysis of xenon administration in rodent models of brain ischemia showed neuroprotection  as  assessed  by  infarct size, histological changes,  and  neurological function. Summarizing the various finding in pigs could not show a significant effect for xenon when compared to controls (Fig. 4, Table 1).

## Spinal cord

Xenon postconditioning after  spinal  ischemia  in  rats  reduced  neurologic  deficit  and  increased  the number of normal neurons (66, 67). These findings could not be reproduced in a rabbit model using reconditioning (68).

## Heart

Early  xenon preconditioning in  rat  and ex  vivo rabbit  models  reduced  infarct  ratios,  improved function  and  reduced  the  release  of  cardiac  enzymes  (69-73).  Weber  linked  the  preconditioning mechanism to the cytoskeleton (74). Late preconditioning reduced the infarct ratio in rats as  well (75). In contrast, early xenon preconditioning in pigs did not reduce infarct size (76).

Xenon postconditioning has  rarely  been  studied,  but  beneficial  effects  on  infarct  sizes  have  been reported  (77,  78).  Schwiebert  found  a  positive  effect  of  xenon  postconditioning  only  for  the simultaneous administration of xenon and hypothermia which might be attributed to the use of low xenon concentrations (20%) in this study (78).

Xenon reconditioning during  ligation  of  the  left  anterior  descending  artery  (LAD)  reduced  cardiac remodeling  in  a  rat  model  (79).  Similar  effects  were  found  after  LAD  ligation  in  large  animals

(pig/dog) in which infarct sizes were reduced (76, 80). This was however less effective than ischemic preconditioning (76). Of note, no effects could be seen with xenon preconditioning (76).

Moreover,  in  pigs,  Baumert  did  not  find  a  significant  difference  between  xenon  combined  with isoflurane and isoflurane alone (81). Hein exposed pigs to 70% xenon from 60 min before until 2h after ischemia and found positive effects on both infarct size and hemodynamic stability (82, 83). The same  model  showed  however  that  xenon  reconditioning  led  to  more  apoptotic  cells  in  the myocardium when compared to isoflurane anesthesia (84).

Xenon was cardioprotective in both rodent and pig models in meta-analyses (Fig. 4, Table 1).

## Kidney

Xenon preconditioning exerted beneficial effects on histology and renal function in rodents (85-89). In  a  rat  transplant  model,  both pre-  and  postconditioning decreased  delayed  graft  function  and allograft fibrosis, increasing graft function and survival (85-87).

Xenon reconditioning of  the  kidney  during  cold  storage  in  canine  kidney  transplant  models  in  the 1970s showed mixed results (35, 36, 90). More recent studies, where rat kidney grafts were coldstored  in  a  xenon-saturated  preservation  solution  and  then  transplanted,  showed  improved  graft function and histology (17, 91).

These  finding  were  confirmed  in  meta-analysis,  showing  improved  kidney  function  with  xenon administration (Fig.4, Table 1).

## Liver

A  case  series  on  xenon  anesthesia  during  liver  transplantation,  found  that  all  4  patients  were hemodynamically  stable,  no  complications  occurred  perioperatively  and  hepatic  function  was satisfactory 7 days postoperatively (92).

## Neon

## Heart

One study found a reduced infarct ratio of neon preconditioning in myocardial IRI compared to ischemic preconditioning (16).

## Studies directly comparing efficacy of noble gases

## Brain

Zhuang exposed neonatal rats to 90 min of 70% xenon, helium or argon 2h after hypoxic-ischemic brain injury (12). After 90 min of hypoxia, all three gases significantly increased the number of viable neurons, with only argon being able to restore cell viability to naive levels. Moreover, when 2h of

hypoxia were applied, the infarct volume was reduced only in animals treated with argon or xenon. Neurocognitive outcomes were improved by all.

## Heart

Pagel studied the effects of 3x5 min of 70% helium, argon or neon in a model of myocardial ischemia (16). Intermittent exposure to one of these three gases 5 min before ischemic injury reduced infarct ratio  with  an  efficacy  comparable  to  that  of  ischemic  preconditioning.  No  significant  differences between the noble gases could be found (16).

## Kidney

Storing dog kidneys in helium or xenon saturated perfusion fluid at -32°C for multiple days showed that although both gases improved kidney function after transplantation, only xenon had a positive effect on histology (35, 36). Irani found the xenon- and argon-saturation of cold storage solutions to protect  against  IRI  in  a  rat  kidney  transplantation  model,  with  this  effect  being  significantly  more pronounced for argon (17).

## Discussion

The majority of original studies included in this systematic review show a protective effect of noble gases  on  IRI  (argon:  6/7;  helium:  18/22;  xenon:  48/58;  neon:  1/1)  across  a  broad  range  of experimental conditions, organs and species. Protective effects were mostly described for histological endpoints, organ injury and function. Some studies showed equivalence between noble gases and controls, none revealed detrimental effects with noble gas treatment. When summarizing the  effect  sizes  reported  in  the  original  articles  by  meta-analyses,  helium  was  neuroprotective  in rodents and cardioprotective in rabbits. Xenon  exerted protective effects in cerebral, cardiac, and renal ischemia in rodents. In pigs, neuroprotection by xenon could not be confirmed, although it was cardioprotective. For argon, not enough effect sizes were available to allow meta-analyses for cardiac and renal IRI. Argon postconditioning after cerebral IRI did not reveal significant benefits of argon

over control. This is perhaps a surprising finding as original studies report neuroprotective effects of argon (recently summarized by several authors (93-95)).

The current  study  is  subject  to  inherent  limitations  that  should  be  taken  into  consideration  when interpreting the results. First, despite the broad search strategy and searching the reference lists of the  articles  for  additional  relevant  studies  as  well,  some  publications  were  likely  not  identified. Second, studies that have been published later than the day of the literature search might reveal information  that  could  change  the  findings  of  the  meta-analyses.  As  an  example,  two  papers  on neuroprotection by argon postconditioning in rodents have been published since the search (96, 97). Third, although some of the individual articles are of high quality, the vast majority achieve only low Jadad-scores. Fourth, data-extraction for meta-analyses was possible in only 50/79 papers included in  the  systematic  review  (Supplementary  Methods),  possibly  omitting  relevant  findings.    Last,  the dissimilarity  in  experimental  conditions  tested  in  the  various  original  studies  led  to  a  considerable heterogeneity  of  the  meta-analyses.  There  was  a  large  variability  of  reported  endpoints  and  a considerable variation in the experimental set-ups with use of different injury models (hypoxia vs. ischemia), degrees of injury (duration of hypoxia/ischemia), timings, concentrations, and durations of noble gas administration. Moreover, different endpoints, durations of ischemia times, and pre-, reand postconditioning were grouped to be able to perform meta-analyses. As a result, in most settings large  and  significant  values  for  heterogeneity  (I²  values)  were  obtained.  Therefore,  the  summary estimates  resulting  from  the  random-effects  meta-analyses  should  be  interpreted  as  a  mere summary  of  various  findings,  rather  than  referring  to  an  expected  effect  size  in  a  well-defined homogeneous setting.

Most  of  the  available  evidence  describes  the  efficacy  of  noble  gases  to  protect  against  warm ischemia of the brain, heart, and kidney in rodent models. Large animal models have only been used occasionally,  mainly  to  investigate  the  effects  of  xenon  on  IRI  in  brain  and  heart.  Although  organ protective effects are quite obvious in rodent studies, they are less obvious in large animals, stressing

the importance of well-designed large animal studies before conducting clinical trials. Human data are  even  scarcer.  The  search  strategy  only  identified  three  human  studies.  Two  investigated  the effects  of  helium  preconditioning  on  endothelial  function  and  produced  contradicting  results  (22, 23). A third study reports 4 cases of xenon anesthesia during liver transplantation (92). Two human trials  that  were not identified by our search strategy report on the use of xenon. Arola tested the safety  and  feasibility  of  mild  therapeutic  hypothermia  in  combination  with  or  without  xenon inhalation  in  33  survivors  of  out-of-hospital  cardiac  arrest  (98).  The  incidence  of  serious  adverse reactions was similar in both groups. Interestingly, 72h-post-arrival troponin was significantly less in the xenon+hypothermia group, probably indicating attenuation of myocardial reperfusion injury (98). Dingley  performed  a  feasibility  study  on  xenon  administration  during  hypothermia  in  14  infants suffering from peripartal asphyxia. No adverse effects were seen at 18 months follow-up (99). The same group recently published a feasibility report on xenon delivery during ambulance retrieval of 5 neonates (100). To the best of our knowledge there are no other reports on noble gas administration in the clinical setting of IRI.

There are important questions that need to be resolved before large clinical trials  can be started. First,  the  most  effective  time  point  of  noble  gas  administration  remains  largely  unknown.  Current evidence seems to show that all three windows of protection (i.e., pre-, post-, and reconditioning) can effectively be used, with preconditioning being most frequently investigated. Only three studies have  compared  the  effects  of  xenon  pre-  vs.  postconditioning  in  the  same  model  (85-87). Preconditioning  might  be  the  ideal  setting  for  surgical  procedures  with  a  predictable  onset  of ischemia (and reperfusion), including cardiovascular surgery, liver resection, partial nephrectomies, and  organ  procurement.  However,  in  most  clinical  settings,  the  onset  of  ischemia  is  unexpected and/or even not precisely traceable, e.g. in cerebral ischemia, myocardial infarction. In these cases, postconditioning  seems  to  be  the  only  pragmatic  option  for  noble  gases  to  exert  their  potentially protective effects. The transplant setting might particularly benefit from reconditioning, allowing the

explanted organ to be treated during the ischemic phase (using cold storage or machine perfusion) (101),  possibly  followed  by  postconditioning  in  the  recipient.  Second,  the  duration  of  noble  gas administration to obtain maximal protection is also still largely unknown and might even be organspecific.  Third,  very  few  studies  analyzed  dose-response  relationships  for  noble  gases in  vivo .  It seems that the extent of protection increases with the administered dose. However, it is unknown whether and how the doses that were found to be protective in animals can be translated to the human setting.  It  is  more  than  probable  that  different  species  show  different  sensitivity  to  noble gases, as is reflected by the different minimum alveolar concentrations for xenon in rodents, pigs and humans. Last, only a few studies directly compare the efficacy of different noble gases and therefore a  network  meta-analysis,  which  combines  direct  and  indirect  evidence,  was  not  performed  as  it would not be reliable. The comparisons between noble gases in a network meta-analysis would be based entirely on the indirect evidence and estimating 'network incoherence' would not be possible. Furthermore, since the performed meta-analyses yield estimates for each noble gas compared with a control condition, the reader might be tempted to use these estimates to compare the noble gases. However, such comparison would ignore the differences between the studies and is therefore not advisable. Nevertheless, the choice of noble gas has important financial and logistical implications. Xenon is extremely costly due to its scarcity (air contains only 87 ppb) and the herewith-associated complexity of purification. Due to its high costs, xenon has to be administered using closed-circuit ventilators  to  minimize  gas  losses.  These  ventilators  are  currently  not  ubiquitously  available. Moreover, xenon has anesthetic properties, requires administration by anesthesiologists and -in the setting of cerebral ischemia -may complicate neurological monitoring. In contrast, argon is the third most abundant element in our atmosphere (air contains ±1% argon) and therefore up to 100-times more cost-effective than xenon (94).

Although  a  detailed  overview  of  the  mechanisms  of  action  of  noble  gases  in  the  setting  of  IRI  is beyond the scope of this systematic review, it is worth mentioning that different mechanisms have

been  proposed:  suppression  of  apoptosis,  activation  of  pro-survival  pathways,  preservation  of mitochondrial integrity and anti-inflammatory activity. The interested reader can find an overview in Table 2.

## Conclusion

Noble gases show promising results  as  agents  for  reducing  IRI  in  the  brain,  heart,  and  kidney  but proper  identification  of  the  most  effective  noble  gas,  timing,  dose  and  duration  of  noble  gas administration  is  urgently  required.  Furthermore,  the  effects  observed  in  rodents  need  to  be confirmed in  preclinical  models  in  larger  animals  such  as  the  pig.  Additionally,  noble  gases  during hepatic IRI are underexplored and unexplored in lung, pancreas, and intestine.
