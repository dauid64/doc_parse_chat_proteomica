Background: Hepatocyte growth factor or scatter factor (HGF/SF) is a pleiotropic cytokine that has potent angiogenic properties. We have previously demonstrated that neutrophils (PMN) are directly angiogenic by releasing vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). We hypothesized that the acute inflammatory response can stimulate PMN to release HGF.

Aims: To examine the effects of inflammatory mediators on PMN HGF release and the effect of recombinant human HGF (rhHGF) on PMN adhesion receptor expression and PMN VEGF release.

Methods: In the first experiment, PMN were isolated from healthy volunteers and stimulated with tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF/afii9825 ), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), interleukin-8 (IL-8), and formyl methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP). Culture supernatants were assayed for HGF using ELISA. In the second experiment, PMN were lysed to measure total HGF release and HGF expression in the PMN was detected by Western immunoblotting. Finally, PMN were stimulated with rhHGF. PMN CD 11a, CD 11b, and CD 18 receptor expression and VEGF release was measured using flow cytometry and ELISA respectively.

Results: TNF/afii9825 , LPS and fMLP stimulation resulted in significantly increased release of PMN HGF (755 ± 216, 484 ± 221 and 565 ± 278 pg/ml, respectively) compared to controls (118 ± 42 pg/ml). IL-8 had no effect. Total HGF release following cell lysis and Western blot suggests that HGF is released from intracellular stores. Recombinant human HGF did not alter PMN adhesion receptor expression and had no effect on PMN VEGF release.

Conclusions: This study demonstrates that pro-inflammatory mediators can stimulate HGF release from a PMN intracellular store and that activated PMN in addition to secreting VEGF have further angiogenic potential by releasing HGF.  2001 Harcourt Publishers Ltd

## INTRODUCTION

Hepatocyte growth factor or scatter factor (HGF/SF) is a pleiotropic cytokine that was initially identified in the serum of partially hepatectomized rats in the mid1980s. 1,2 Human HGF has now been fully purified and is a basic heparin-binding glycoprotein consisting of a 69 000 MW /afii9825 subunit and a 34 000 MW /afii9826 subunit. 3 The receptor is a cmet proto-oncogene product and is a transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor. 4

HGF is the most potent stimulator of DNA synthesis in hepatocytes in primary culture. 5 It is a powerful motogen for epithelial cells. 6-8 Due to its ability to 'scatter' tightly growing cell colonies, HGF is also named scatter factor. Furthermore. HGF stimulates the proliferation and migration of endothelial cells in vitro 9 and

has been shown to be angiogenic in vivo. 10 Angiogenesis is the process of formation of new blood vessels from preexisting blood vessels. This process is fundamental to many normal physiological processes, including wound healing and inflammation, and also plays an important role in solid tumour growth and metastasis. 11,12 These angiogenic properties exhibited by HGF, coupled with its more well-known effects on stimulating motility, proliferation and morphogenesis of epithelia, may implicate HGF as an important cytokine in the growth and development of tumours and their metastases.

A number of cell types produce HGF including fibroblasts, 6 endothelial cells, 13 vascular smooth muscle cells, 13 Kupffer cells 14 and certain tumour cells. 15-17 The neutrophil or polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) can also secrete a number of angiogenic cytokines or growth factors. To date, HGF production at protein level by PMN has not been investigated.

We wished to investigate the potential of the neutrophil to release other pro-angiogenic cytokines and hence looked at the effect of inflammatory mediators,

lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or endotoxin and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF/afii9825 ) and the chemo-attractants formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) and interleukin-8 (IL-8) on PMN HGF release. LPS is a bacterial cell wall product derived from most gram negative and some Gram-positive bacteria. 18 It is a potent inflammatory mediator. TNF/afii9825 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that derives its name from its ability to induce necrosis in experimental animal tumours. It is produced primarily by mononuclear phagocytes in response to LPS. 19 fMPL is a bacterial chemotactic peptide and the PMN expresses the fMLP receptor. 20

We have previously demonstrated that the PMN is directly angiogenic by releasing a potent cytokine, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which stimulates endothelial cell proliferation and tubule formation. 21 Two other recent studies have demonstrated HGF inducing upregulation of VEGF expression at mRNA and protein level by cultured keratinocytes 22 and human glioma cells 23 respectively. We therefore wished to examine the indirect effect of HGF on angiogenesis by examining the effect of HGF on PMN VEGF release.

PMN can facilitate tumour cell transmigration across vascular endothelium 24 and hence aid tumour invasion and metastasis. Adhesion molecules play a pivotal role in the interactions between leukocytes and tissues, including endothelial cells and extracellular matrix proteins. 25 HGF has been shown to induce ligand binding activity in functionally inactive /afii9825 v /afii9826 3 integrins in normal epithelial cells. 26 Integrins mediate cell to cell and cell to extracellular matrix adhesions. CD11a, CD11b and CD 18 are the predominant integrins or adhesion receptors found in PMN. We hypothesized that HGF could stimulate the expression of PMN adhesion receptors CD11a, CD11b, and CD 18.

## MATERIALS AND METHODS

## Reagents

RPMI 1640, Medium 199, phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) without Ca 2 + and Mg 2 + , fetal calf serum (FCS), penicillin, streptomycin sulphate, fungizone, glutamine and 0.05% trypsin-0.02% EDTA solution were purchased from GibcoBRL (Paisley, Scotland, UK). Two per cent gelatin, Tris, SDS, glycerol, mercaptoethanol, bromophenol blue, Percoll, Dextran, LPS ( Escherichia coli O55:B5), and heparin were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO, USA). Ficoll-Paque was obtained from Pharmacia (Uppsala, Sweden). TNF/afii9825 , IL-8 and goat antihuman HGF antibody were from R&amp;D Systems (Minneapolis, MN, USA). Mouse antihuman CD11a, CD11b, CD18 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were purchased from Becton Dickinson (Mountainview, CA, USA).

## Neutrophil isolation and culture

Whole venous blood was collected from healthy adult volunteers using lithium heparin as an anticoagulant. The PMN were isolated using Dextran sedimentation (6% Dextran in 0.9% sodium chloride) followed by Ficoll-Paque gradient centrifugation. Contaminating erythrocytes were removed by centrifugation through an 81% isotonic Percoll gradient. The granulocyte layer at the interface was collected, washed in RPMI 1640 and resuspended in complete RPMI 1640 containing 10% FCS, penicillin (100 U/ml), streptomycin sulphate (100 /afii9839 g/ ml), fungizone (0.25 /afii9839 g/ml) and 2 mM glutamine. PMN were counted and cell viability as determined by trypan blue exclusion was &gt;98%. Cell purity was &gt;97% as determined by Rapi-Diff II (DiaCheM, Lancashire, UK) staining on cytocentrifuged samples.

PMN (1 × 10 7 cells/ml) were then cultured in 24-well plates (Falcon, Lincoln Park, NJ, USA) (3 × 10 6 cells/well) in the presence of TNF/afii9825 (5, 25, 50 ng/ml), LPS (10, 50, 100 ng/ml), fMLP (50, 100, 500 nM), and IL-8 (50, 75, 100 ng/ml), and incubated at 37 C in 5% CO ° 2 conditions for different time points. Unstimulated PMN were used as controls. At 2 and 6 hour incubation time points, the supernatants were harvested from PMN cultures and stored at -80 C for further HGF quantification. °

## Enzyme immunoassay for HGF

HGF was assayed using a commercially available ELISA Kit (R&amp;D Systems) on a Microtitre Plate Reader (Dynex Technologies Inc., Chantilly, VA, USA) according to the manufacturer's recommended protocol. The sensitivity of this ELISA kit was less than 40 pg/ml. Concentrations of HGF in the samples were calculated by reading off the HGF standard curve.

## Western blot analysis for HGF protein

PMN (total cell no. per group = × 1 10 7 ) were incubated with either culture medium alone as the control group, or with TNF/afii9825 (5 ng/ml) or with LPS (10 ng/ml) for 2 hours at 37 C in 5% CO2 ° conditions. The PMN were then lysed using liquid nitrogen freeze thaw techiques. The supernatant was then harvested following centrifugation at 4500 rpm at 4 C for 20 min. ° Protein concentrations in the supernatant were quantified using a micro BCA protein assay reagent kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA). The proteins were denatured at 100 C for ° 10 min in loading buffer (60 mM Tris-HCL, 2.5% SDS, 10% glycerol, 5% mercaptoethanol, 0.01% bromophenol blue). Aliquots containing equal amounts of proteins from each sample were electrophoresed on a 12% SDS polyacrylamide gel. Separated proteins were blotted to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher &amp; Schuell, Dassel, Germany) and blocked with 6% skimmed milk powder

in PBS/0.05% Tween. After the primary goat anti-human HGF Ab (R&amp;D systems) and the secondary alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-goat IgG (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) were incubated with the membranes, the protein was visualized using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3indolyl-phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium (BCIP/NBT) (Promega).

Following incubation of human PMN with rfHGF (1, 10, 100 mg/ml) for 1 and 2 hours respectively at 37 C in 5% ° CO2-conditions, CD11a, CD11b, CD18 expression was assessed by addition of 10 /afii9839 l of FITC-conjugated antiLFA-1 /afii9825 (anti-CD11a), phyco-erytrin-conjugated antiLEU-15 (anti-CD11b), and FITC-conjugated anti-LFA-1 /afii9826

FITC- and phycoerythrinconjugated isotype immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 and IgG2a mAbs were used as negative controls. After incubation at 4 C for ° 30 min, PMN CD11a, CD11b, and CD18 expression was measured on a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson) for detecting the log of the mean

PMN were lysed using liquid nitrogen freeze/thaw technique as described in the 'Materials and Methods'. Total HGF concentration in the PMN was then quantified using ELISA. Total HGF (mean total HGF release = 1963 ± 318 pg/ml, n = 5) was greater than twice the maximum mean level released by PMN following LPS

channel fluorescence intensity with an acquisition of FL 1 and FL 2, respectively.

## Enzyme immunoassay for VEGF

PMN (1 × 10 7 cells/ml) were cultured in 24-well plates (Falcon, Lincoln Park, NJ, USA) (3 × 10 6 cells/well) in the presence of rhHGF (0, 10, 100, 500 ng/ml) and incubated at 37 C in 5% CO2 ° conditions for different time points. (1 × phosphate buffered saline (PBS) was used as a control). At 2 and 6 hour incubation time points, the supernatants were harvested from PMN cultures and VEGF was assayed using a commercially available ELISA Kit (R&amp;D Systems) on a Microtitre Plate Reader (Dynex Technologies Inc., Chantilly, VA, USA) according to the manufacturer's recommended protocol. The sensitivity of this ELISA kit was less than 5.0 pg/ml. Concentrations of VEGF in the samples were calculated by reading off the VEGF standard curve.

## Total HGF concentration

PMN(1 × 10 7 cells/ml) were collected in Eppendorf tubes (3 × 10 6 cells/tube) and placed in liquid nitrogen for 30 min, followed by thawing at 4 C ° for 2 hours as described previously. 27 This freeze/thaw cycle was repeated for a total of three times. One hundred percent lysis was confirmed by light microscopy. The supernatant was then harvested following centrifugation at 4500 rpm at 4 ° C for 20 min. HGF was then assayed using ELISA.

## Statistical analysis

All data are presented as the mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). Statistical analysis was performed using ANOVA. Differences were judged statistically when the P -value was less than 0.05.

## RESULTS

LPS, TNF/afii9825 and fMLP stimulation resulted in significantly increased release of PMN HGF compared to controls. As shown in Fig. 1(A and B), Fig. 2(A and B) and Fig. 3(A and B), stimulated PMN can release HGF following 2 and 6 hour incubation times. Maximal HGF release was demonstrated after stimulation with 5 ng/ml of TNF/afii9825 . Higher doses of TNF/afii9825 would appear to result in lower releases of HGF, but these are not significant. At the concentrations of IL-8 we studied, no effect on HGF release could be demonstrated (Fig. 4(A and B)).

and TNF/afii9825 stimulation (706 ± 191 and 889 ± 360 pg/ml, respectively) (Fig. 5A).

HGF protein expression in the PMN was investigated using Western blot. The protein expression in control PMN (unstimulated), LPS stimulated and TNF/afii9825 stimulated PMN was demonstrated. There appeared to be no difference in the level of expression between the unstimulated and stimulated groups as shown in Fig. 5(B).

(B) HGF protein was detected in PMN isolated from two donors using Western blot analysis. Protein bands in the 103 kDa range corresponding to HGF were detected in control PMN, LPS stimulated and TNF/afii9825 stimulated PMN.

Stimulation of PMN with recombinant human HGF did not increase PMN release of VEGF following incubation of the PMN with varying concentrations of rhHGF for both 2 and 6 hour timepoints, as demonstrated in Fig. 6(A and B).

Similarly, no effect on PMN adhesion receptor expression of CD 11a, CD 11b, and CD 18 could be demonstrated following incubation of PMN with recombinant human HGF, as shown in Fig. 7(A, B and C).

## DISCUSSION

We demonstrate that endotoxin or LPS, TNF/afii9825 and fMLP stimulate the PMN to release HGF. Two previous studies did show HGF expression within the PMN. Mine et al. 28 described HGF within the PMN using

immunohistochemical techniques in inflamed skin lesions from one single patient suffering from Bechet's disease. Sagaguchi et al. 29 again using immunohistochemical staining, described HGF as being present in PMN within normal and diseased human livers. We demonstrate, for the first time, that PMN can release HGF following stimulation with a number of inflammatory mediators.

rh HGF Concentration (ng/ml)

The levels of HGF released from PMN following TNF/afii9825 stimulation (755 ± 216 pg/ml) and LPS stimulation (484 ± 221 pg/ml) equate to serum HGF levels found in surgical patients after partial hepatectomies. 30,31

our work does not reveal any change in the level of PMN adhesion receptor expression, HGF would appear to play a pivotal role in integrin-mediated adhesion and transmigration of neutrophils.

IL-8 is another PMN chemo-attractant, which induces PMN to transmigrate across the endothelial cell. PMN infiltration into inflamed sites is one of the hallmarks of acute inflammation. Locally produced IL-8 plays a major role in recruiting and activating PMN. 32 We could not demonstrate an IL-8 induced PMN HGF release at the concentrations we studied.

Next, we wished to ascertain if PMN synthesize HGF or whether HGF is released from a pre-synthesized intracellular pool. Lysed PMN released more than double the total HGF concentration compared to maximal HGF release following LPS and TNF/afii9825 stimulation. Western blot was used to detect HGF protein expression within the PMN and compare the level of HGF expression between unstimulated PMN and LPS and TNF/afii9825 stimulated PMN. There appeared to be no difference in this expression between the three groups. These results would indicate that HGF is stored in an intracellular pool awaiting the appropriate stimulation for release.

Previous studies have illustrated the direct angiogenic effect of HGF both in vitro and in vivo . We wished to examine an indirect effect of HGF on angiogenesis by studying the effect of recombinant human HGF (rhHGF) on PMN VEGF release. We could not demonstrate upregulation of PMN VEGF release following stimulation with 10, 100 and 500 ng/ml rhHGF. Two recent studies have documented upregulation of VEGF in human epidermal keratinocytes 22 and human glioma cells. 23 Both keratinocytes and the human glioma cells studied expressed the HGF cmet proto-oncogene receptor. To date, there are no reports of such a receptor on the PMN. However, HGF has been shown to prime PMN, 33 but the mechanism by which HGF acts on the PMN has not been elucidated as yet.

Finally, we could not detect any upregulation of PMN adhesion receptor molecules CD 11a, CD 11b, and CD 18, following incubation of PMN with rhHGF. PMN leave the circulation via endothelial cell transmigration and hence accumulate in host tissues. PMN transmigration is initiated by interactions between adhesion molecules on the PMN and adhesion molecules on the endothelial cells. PMN can also facilitate tumour cell transmigration across endothelial cells and could therefore potentiate tumour spread. Three families of adhesion molecules are known to be involved in interactions between circulating leukocytes and tissues, the immunoglobulin, the selectin and the integrin families. CD 11a, CD 11b, and CD 18 are the predominant integrins on all leukocytes. A recent study by Mine et al. 28 demonstrated rhHGF could induce an activated form of CD11a/18 without changing the level of expression of the conventional CD11a/18 adhesion receptor on PMN. This paper also illustrated that HGF could induce PMN adhesion to endothelial cells. Although

These findings that PMN have further angiogenic potential by releasing HGF in addition to other angiogenic cytokines, including VEGF, has important implications in physiological and pathological processes where PMN play a role, for example in wound healing, in inflammatory conditions, and even in the role of promoting the growth of residual dormant tumour cells by releasing proangiogenic cytokines into the surrounding stroma after the PMN has transmigrated across the endothelium. It has been shown in a murine model of colon carcinoma, that the production of pro-angiogenic cytokines and microvessel density correlate with the number of infiltrating leukocytes. 34 Wu et al. 35 have demonstrated that PMN have the ability to augment tumour cell extravasation via PMN-induced transmigration of tumour cells across endothelial cell monolayers. In addition, the appearance of PMN and macrophages at the sites of neoplastic growth is part of the inflammatory reaction usually provoked by tumours. 36 Although the precise role of PMN in tumour growth and metastasis remains unclear, PMN are capable of secreting a number of angiogenic cytokines, which may promote tumour microvascular development.

It has been shown that recombinant human HGF and recombinant human VEGF demonstrate additive effects on endothelial proliferation and synergistic effects on endothelial cell migration. 37 The PMN can release both these cytokines and the consequence of such combined effects could be expected to be a potent stimulus for PMN directed angiogenesis in vivo.
