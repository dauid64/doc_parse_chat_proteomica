As  a  crucial  component  of  the  innate  immune  system,  neutrophils  are  engaged  in  the  initial inflammatory  response  following  cardiovascular  injury,  which  can  therefore  induce  subsequent damage and promote recovery. Neutrophils exert their functional effects in tissues through different mechanisms, including the activation of neutrophils, and the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). Once activated, neutrophils are recruited to the site of injury, releasing inflammatory mediators and cytokines. The main mechanisms correlated with neutrophil activity are discussed in this study. Meanwhile, the potential new therapeutic targets may also be proposed. In the current review, we systematically summarize the diverse phenotypes of neutrophils in the disease regulatory mechanisms,  different  modes  of  cell  death,  and  concentrate  on  the  relevance  of  neutrophils  to various CVDs, especially atherosclerosis (AS), acute myocardial infarction, heart failure (HF), atrial fibrillation,  ischemia-reperfusion  injury,  and  viral  myocarditis.  Finally,  the  preclinical/clinical translational significance of neutrophil-targeted strategies is also emphasized. Keyword: Neutrophils; Cardiovascular diseases; Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs); Inflammation; 1 Introduction Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are currently considered to be chronic inflammatory diseases involving multiple factors, with approximately 50% of annual deaths worldwide being attributed to CVDs  [1] .  During  the  past  few  years,  there  has  been  a  renewed  focus  on  innate  immunology. Neutrophils, which are also known as polymorphonuclear (PMN) leukocytes, are the most abundant kind of immune cells in the innate immune system [2] , serving as a vital defense tool for the immune system against pathogens. For a long time, neutrophils have been considered the final effector cells of acute inflammatory responses, playing a leading role in the clearance of extracellular pathogens. Nevertheless, recent evidence has expanded the roles of neutrophils [3, 4]  , which can respond to various signals, affect and regulate inflammation and the immune system by producing a variety of cytokines and other inflammatory factors  [5, 6] . Early studies have concentrated on the impact of neutrophils on rheumatic immunity, cancer, sepsis, and etc., with only limited understanding of its role in cardiovascular inflammation. With the deepening of research, the significance of neutrophils in the development of CVDs has gradually been investigated. Neutrophils can be widely involved in  the  occurrence  and  development  of  CVDs,  exacerbating  the  progression  of  various  CVDs including  AS,  myocardial  infarction,  hypertension,  and  aortic  aneurysm/dissection [7] .  With  the development and use of drugs targeting inflammatory cytokines, the concept of reducing vascular events by inhibiting inflammation has been extensively accepted [8] . This overview concentrated on the basic principles of neutrophil biology associated with cardiovascular pathophysiology and its Preprint not peer reviewed

significance in CVDs. 2. Formation, Markers, and Cardiac Biological Functions of Neutrophils 2.1 Formation of Neutrophils Neutrophils  are  the  most  abundant  type  of  leukocytes,  constituting  the  crucial  first  line  of defense against infections [9] . They are originated from hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in the bone marrow and undergo different stages of differentiation under the regulation of granulocyte colonystimulating factor (G-CSF). These stages include the progression from multipotent progenitor cells (HPCs),  through  myeloid  lineage-committed  progenitors,  to  common  myeloid  progenitor  cells (CMPs), and granulocyte-monocyte progenitor cells (GMPs). Then, GMPs enter the mitotic pool, where they rapidly divide and differentiate into promyelocytes, myelocytes, subsequently into late promyelocytes, band neutrophils, and finally into segmented nuclear neutrophils. Mature segmented nuclear neutrophils are released into the bloodstream through the bone marrow-blood barrier, ready to respond  to signals of inflammation  or  infection [3] . The  different stages of neutrophil differentiation  are  classified  based  on  morphological  characteristics  including  cell  size,  nuclear condensation, expression of cellular markers, differentiation traits, and protein content. 2.2 Heterogeneity and Markers of Neutrophils The diverse functional responses of neutrophils are triggered by the changes in transcriptional activation and the expression or activity of surface molecules. These phenotypic variations are often detectable only in a subset of neutrophils, indicating a significant heterogeneity among neutrophils [10] .  Therefore,  the  heterogeneity  of  neutrophils  in  different  states  can  be  observed through the differential expression of certain markers( Figure 1 ). CD33, CD15, CD11b, CD16, and CD10 are the signature molecules of immature differentiated neutrophils  [11-13] . Phenotypes such as CD16hi, CXCR2 hi , CXCR4 low , and CD62L hi  are characteristics of mature circulating neutrophils  [14] . The down-regulation of the chemokine receptor 4 (CXC chemokine receptor 4, CXCR4) is a vital event  in  the  mobilization  of  neutrophils  from  the  bone  marrow [15] ,  and  chemokines  (including CXCL8, CXCL1, CXCL2, and CXCL5) can stimulate the release of neutrophils into the circulation and  their  migration  to  inflammatory  sites  via  CXCR2  signaling,  where  they  adhere  to  the endothelium  [16-19] . Neutrophil  activation  is  triggered  by  signals  from  the  sites  of  inflammation  or  infection, initiating  the  transendothelial  migration  of  neutrophils  into  peripheral  tissues  across  the  blood vessels. After interacting with endothelial selectins and chemokines, neutrophils secrete vesicles that  fuse  with  the  surface  membrane,  exposing  proteins  contained  in  these  vesicles.  Then,  the activated  neutrophils  on  the  endothelial  cells  rapidly  up-regulate  CD11b  and  CD18,  therefore promoting firm adhesion [3] . The activation of neutrophils also results in an increase in the expression of CD66b, which can be mobilized from intracellular granules to the cell membrane in the process of degranulation  [20]  . The CD177 glycoprotein (NB1) is expressed exclusively on the surface of human  neutrophils  and  controls  transendothelial  transport  through  interaction  with  platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule  [21]  . Aging  neutrophils,  in  addition  to  being  smaller  in  size  and  containing  fewer  granules [22] , exhibit  the  enhanced  pro-inflammatory  activity  but  have  impaired  adhesion  and  phagocytic functions [23,  24] . The  general  phenotype  of  'aged  neutrophils'  includes  CXCR2 low ,  CXCR4 hi , CD62L low , CD11b hi , CD11c hi  and CD47 low[25-29] . Chemokine CXC motif ligand 12 (CXCL12) and its receptor CXCR4 are widely expressed in different cells in human bone marrow, heart, and other tissues [30] .  CXCR4 is generally considered to be the sole specific receptor for CXCL12, and the Preprint not peer reviewed

multi-pathway  signaling  of  CXCR4  can  mediate  different  biological  movements  and  responses including cell migration, chemotaxis, proliferation, anti-apoptosis, homing, and adhesion [31] . The retention and release of neutrophils in the bone marrow are controlled by the synergistic action of the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis  [26, 32] . In the peripheral blood, aged neutrophils with increased CXCR4 expression home to the bone marrow through the chemokine CXCL12 pathway, and once in the bone marrow, CD62L low  neutrophils migrate towards macrophages, causing the clearance of these neutrophils from the bloodstream [26-28, 30] . Moreover, the reduced expression of the 'do not eat me' molecule CD47 can enhance the recognition and phagocytic action of macrophages [25, 29] . Other markers associated with aged neutrophils include CD45, CD24, ICAM-1 and TLR4  [33-35] . In addition to the bloodstream, under normal conditions, neutrophils can also migrate to various tissues and spontaneously change their phenotype. For instance, the spleen exhibits neutrophils with the phenotypeCD62L low CD11b hi ICAM1 hi   [36]  , and the neutrophils located in the marginal zone of the human spleen are referred to as 'neutrophil B cell helpers' (NBH cells) [37]  . This subpopulation (CD15int/lo, CD16int/low, and CD11b hi ) can release B cell-stimulating molecules, including B cellactivating  factor  (BAFF)  and  CD40  ligand  (CD40L),  promoting  the  secretion  of  IgM  and  IgG. Prostates  express  neutrophils  with  the  phenotype  CD11b + Ly6G + Ly6C lo ,  possessing  stronger immunosuppressive  activity [38] .  Currently,  our  understanding  of  how  neutrophils  change  into various phenotypes in different tissues and what roles they play is still limited, and there is a vast unknown territory awaiting our continued exploration. After  migrating  to  tissues,  neutrophils  can  return  to  the  bloodstream,  a  process  known  as reverse transendothelial migration (rTEM). Markers associated with reverse migrating neutrophils include  CD18,  ICAM1 [39] ,  CXCR4 low[40] ,  and  neutrophil  elastase  (ELANE),  which  degrade junctional adhesion molecule-C (JAM-C)  [41] . This allows them to recirculate back into the blood [42] . CD18 can interact with endothelial cell surface molecules (including binding to ICAM-1) [43, 44] , and the homing of neutrophils to the bone marrow is mediated by CXCR4 [45]  . Neutrophil rTEM regulates the proliferation of T cells and B cells, as well as NET formation, and induces systemic inflammation and interaction with the immune system by clearing excess neutrophils from local tissues [46] . Therefore, targeting neutrophil rTEM may offer a novel therapeutic strategy for resolving inflammation. Figure  1  Partial  markers  of  neutrophils. illustrates  the  heterogeneity  of  neutrophils  in different states, including the markers of immature, mature, and activated neutrophils in the bone marrow (A), the markers of positive migration and aging in the bloodstream (B), and the markers of migration to various tissues and organs in the human body (C).

2.3 Cardiac Biological Functions of Neutrophils 2.3.1 Generation and Chemotaxis Neutrophils are a vital component of the innate immune system. Apart from phagocytosing and destroying invading microbial pathogens and releasing antimicrobial granules, they can also exert their functional effects in tissues through various mechanisms, including the production and release of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), causing damage and destruction of pathogens [47-49]  . Healthy adults need to produce 10^11 neutrophils daily, and mice require 10^7 [50]  . Under homeostatic conditions, the number of mature neutrophils remains relatively stable and can be released into circulation from the bone marrow following a circadian rhythm through the mutual regulation of CXCR2/CXCR4 and the interaction with CXCL1 and CXCL2 produced by endothelial cells and megakaryocytes  [51-53]  . However, in acute inflammation and emergency situations including myocardial infarction, the production of neutrophils can be accelerated  and  maintained  by  proliferative  signals  from  cells  subjected  to  ischemic  injury  or exposed to ischemic damage, and their numbers can rapidly increase in circulation [54] . On the one hand, they can phagocytose dead cells and cellular debris, clearing sterile inflammation; on the other hand, they can also send signals to recruit monocytes, promoting the phagocytosis of apoptotic or necrotic  neutrophils [55] .  Meanwhile,  after  recognizing  microbes  and/or  inflammatory  stimuli, neutrophils can immediately migrate from circulating blood to the site of inflammation through an adhesion/migration  cascade,  exerting  their  effector  functions  and  responding  to  damage  by capturing  and  eliminating  pathogens  through  phagocytosis,  producing  ROS,  degranulation, secreting vesicles, and forming NETs [56] . The activated neutrophils can up-regulate OXPHOS genes, relying on mitochondrial respiration to produce sufficient ATP to ensure the continuation of cell migration and chemotaxis  [57, 58] . 2.3.2 Pro-inflammatory and Repair Functions Neutrophils exhibit different phenotypes and functions at various stages of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory processes. After cardiac injury, neutrophils follow a temporal polarization pattern,  transitioning  from  a  pro-inflammatory  phenotype  (sometimes  referred  to  as  "N1")  to  a reparative phenotype (sometimes referred to as "N2"). In the initial phase of myocardial infarction, neutrophils  are  activated  by  recognizing  pathogen-associated  molecular  patterns  (PAMPs)  or damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) via pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), causing polarization into N1 type neutrophils that promote their pro-inflammatory functions [7, 59]  . On the first day, N1 type neutrophils produce and release pro-inflammatory mediators, including cytokines (such as TNF-α, IL-1β) and  chemokines (like CCL3), further recruiting other immune cells  [60] . Simultaneously, polarization also occurs in the peripheral blood and bone marrow of myocardial infarction models, which may involve the reverse transport of neutrophils, stimulating granulopoiesis and spreading inflammation [61] . During the resolution of inflammation and tissue repair, N2 type neutrophils are dominant [62, 63] , expressing anti-inflammatory markers from the 5 th to the 7 th day of injury, which assists in the resolution of inflammation and the clearance of apoptotic myocardial cells [64] . Interestingly, neutrophils also promote cardiac repair through the production of matrix proteins required for fibrotic scar formation (including fibronectin and fibrinogen) and by secreting MMP9 to promote angiogenic responses [65] . 2.3.3 Immune Regulation Neutrophils can also interact with various immune cells, which include dendritic cells, T cells, and B cells, and modulate their functions [66] . For instance, conventional neutrophils in the marginal Preprint not peer reviewed

zone, known as NBH cells, are thought to facilitate B cell proliferation and antibody production [37] . The interaction between neutrophils and dendritic cells can influence the maturation and antigenpresenting  capacity  of  dendritic  cells,  thereby  affecting  the  activation  and  differentiation  of  T cells [67] .  Neutrophils  are  also  capable  of  expressing  and  secreting  molecules  that  affect  T  cell functions, such as arginase 1 and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), which can hinder T cell proliferation and activation, thus regulating T cell-mediated immune responses to some extent [68] . These interactions suggest that neutrophils may exert a more complex role in forming and regulating adaptive immune responses than previously thought. 3.Neutrophil Death Mechanisms Neutrophils can undergo various modes of death, such as apoptosis, NETosis, pyroptosis, and ferroptosis( Figure  2 ).  Understanding  the  diverse  death  mechanisms  of  neutrophils  can  further elucidate the critical points at which neutrophils are involved in the pathogenesis of CVDs. Figure 2 Mechanisms of Neutrophil Death. provides an overview of the four common modes of neutrophil death: apoptosis, NETosis, pyroptosis, and ferroptosis. At sites of cardiac injury, neutrophil death can be triggered by a variety of factors, including pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), bacteria, and viruses. Different modes of death can be induced through distinct pathways and are interrelated. (Created using Figdraw) 3.1 Apoptosis in Neutrophils The  maturation  of  neutrophils  reduces  the  transcription  and  translation  rates,  thereby decreasing the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins while retaining that of pro-apoptotic effector proteins [69] .  Under normal conditions, neutrophils enter the circulation and migrate to peripheral tissues after maturation. The half-life of circulating neutrophils is short. Once they have completed their  physiological  functions  in  the  tissues  (such  as  destroying  the  invading  organisms),  they undergo spontaneous apoptosis, a form of programmed cell death. This form of cell death maintains the integrity of the neutrophil membrane, preventing the release of intracellular toxic substances, and limiting their destructive capacity to surrounding tissues [70, 71] . It is crucial for maintaining the balance of circulating neutrophil numbers and the pro-inflammatory/anti-inflammatory balance in the body [50] . At inflammatory sites, apoptosis can be triggered by cytokines, PAMPs, DAMPs, and environmental factors [72, 73]  . Apoptosis of neutrophils is initiated through two distinct signaling pathways,  namely,  the  intrinsic  and  extrinsic  pathways.  The  extrinsic  apoptosis  pathway  in neutrophils depends on ROS produced by NADPH oxidase [74]  , and its mechanism may be related to the ability of ROS to directly change the activity of intracellular signaling pathways involved in neutrophil  death/survival,  such  as  NF-kB  and  MAPK [75,  76]   .  The  intrinsic  apoptosis  pathway  is Preprint not peer reviewed

mediated by mitochondria, which is featured with the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and the release of pro-apoptotic factors like cytochrome c into the cytosol [77, 78]  . 3.2NETosis The activated neutrophils produce and trigger a special form of cell death called NETosis when they generate and release NETs. NETosis is distinct from both apoptosis and necrosis and is entirely independent  of  the  action  of  caspases  involved  in  apoptosis.  At  first,  NETs  were  described  by Brinkmann  et  al.  in  2004 [79] and  are  the  extracellular  web-like  structures  released  by  activated neutrophils, which contain a variety of antimicrobial proteins including histones, neutrophil elastase (NE),  calprotectin  B  (also  known  as  S100A9),  and  myeloperoxidase  (MPO) [80] .  Although  the lifespan of neutrophils in circulation is only 6-12 hours  [50] , the function of released NETs can last for several days to further exert their effects. Neutrophils can be activated by recognition through Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), and complement receptors [81] , and they are stimulated by pathogenic microorganisms, activated platelets, specific cytokines (such as IL-8 and TNF-α), lipopolysaccharides (LPS), and other stimuli  [82] , finally activating the NADPH oxidase [83] . The activated NADPH oxidase converts oxygen into superoxide for the production of H2O2, MPO, and ROS, and subsequently activates peptidylarginine deiminase 4 (PAD4)  [84] . PAD4 is mainly expressed in immune cells  [85]  and is a vital molecule in forming NETs. MPO converts hydrogen peroxide into hypochlorous acid (HOCl), which activates NE. NE, in turn, degrades the cytoskeleton and dismantles the nuclear membrane, allowing the expelling and functioning of NETs. Additionally, some viruses, including influenza A, HIV-1, and encephalomyocarditis virus, can also trigger the formation of NETs  [86-88]  , but not all pathways that result in the formation of NETs can result in neutrophil death. Currently, two different forms of NETosis have been identified, including the classical or suicidal NETosis (which lead to cell death through the formation of NETs with nuclear  membrane rupture) and "vital NETosis" or non-suicidal NETosis (which maintains cell viability and a range of effector functions, and is mediated by vesicles) [89, 90] . Non-suicidal NETosis is thought to play a more significant role in regulating pathogen infection. Although NETs are vital effectors in clearing bacterial infections and sterile inflammation, they can also cause tissue damage [91-93] . S100A8/A9, belonging to the S100 family of calcium-binding proteins, exerts a certain effect on various inflammatory diseases [94] . When NETs are generated, S100A8/A9 can be released from the  cytoplasm  of  neutrophils,  activating  surrounding  immune  cells  and  thus  amplifying  the inflammatory response [95] . Therefore, inhibiting the overactivation of the innate immune system remains a key therapeutic approach. 3.3 Pyroptosis of Neutrophils Pyroptosis is a form of regulated cell death mediated by the Gasdermin family of proteins, which is characterized  by  the  formation  of  membrane  pores,  causing  cell  swelling  and  rupture, release of inflammatory mediators, and promotion of inflammatory responses [96] . Pyroptosis has been identified as another mode of regulated cell death that can occur in mature neutrophils, and it is triggered by various signaling pathways, including the canonical (caspase-1 dependent) [NODlike receptor family pyrin domain containing 3, NLRP3] and non-canonical (caspase-11 dependent) inflammasomes [such as Absent in Melanoma 2, AIM2], death receptors (RIPK1 and caspase-8), and granule serine proteases (ELANE) [97] . Neutrophils can express Gasdermin D (GSDMD) and maintain their ability to release IL-1β (a pro-inflammatory cytokine) through a GSDMD-dependent pathway, thereby promoting inflammatory responses and immune responses without cell death [98] . As a key molecule in regulating cell pyroptotic necrosis, the absence of GSDMD reduces the degree Preprint not peer reviewed

of  myocardial  fibrosis  after  myocardial  infarction,  and  decreases IL-1β released  by  infiltrating myeloid cells in the heart, thus playing a cardioprotective role [96] . This result indicates that GSDMD is a potential target for improving ventricular remodeling and reducing heart failure (HF) after AMI. Moreover, NETosis may be related to the pyroptosis of neutrophils [98] . The NLRP3 inflammasome can recognize PAMPs and DAMPs, and the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome can stimulate NETosis, further amplifying the inflammatory response [99] . The GSDMD inhibitor Disulfiram (DSF) can  inhibit  the  release  of  NETs [100] ,  suggesting  that  different  forms  of  neutrophil  death  are interconnected and collectively affect the body's immune function. 3.4 Ferroptosis of Neutrophils Ferroptosis, first proposed by Stockwell  [101] , is a novel form of regulatory cell death caused by  iron  overload  and  the  accumulation  of  lipid  ROS,  accompanied  by  DAMPs.  It  can  mediate inflammation and has been proven to be related with the pathogenesis of many diseases. There is growing  evidence  suggesting  that  the  pathogenesis  of  CVDs  is  related  to  ferroptosis,  and  the ferroptosis of neutrophils has become a hot topic of research in recent years, and the regulation of ferroptosis also provides new opportunities for the treatment of CVDs. Although currently, elevated lipid  ROS  and  ferroptosis  of  PMNs  have  only  been  observed  in  the  serum  of  systemic  lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients  [102] , there have been no reports on the ferroptosis of neutrophils in CVDs. However, as this form of cell death is further explored in other diseases, it may also provide insights for the study on the mechanisms of neutrophil ferroptosis in CVDs. 4. Neutrophils and CVDs 4.1 Neutrophils and Atherosclerosis (AS) The development of AS relies on a chronic inflammatory process driven by lipids, from the initial stage of vulnerable atherosclerotic plaques to their eventual rupture, where neutrophils play a key pathophysiological role. Megen et al. reported [103]  the presence of neutrophils and NETs in atherosclerotic lesions in mice and humans. Initially, hyperlipidemia can induce neutrophilia  [104] , and neutrophils can damage endothelial function by mediating the deposition of granule proteins on endothelial  cells,  inducing  adhesion,  and  promoting  the  recruitment  of  monocytes,  thereby exacerbating the local response in the atherosclerotic process  [105]  . Meanwhile, activated mast cells present in the intima and perivascular tissue of atherosclerotic plaques can release chemokines (such as CXCL1), inducing further recruitment of neutrophils to the inflammatory site  [106]  . In AS mouse models,  sterile  inflammation  is  also  shown  to  drive  cytokine  production,  and  neutrophils,  once activated, initiate effector functions and release NETs  [107] . Research by Knight et al.  [108]  showed that chloromethyl ketone inhibited PAD4, thereby reducing the formation of NETs and the lesion area of atherosclerotic plaques, further suggesting the important role of NETs in AS. Studies have also  reported [109] that  human  neutrophil  granules  express  bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein (BPI), which can respond to inflammatory stress and may be involved in the processes of AS and atherosclerotic thrombosis. It can be seen that AS is not only a storage of lipids but also an inflammatory response accompanied by an immune response. Therefore, lipid-lowering therapy is the cornerstone of current AS treatment, but this is not enough to reduce residual cardiovascular risk, and targeted neutrophil therapy may become a future direction of development. 4.2 Neutrophils and Acute Myocardial Infarction Acute myocardial infarction refers to myocardial ischemic necrosis, where the coronary blood flow is dramatically reduced or interrupted in the case of the lesion, ultimately leading to myocardial ischemic necrosis. In myocardial infarction, neutrophils are involved in all aspects, including the Preprint not peer reviewed

activation  of  the  early  inflammatory  response,  myocardial  cell  necrosis,  and  the  later  stage  of myocardial scar repair. The neutrophil count is regarded as an independent prognostic factor for patients with ACS [110] . Neutrophils are present in the early vulnerable ruptured/eroded atherosclerotic plaques and are massively recruited in the late stage of plaque progression  [111] . After myocardial infarction, a large amount of DAMPs are produced by the damaged myocardial cells [112] ,  including  the  nuclei  of  myocardial  cells  (such  as  HMGB1),  cytoplasm  (such  as  RNA), extracellular  matrix  (such  as  fibronectin),  mitochondria  (such  as  mtDNA),  and  contractile components (myosin)  [113, 114] , which triggers the sterile inflammatory response after myocardial infarction and ultimately activates a complete innate immune signaling pathway  [115] . Numerous neutrophils  are  activated  and  immediately  initiate  a  series  of  processes,  including  neutrophil recruitment, adhesion, binding, and final migration and infiltration  [116] . The activated neutrophils can damage endothelial cells through apoptosis or by the production of proteases. Proteases can destroy the adhesion of endothelial cells to the vascular wall, causing endothelial cells to fall off, which thereby exposes the underlying connective tissue matrix, allows platelets to adhere to this site,  and  leads  to  thrombosis [117] .  In  the  meantime,  thrombin-activated  platelets  interact  with neutrophils at the site of plaque rupture, leading to local NETosis and the activation of tissue factor [118] .  After  myocardial  infarction,  neutrophils  can  also  release  S100A8/A9  in  the  infarction  area through NETosis, interact with Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 on naïve neutrophils, activate the NLRP3 inflammasome of the NOD-like receptor (NLR) family pyrin domain-containing 3, and amplify granule  production  through  IL-1  and  IL-18  dependent  signaling  pathways [119] , eventually promoting the development of myocardial fibrosis  [120] . Subsequently, the recruitment of neutrophils can  not  only  clear  cellular  debris  and  dead  cells,  but  also  produce  key  molecular  signals  for monocyte/macrophage reprogramming  [116] . Neutrophils release MMP8 and MMP9, degrading the extracellular  matrix.  The  inhibition  of  MMP-9  in  mice  can  reduce  left  ventricular  dilation  and collagen accumulation in the infarction area after coronary artery ligation  [121] , further proving that neutrophils are indispensable in adverse cardiac remodeling after myocardial infarction  [122] . 4.3 Neutrophils and Hypertension In  addition  to  neuro-humoral  regulatory  mechanisms,  immune-inflammatory  responses  exert  a critical role in the pathological cardiac remodeling caused by hypertension. Evidence has suggested that  the  innate  immune  system  has  a  vital  role  in  the  development  of  hypertension  since  the 1960s [123] .  Experiments  by  Morton  et  al. [124] showed  that  neutrophils  were  directly  involved  in controlling blood pressure. Neutrophils infiltrate the arteries, heart, and kidneys, potentially driving fibrosis  by  secreting  pro-oxidant,  pro-inflammatory,  and  profibrotic  molecules,  stimulating  the infiltration of other immune cells into tissues including blood vessels and the heart  [125] , and leading to  inflammation  and  fibrosis  related  to  hypertension.  In  patients  undergoing  hypertension  or  in animal models of hypertension, neutrophils isolated from peripheral blood exhibit high levels of ROS [126, 127] , enhancing their oxidative stress characteristics and triggering multiple processes like inflammation, proliferation, and fibrosis, which damage vascular function. Previous studies have suggested that an increased neutrophil count in hypertensive patients and an elevated neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR) are correlated with an increased risk of hypertension  [128] , and NLR is higher in non-dipper hypertensive patients. Additionally, some clinical studies have shown that  the  use  of  certain  antihypertensive  medications  can  reduce  the  NLR  in  patients  with hypertension. 4.4 Neutrophils and Atrial Fibrillation Preprint not peer reviewed

Atrial  fibrillation  (AF)  is  the  most  commonly  seen  clinical  arrhythmia.  Patients  with  AF typically exhibit an increased inflammatory signal activity  [129] . In both patients with AF and in angiotensin II-induced AF mouse models, increased infiltration of immune cells such as neutrophils, macrophages, and monocytes in the atrial tissue can be detected  [130-132] . Even in the absence of underlying structural heart disease, leukocytes can be found in the atrial tissue of patients with AF [133] . Lipid inflammatory mediators such as platelet-activating factor (PAF), which are synthesized by activated  neutrophils,  can  induce  atrial  and  ventricular  arrhythmias  as  well  as  repolarization abnormalities in isolated cardiomyocytes  [134] . The sustained rapid pacing can lead to the loss of myocardial cell structure, which provides a strong stimulus for the secretion of NETs. NETs can promote  apoptosis  in  cardiomyocytes  via  the  autophagy  pathway,  and  cause  swelling  of mitochondria  in  cardiomyocytes,  depolarization  of mitochondrial  membrane  potential,  and increased production of mitochondrial ROS [135] , resulting in an increased susceptibility to AF  [134] . In the in vivo experiments, the degradation of NETs by DNase I can reduce the duration of AF and improve fibrosis associated with AF, providing a new strategy for the treatment of AF  [135] . An elevated  NLR is not only seen in patients with AF accompanied by underlying structural heart disease and in patients undergoing paroxysmal AF, but can also act as a predictive marker for the recurrence of AF after cardiac conversion. 4.5 Neutrophils and HF Although the role of neutrophils as first responders in the acute phase of myocardial infarction to clear dead cells and promote the polarization of reparative macrophages is well recognized, their role in chronic ischemic HF remains unclear [136] . The relationship between neutrophils and HF is multifaceted,  involving  inflammation,  cardiac  remodeling,  and  immune  regulation.  Neutrophilic leukocytosis  and  sustained  activation  are  major  factors  that  determine  the  overly  activated inflammation in acute HF and the outcomes of long-term chronic HF  [62] . Studies have shown that in the HF mouse models, the depletion of neutrophils through antibody-mediated or genetic methods can halt the progression of HF, especially the left ventricular remodeling and fibrosis progression in the middle and late stages of HF  [136] , further indicating that neutrophils are a potential therapeutic target for lowering myocardial damage and preventing HF  [137, 138] . Hemodynamic changes in HF can induce a sterile inflammatory state  [139] . Early inflammatory responses include the migration of neutrophils and macrophages, production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines such as TNF-α, IL-1,  and IL-6 at different stages of HF  [140] , mediation of myocardial cell necrosis and exacerbation  of  adverse  cardiac  remodeling [141] ,  making  the  targeted  inhibition  of  neutrophilderived pro-inflammatory factors an active area of research for treating HF. Neutrophils may also directly  damage  cardiomyocytes  by  releasing  ROS  and  proteolytic  enzymes,  leading  to  cardiac dysfunction  [142] . The NLR also has predictive value in the severity, prognosis, and diagnosis of HF, with its increased level being associated with a poor prognosis in patients with HF  [143] . 4.6 Neutrophils and Myocardial Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury Reperfusion of ischemic myocardium is an absolute necessity to save the myocardial tissue from ultimate death. The activation of neutrophils and the accumulation of ROS are the important pathophysiological  mechanisms  that  mediate  myocardial  ischemia-reperfusion  injury  (MIRI). Within 24-48 h after myocardial reperfusion, neutrophils are the main infiltrating cells [144] , which can exacerbate myocardial damage by mediating inflammatory responses and affecting microcirculatory  blood  flow.  The  primary  mechanism  involves  the  activation  of  nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase (respiratory burst), releasing a large amount of Preprint not peer reviewed

ROS [145] . ROS can directly react with lipids, proteins, and DNA, generating cellular damage and inducing the release of  cytokines  and  chemokines  that  are  partially  mediated  by NF-κB. In  the myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (MI/R) model, blocking NF-κB can reduce myocardial injury and left ventricular remodeling [146] . DAMPs released during MI/R can activate the complement cascade, which up-regulates adhesion molecules on endothelial cells to promote neutrophil migration [147] . PDE4B  plays  a  key  role  in  MIRI  by  mediating  neutrophilic  inflammatory  responses  and microcirculatory disturbances. Blocking PDE4B can not only reduce myocardial cell death, but also improve coronary microvascular obstruction, which provides the dual cardiac protection [148] , and offers a novel perspective for preventing and treating MIRI. The development of subtype-selective PDE4B inhibitors or the repurposing of existing PDE drugs may become a new cardiac protective agent for patients with acute myocardial infarction during reperfusion. 4.7 Neutrophils and Myocarditis Myocarditis  is  a  non-ischemic  myocardial  inflammatory  disease,  which  can  be  caused  by viruses and various autoimmune diseases. There are many mechanisms underlying its pathogenesis, with the main etiological factor being Coxsackie virus B3 (CVB3). CVB3 is a globally prevalent picornavirus of the Enterovirus genus, and is often related to viral myocarditis (VM). Molecules derived from the virus, which act as PAMPs, are effective inducers of NETs. The role of neutrophils in virus-associated diseases is not previously emphasized, but research by Fairweather D et al. [149] reported that  the  severity  of  acute  myocarditis  was  closely  associated  with  the  accumulation  of neutrophils  in  the  heart.  Patients  and  mice  with  CVB3-induced  myocarditis  have  significantly increased  levels  of  S100A8/S100A9,  which  exacerbate  oxidative  stress  and  viral  replication  in myocarditis [150,  151] ,  further  indicating  the  important  role  of  neutrophils  in  the  antiviral  immune response [152] .  In  the  acute  phase  of  CVB3-induced  VM  in  mice, Vγ1γδT cells  are  the  main infiltrating cells with cardioprotective effects. However, with the depletion of Vγ1γδT cells,  the infiltration  of  NK  cells,  macrophages,  and  neutrophils  into  the  heart  gradually  increases [153] . Neutrophils mainly recognize CVB3 via endosomal TLR-8, thereby triggering NF-κB activation and inducing the release of NETs [154] , and neutrophil depletion mediated by anti-Ly6G antibodies or PAD4-dependent NETs blockade can reduce cardiac injury and leukocyte recruitment  [155] . Virus internalization leads to the increased cell survival, up-regulation of CD11b expression, enhanced adhesion of fibrinogen and fibronectin, and increased secretion of IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-8, promoting the migration of neutrophils to target organs and enhancing viral spread  [154] . Therefore, neutrophils play direct and indirect important roles in the pathogenesis of CVB3-induced VM. 5. Research Progress on Cardiac Remodeling Treatment Strategies Targeting Neutrophils At present, there are no widely used clinical standard drugs. Some studies have indicated that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can decrease the activation and aggregation of neutrophils,  decreasing  their  role  in  the  inflammatory  response  after  myocardial  infarction [156] . However, strategies for drug treatment of CVDs targeting neutrophils are still in the research and development  stage.  They  may  affect  the  behavior  of  neutrophils  (including  their  activation, recruitment, migration, and infiltration) through different mechanisms, reduce the production of NETs by neutrophils, enhance the phagocytic ability of neutrophils, and thereby prevent and treat CVDs.

Figure  3  Neutrophils  and  Cardiovascular  Diseases. Illustrates  the  complex  relationship between neutrophils and cardiovascular diseases. Neutrophils play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of  various  cardiovascular  conditions,  including  atherosclerosis,  myocardial  infarction,  and  heart failure. They contribute to inflammation, plaque formation, and tissue damage through the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, reactive oxygen species, and proteolytic enzymes. 5.1 Inhibition of Neutrophil Activation and Adhesion Stamp2 prevents maladaptive structural remodeling and contractile dysfunction of the heart after  ischemia  by  diminishing  neutrophil  activation [157] .  RTP-026  selectively  activates  formylpeptide receptor type 2 (FPR2), which can reduce the activation of neutrophils and monocytes, thereby decreasing the infarct size  [158] . Tetrandrine (TTD), isolated from the traditional Chinese medicinal  herb  Stephania  tetrandra,  hinders  neutrophil  adhesion,  suppresses  the  expression  and activity of Mac-1, and reduces the production of ROS, thus eliminating the subsequent infiltration that  causes  MI/R  injury [159] .  This  provides  a  novel  strategy  for  cardiac  protection,  namely,  the clinical targeting of neutrophil activation to mitigate inflammatory responses and tissue damage, thereby improving patient outcomes. 5.2 Reduction of Neutrophil Migration and Infiltration Evasin-3 is a CXC chemokine-binding protein that can bind to CXCL1, which can prevent its interaction with the receptor CXCR2, thereby inhibiting the biological activity of CXCL1. This reduction in neutrophil migration and infiltration into inflammatory sites may help to lower the risk of AS-related diseases  [160] . The nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) inhibitor FK866 can decrease the production of CXCL1 by endothelial cells, reduce the recruitment of neutrophils to ischemic myocardium, and subsequently alleviate inflammation in atherosclerotic plaques  [161] . CXCL8 recruits  neutrophils  through  the  PI3K/AKT  pathway,  and  curcumin  reduces  neutrophil recruitment by inhibiting this pathway, thereby mitigating inflammatory responses  [162] . In a mouse model of myocardial ischemia, administration of anti-CCL5 monoclonal antibodies significantly decreases the infarct size and lowers the risk of HF development, which is associated with reduced neutrophil recruitment in the infarcted heart  [163] . In an animal model of myocardial reperfusion, sgp130Fc reduces the infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages into the myocardium, decreasing infarct size and preserving cardiac function  [164]  . Necrosulfonamide (NSA) reduces the infiltration of neutrophils into the cardiac injury area by blocking the formation of pores by GSDMD on the cell  membrane,  thus  reducing  the  occurrence  of  pyroptosis [96] .  Colchicine  is  an  ancient  antiPreprint not peer reviewed

inflammatory drug that has been used for different rheumatic and immune diseases for many years. Recently, an increasing number of scholars have found that colchicine exerts a vital role in the treatment  of  CVDs [165] . One  of  the  mechanisms  is  that  colchicine  can  inhibit  microtubule polymerization by binding to tubulin dimers and negatively regulate the migration and infiltration of neutrophils after injury  [166] . These basic studies on related agents show that reducing neutrophil migration and infiltration, as a potential therapeutic approach, can provide protection to the heart, reduce infarct size, improve cardiac function, and thereby potentially improve patient prognosis. 5.3 Reduction of NETs Formation Inhibiting the protein components related to NETs, including MPO, PAD4, and CitH3, may also be one of the intervention methods. Nitroxides are a class of reversible MPO inhibitors that suppress the production of HOCl by serving as substrates for the MPO compound I, reducing the release of NETs  [167] . MPO inhibitors also include 4-aminobenzoic acid hydrazide  [167]  and PF1355 [168] , which can not only reduce neutrophil aggregation but also decrease the formation of NETs. Chloro-amidine, by inhibiting PAD4, can not only reduce NETosis but also inhibit the recruitment of neutrophils and macrophages to inflammatory sites, reducing the size of atherosclerotic lesions [169] .  DNase is a commonly used NETs inhibitor, Brinkmann et al  [79]  first demonstrated that the addition of DNase I in vitro degraded NETs. Basic research also shows that both DNase I and chloro-amidine  can  provide  additional  AS  protection  through  inhibiting  NETosis  in  mice [107] . However, the mechanism of action of DNase I does not prevent the production of NETs but rather decompose the structure of NETs  [170] , so its efficacy is still a matter of debate. In the MIRI model, MKEY treatment reduced the inflammatory response after MIRI, decreased the infarct size, and also  reduced  the  levels  of  CitH3  in  the  infarcted  tissue,  indicating  that  MKEY  can  prevent  the formation of NETs in the body  [171]  . The use of S100A8/A9 blocker ABR-238901 immediately after myocardial infarction can reduce the number of neutrophils in the myocardium and the presence of S100A9, reducing the size of myocardial infarction  [172] , and having a positive impact on cardiac injury. The development of new neutrophil-targeting therapeutic drugs and compounds targeting NETs-associated  protein  components  may  represent  a  change  in  the  current  treatment  status  of CVDs. 5.4 Enhancement of Neutrophil Phagocytic Capacity Treatment  of  rats  with  acute  myocardial  infarction  using  the  FPR2  agonist  BMS-986235 enhances  the  phagocytic  capacity  of  neutrophils,  aiding  in  the  clearance  of  dead  cells  and inflammatory mediators, lowering inflammatory damage, and enhancing adverse remodeling and cardiac function post-myocardial infarction [173] . Future therapies may combine multiple aspects of immunomodulation to achieve additional benefits, while other challenges such as the targeting of inflammation in cardiovascular disease patients must also be considered. 6. Conclusions and Perspectives In summary, as a vital immune cell of the body, neutrophils hold a significant position in the treatment of CVDs. Under the inflammatory immune environment in the body, neutrophils can interact with innate and adaptive immune cells within the body, jointly promoting the continuous chronic sterile inflammatory response in cardiovascular patients and participating in the occurrence and development of CVDs including AS, acute myocardial infarction, HF, atrial fibrillation, ischemia-reperfusion injury, and viral myocarditis. Research on the pathogenesis mainly focuses on the activation, recruitment of neutrophils, and increased production of NETs. Studying the role of neutrophils in the pathogenesis of CVDs can guide the treatment of these Preprint not peer reviewed

diseases, and targeting the activation of neutrophils may provide a new target for the prevention and treatment of these conditions. It is worth noting that the inconclusive results of current antiinflammatory drug trials in clinical settings highlight an incomplete understanding of the complex inflammatory networks in CVDs. Moreover, the use of NET inhibitors currently focus more on animal experiments, and in-depth research is lacking in clinical trials. Against the backdrop of the coexistence of risks and benefits in current anti-inflammatory treatments, further exploration of highly selective targeted drugs to avoid affecting the normal functions of neutrophils is a subject deserving further investigation. 7 Conflict of Interest The authors declare  that  the  research  was  conducted  in  the  absence  of  any  commercial  or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest. 8 Author Contributions LYJ 、 LXL and XWL contributed equally to this work ： writing, editing, and analysis.
