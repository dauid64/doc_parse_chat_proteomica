## Preface

My first book "Mass Spectrometry for Biotechnology"  introduced  the  capabilities  of  mass  spectrometry and  improvements  during  the  period between  1985  and  1994. These  developments  continued  and  were  largely  covered  in  the 2003 and 2006 editions of The Expanding Role of Mass Spectrometry in Biotechnology. This new book 'Activity Metabolomics  and  Mass  Spectrometry'  covers  some  of  the  same topics providing an overview of mass spectrometry with the inclusion of metabolomics. This reflects our interest in developing mass spectrometry technologies and the corresponding informatics (XCMS and METLIN) for identifying endogenous  metabolites  that  can  modulate  phenotype and    treat disease.    This  concept  of  discovering  endogenous metabolites to improve health via safe and cost-effective endogenous metabolites is simply building on a concept that has been around for centuries, examples of endogenous metabolites that act as therapeutics include hydrocortisone, progesterone, vasopressin, melatonin, to name a few.

## Chapter 1

## A History of Mass Spectrometry and Metabolomics

## Mass Spectrometry

Mass spectrometry has a special intrigue that comes from its interdisciplinary  nature,  as  it  freely  crosses  the  borders  of  physics, chemistry, and biology. Its history goes back to the early 1900's, and its development has reached a pinnacle in recent years, being widely applied to a range of problems. Thousands of women and men have contributed  to  the  development  of  mass  spectrometry,  and  this timeline  highlights  some  key  individuals  and  events.  Metabolomics and  the  study  of  metabolism  has  also  had  an  equally  interesting trajectory  encompassing  many  different  technologies,  however  it  is safe to say that mass spectrometry has been a key technology in its evolution ( Figure 1.1 ).

## Early Mass Spectrometry - The Physical Roots

The history of MS begins with J.J. Thomson ( Figure 1.2 ) of the University of Cambridge. Thomson's 'theoretical and experimental investigations on the conduction of electricity by gases' led  to  the  discovery  of  the  electron  in  1897 for  which  he  was awarded the 1906 Nobel Prize in Physics. In the first decade of the 20th century Thomson went on to construct the first mass spectrometer  (then  called  a  parabola  spectrograph),  in  which  ions were separated by their different parabolic trajectories in electromagnetic fields and detection occurred when the ions struck a fluorescent screen or photographic plate.

Later, Thomson's protÃ©gÃ©, Francis W. Aston (1922 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, Figure 1.3 ) of the University of Cambridge,

designed  a  mass  spectrometer  that  improved  resolving  power, allowing  Aston  to  study  isotopes.  During  this  same  period,  A.J. Dempster of the University of Chicago also improved upon resolution with a magnetic analyzer and developed the first electron ionization source, which ionized volatilized molecules with a beam of electrons. Electron ionization ion sources are still very widely used in modern mass  spectrometers  for  small  molecule  analysis.  Thomson,  Aston, and  Dempster  created  a  strong  foundation  of  MS  theory  and instrument  design  that  made  it  possible  for  those  who  followed  to develop  instruments  capable  of  meeting  the  demands  of  chemists and biologists.

An important goal, particularly for chemists, was to create an instrument capable of analyzing both the elements and small organic molecules.  Eventually  this  led  to  mass  analyzers  of  five  different forms:  magnetic  sector  double-focusing,  time-of-flight,  quadrupole, Fourier  transform  ion  cyclotron  resonance  and  fourier  transform orbitrap mass analyzers. In its time, the most widely used high massresolution  double-focusing  instrument  was  developed  by  Professor Alfred O.C. Nier at the University of Minnesota during World War II to perform isotopic analysis and separate uranium-235 from uranium238. The first nuclear bomb was developed entirely from the uranium separated by this type of mass spectrometer.

The  concept  of  time-of-flight  mass  spectrometry  (TOF  MS) was proposed in 1946  by  William  E.  Stephens  of  the  University  of Pennsylvania. In a TOF analyzer, ions are separated by differences in their  velocities  as  they  move  in  a  straight  path  toward  a  collector. TOF MS allows for rapid  analyses (5-20 kHz repetition  rates),  it  is capable of high resolving power and high accuracy, it is applicable to rapid  chromatographic  detection,  and  it  is  now  used  for  the  mass determination of large biomolecules because of its virtually limitless mass range.

One  type  of  mass  analyzer  that  proved  to  be  ideal  for coupling  to  gas  chromatography  and  liquid  chromatography  (in  the 1990s)  was  the  quadrupole  mass  filter.  The  quadrupole  was  first reported  in  the  mid-1950s  by  Wolfgang  Paul  ( Figure  1.4 ), who shared the 1989 Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on ion trapping. In a quadrupole  device,  a quadrupolar  electrical field

(comprising  radiofrequency  and  direct-current  components)  is  used to  separate  ions.  Although  quadrupole  mass  analyzers  are  not  as accurate  and  precise  as  double-focusing  instruments,  they  offer excellent  dynamic  range,  are  quite  stable,  and  are  also  readily applied  to  tandem  mass  spectrometry  experiments  -  features  that make  them  popular  for  quantitative  analysis  and  drug  discovery applications. Quadrupoles are the most widely used mass analyzers.

Figure 1.4. Paul's quadrupole and quadrupole ion trap resulted in  two  of  the  most  used  mass analyzers.

Ion cyclotron resonance MS (ICR-MS) and the orbitrap have proven  to  be  a  powerful  MS  solutions  for  high  resolution  and  high accuracy. ICR was initially described by John A. Hipple of the National Bureau  of  Standards,  Washington,  D.C.  It  operates  by  subjecting ions  to  a  simultaneous  radiofrequency  electric  field  and  a  uniform magnetic field, causing the ions to follow spiral paths in an analyzer chamber. By scanning the radiofrequency or magnetic field, the ions can  be  detected  sequentially.  In  1974,  Melvin  B.  Comisarow  and Alan G. Marshall of the University of British Columbia revolutionized ICR by developing Fourier transform ICR mass spectrometry (FTMS).  The  major  advantage  of  FTMS  is  that  it  allows  many different ions to be measured at once. Sub-part per million accuracy - such  as  an  error  of  less  than  0.001  Dalton  for  a  1000  Dalton peptide -is now routinely possible with commercial FTMS instruments. The orbitrap, released by Makarov in 2005, was the first high  resolution  and  sensitivity  trapping  type  of  mass  analyzer  that employed electrostatic fields which also employs FT data deconvolution.

## Ionization Advances allow for Biological Applications

A variety of  mass analyzer and tandem mass spectrometry designs are widely used today and are continually being developed for  new  applications.  Despite  advances  in  mass  accuracy,  mass range, quantitative analysis, and the ability to couple the instruments to  chromatography,  MS  still  lacked  efficacy  for  large  and  small biomolecule analysis. Significant molecular decomposition or fragmentation during vaporization/ionization and poor sensitivity proved  very  problematic  in  biomolecular  MS.  The  development  of 'soft  ionization'  -  electrospray  ionization  MS  (ESI  MS)  and  matrixassisted laser desorption/ionization MS (MALDI MS) - allowed MS to transcend into the realm of biology ( Figure 1.5 ).

In ESI MS,  highly charged droplets dispersed from a capillary in an electric field are evaporated, and the resulting ions are drawn  into  an  MS  inlet.  The  technique  was  first  conceived  in  the 1960s by chemistry professor Malcolm Dole of Northwestern University but was not put into practice for biomolecule analysis until the early 1980s by John B. Fenn of Yale University.

In  soft  laser  desorpton/ionization  and  matrix-assisted  laser desorption/ionization (MALDI)  MS,  analyte  molecules  are  laserdesorbed from a solid or liquid UV-absorbing matrix. The technique was initially reported by Koichi Tanaka and coworkers for proteins at Shimadzu  Corp.,  Kyoto,  Japan,  and  was  also  developed  by  Franz Hillenkamp and Michael Karas at the University of Frankfurt, Germany.

For  their work  on  developing  soft  ionization  techniques suitable for large biomolecule analysis, Fenn and Tanaka shared the 2002 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Their work on ESI-MS and MALDIMS  made MS  increasingly useful for sophisticated biological experiments. Applications include protein identification, drug discovery,  DNA  sequencing,  carbohydrate  analysis,  and  biomarker discovery.

## Small Molecule and Protein Analysis

The importance of these MS developments can be seen in research efforts at every major pharmaceutical company  and university.  Arguably  the  most  important  MS  application  is  in  small molecule and peptide quantification  using triple quadrupoles (QqQ) MS  ( Figure 1.6 ), the most widely used mass spectrometer. Endogenous biomolecules, exogenous molecules  and peptides  are routinely quantified with this technology. Perhaps most compelling is that virtually all newborns in the United States as well as elsewhere are tested with QqQs for over 30 different diseases.

Soft ionization ESI MS methods have made it possible to study  increasingly  larger  structures  and  their  noncovalent

interactions. ESI  instrumentation  designed  by  Henry  Benner  at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory was the first  to  measure  intact  viral ions measuring millions of Daltons, and earlier experiments show that viruses maintain their structure and virulence ( Figure 1.7 ).

## Metabolomics, Metabolism, &amp; Metabolites

The  100+  year  history of mass  spectrometry  pales in comparison to the centuries long history of metabolism. The discovery of  metabolites  and  the  subsequent  field  of  metabolomics has  played  a  critical role in advancing  biochemistry.  Hermann Boerhaave, an 18th-century scientist, and author of Elementa Chemiae characterized the first metabolite, urea, which set the stage for  identifying  the  other  most  abundant  metabolites  such  as  amino acids, sugars, and lipids over the next two centuries. However, with the emergence of advanced analytical technologies from the 1930s onwards,  finer details of metabolism  began  to  surface.  These technologies provided a much  clearer and detailed image of biochemistry, uncovering its structural complexity and revealing new metabolic activities.

## Metabolite Identification Across the Centuries

Recent advances ( Figure 1.8 ) have revitalized the importance of metabolism in many biological and therapeutic fields, including  cancer,  bioengineering,  systems  biology,  the

microbiome, and nutrition, among others. The integration of metabolomics, that includes a suite of technologies that characterize and quantify metabolites contributing to the structure, function, and dynamics of an organism, has provided an additional tool for classical biochemistry,  enabling  further  advances  in  biochemical  research. Mass spectrometry technology, particularly the  Nobel Prize-winning ESI, has made it possible to routinely observe intact molecular ions, a capability previously unachievable  for most  biomolecules. In addition,  ESI  has  enabled  sensitivity  several  orders  of  magnitude greater. These  breakthroughs  have  facilitated the discovery of metabolites  that  were  not  previously  known  to  exist  in  nature, including those found in multicellular organisms such as animals and plants, as well as unicellular microorganisms such as bacteria.

Determining  the  structures  of  unknown  metabolites  is  a significant  technological  challenge,  but  it  also  presents  an  exciting opportunity  to  expand  our  biochemical  knowledge  base  for  both characterized  and  uncharacterized  organisms.  The  identification  of all known and unknown small molecules in an organism, referred to as the metabolome, represents the future of metabolism discoveries. From  the  1700s  to  the  1900s,  newly  discovered  metabolites  were identified due to their ubiquitous nature. Their abundance made them easy  enough  to  be  isolated  and  characterized  by  the  analytical techniques available at that time (for example amino acids, monosaccharides,  and  nucleotides).  However,  in  recent  decades, the discovery of new and less ubiquitous metabolites and classes of metabolites  has  opened  new  avenues  of  research  and  led  to  a sustained  effort  to  characterize  and  understand  their  physiological effects.

## 1700s to 1900: Beginning of Metabolite Characterization

Take  some  very  fresh  well-concocted  Urine  of  persons  in  perfect Health,  put  it  preferentially  into  a  very  clean  Vessel,  and  with  an equable Heat of 200 degrees, evaporate it till you have reduced it to the consistence of fresh Cream' â¦'Put a large quantity of this thick inspissated Liquor into a tall cylindrical glass vessel with a paper tied over it and let it stand quite in a cool place for the space of a year..." Hermann Boerhaave (Duranton et al., 2016)

The analysis of small organic molecules, such as lactic acid, urea,  oxalic  acid,  and  citric  acid,  dates  back  to  the  1700s  when analytical  techniques  developed  by  Boerhaave  and  Lavoisier  were applied.  These  methods  were  later  improved  by  Gay-Lussac  and Thenard  in  the  early  1800s.  The  analysis  typically  involved  the isolation and purification of specific molecules from animal and food products,  such  as  citric  acid  from  lemons  and  lactic  acid  from fermented milk, using techniques such as distillation and crystallization.  The  atomic  weights  of  the  constituents  were  then derived through combustion analysis. While these chemical formulas were informative, they only allowed for structural hypotheses. Nonetheless, the early work on these molecules laid the foundation for subsequent advances in analytical chemistry and paved the way for modern metabolomics technologies.

During  the  19th  century,  significant  progress  was  made  in establishing  the  molecular  formulas  of  many  metabolites  (Thaulow, 1838). However, one of the most significant breakthroughs of this era was the publication  of  Justus  von  Liebig's  book  "Animal  Chemistry (Die  Thier-Chemie)"  (Freiherr  von  Liebig,  1843).  Liebig's  research laid the foundation for our knowledge of metabolic reactions and the inter-conversions  of  simple  organic  molecules  within  cells.  In  the book, Liebig inferred metabolic equations that described physiological  processes  based  solely  on  his  knowledge  of  organic chemistry,  without  any  evidence  of  their  existence  in  vivo.  This groundbreaking work allowed for the analysis of metabolic pathways and their regulation, paving the way  for further advances in biochemical research.

## 1900s: Analytical Technology Drives Discovery

The  1900s  ushered  in  a  remarkable  era  of  technological advancements that played a pivotal role in understanding the central carbon metabolism (Krebs cycle, Figure 1.9 ) of eukaryotic cells. The utilization  of  nuclear  reactors  as  a  source  of  artificial  radioisotopes and the development of x-ray crystallography and scintillation spectrometers  greatly  accelerated  biochemical

research  in  the  1930s  and  beyond.  The  development  of  nuclear magnetic  resonance  (NMR)  and  mass  spectrometry  (MS)  greatly advanced biochemical  methods and metabolomics principles. NMR was  first  described  by  Isidor  Rabi  in  1938  and  later  used  for  the analysis of liquids and solids by Bloch and Purcell. Simultaneously, chromatographic techniques developed by Archer Martin and Richard  Synge,  such  as  gas  chromatography  and  high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC), furthered the pace of research in the field.

By  1945,  most  of  the  analytical  techniques  necessary  for biochemical research were already available to the next generation of  researchers.  As  a  result,  by  1957,  biosynthetic  pathways  for virtually all types of known biological molecules had been elucidated, including lipids, carbohydrates, nucleic acid bases, amino acids, and vitamins.  In  fact,  in  1955,  Donald  Nicholson  compiled  all  of  this knowledge into a single map comprising approximately 20 metabolic pathways.  Thus,  molecular  formulas  and  metabolite  structures  had already  been  discovered  well  before  the  first  structure  of  a  protein (myoglobin)  with  atomic  resolution,  the  elucidation  of  the  DNA structure in 1953, or the subsequent publication in 1958 of molecular biology's  central  dogma.  However,  the  most  important  advances  in mass  spectrometry-based  metabolomics  were  made  by  Gohlke  et al.,  McLafferty  et  al.  who  introduced  collision  induced  dissociation (CID)  in  1968,  and  the  coupling  of  liquid  chromatography  to  mass spectrometry in 1974.

In the late 1940s  and  early  1950s,  Roger  J.  Williams introduced  the  concept  of  individual  biochemical  profiles.  The  first successful demonstration of mass spectrometry-based metabolomics  was  reported  in  1966  by  Dalgliesh  and  colleagues, who used GC/MS to separate and detect a wide range of metabolites in urine and biological tissue extracts. The term "metabolic profiles" was later introduced by Horning and colleagues, who, together with Linus  Pauling  and  Arthur  Robinson,  developed  GC/MS  methods  to simultaneously monitor dozens of metabolites in biological samples during the 1970s. This work was followed by important contributions from Gates and Sweeley, who established GC/MS as a quantitative tool for metabolic profiling.

## The development of electrospray ionization (ESI) by John

B. Fenn  in  1989  marked  a  significant  milestone  in  the  field  of metabolomics (and proteomics). The advent of ESI paved the way for the first LC-ESI MS-based untargeted metabolomics studies in 1994, leading to the discovery of the vast potential of untargeted metabolite profiling. However, these initial experiments also highlighted several mass spectrometric  improvements  that  needed  to  be  addressed  to enable effective interpretation of untargeted mass spectral data and the  identification  of  unknown  metabolites.  Specifically,  there  was  a need for peak detection and alignment in convoluted LC/MS spectra to statistically characterize meaningful metabolic features, as well as the need

for tandem mass spectrometry databases to facilitate rapid identification of unknown metabolites ( Figure 1.10 ).

## 21st Century Knowns: Metabolite Identification

In the 1800s and 1900s, the identification of metabolites was carried  out  one  at  a  time  by  isolating  and  characterizing  significant amounts  of  a  single  target  compound  from  natural  sources.  In contrast, modern 'omic' technologies and metabolomics are comprehensive  by  design,  aiming  to  characterize  and  quantify  all metabolites collectively. However, the mass spectral data generated from  these  technologies  produces  a  highly  complex  dataset  on thousands  of  molecules,  each  with  adducts,  isotopes,  in-source fragments, background, and contaminant ions. Consequently, there is a  distinction  between  metabolite  annotation  and  identification. Annotation  refers  to  the  assignment  of  a  candidate  metabolite  to multiple and redundant MS signals based on analytical characteristics such as retention time and m/z , whereas identification requires a much more tedious and conclusive process, assigning a chemical  structure  to  a  candidate  metabolite  through  comparison with  chemically  pure  standard  materials  or  conclusive  (2D)  NMR data.

As  a  result  ( Figure  1.11 ),  the  21st  century  has  seen  the development of increasingly sophisticated signal processing techniques  for  MS  and  NMR-based  metabolomics,  enabling  the annotation and identification of vast amounts of highly complex data. This includes a multitude of peak detection and alignment software. Tandem  (MS/MS)  mass  spectral  data  are  used  for  metabolite identification, which can produce structural information for hundreds or thousands  of metabolites in minutes. MS/MS  methods  are continually evolving  and  improving to match experimental data with spectral databases.

Spectral  databases  play  a  critical  role  in  the  metabolite annotation  process.  For  decades,  GC/MS  has  been  the  dominant identification  technology  due  to  the  vast  size  of  its  chemical  mass spectral  libraries.  For  instance,  the  National  Institute  for  Standards and Technology (NIST) has an impressive library of electron ionization (EI) mass spectra generated from over 300,000 compounds. However, since the advent of EI, MS technologies have undergone significant advancements. This progress was recognized by the 2002 Nobel Prizes, which acknowledged the development of two ionization approaches enabling the detection of intact biomolecules  (ESI  and  soft  laser  desorption  ionization).  ESI  has since  become  the  dominant  technology  due  to  its  "softer"  nature, making  it less destructive and  compatible with LC  separation methods. Nevertheless, the availability  of  publicly  available  MS/MS spectra for  small  molecules  and  metabolites  was  initially  limited  for LC-ESI  MS  approaches.  The  creation  of  the  first  database  of  ESI MS/MS  spectra  specifically  designed  for  the  identification  of  small molecules and metabolites in 2003 addressed this gap. Since then, numerous  public  and  commercial  databases  and  spectral  libraries have  been  established,  including  METLIN,  which  now  has  MS/MS experimental data on over 900,000 molecular standards.

## 21st Century of Unknowns: The Road Less Traveled

Metabolomics  scientists  often  face  the  daunting  task  of characterizing unknown unknowns, which involves identifying metabolites with unknown structures and functional roles. Major

technological advancements  are  required to answer  the many intriguing questions  surrounding  metabolism  research.  Assigning identities  to  the  thousands  of  spectral  signals  from  metabolomewide studies is a time-consuming process, and the characterization of unknown metabolites presents a significant bottleneck. Accurately identifying  metabolites  is  crucial  as  researchers  cannot  afford  to allocate precious resources to research on wrongly assigned metabolic  structures.  To  fully  comprehend  the  metabolome,  it  is essential  to  determine  the  origin,  fate,  and  functional  roles  of  each metabolite,  which  requires  significant  technological  advancements. Therefore, prioritizing the discovery and identification of metabolites is imperative to gain a comprehensive understanding of metabolism. Although, on a  bright  note,  it  is  coming  to  light  that  many  of  these signals  are  in-  source  fragments,  thus,  the  picture  may  not  be  as complicated as we once thought.

## 21st Century: The Road Ahead

At the turn of the 21st century, advances in technology and bioinformatics  enabled  the  large-scale  investigation  of  genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data, leading to the characterization of DNA/RNA and proteins. However, the study of metabolites proved to be  more  challenging  as  they  are  not  comprised  of  monomers  and required different approaches. It was not until the last two decades that  advancements  in  LC-MS/MS  and  bioinformatics  allowed  for comprehensive, metabolome-wide  investigations, leading to the discovery  of  new  metabolites  and  an  increased  coverage  of  the metabolome, despite the challenges posed by the dynamic range of endogenous metabolites ( Figure 1.12 ). A bottleneck in metabolomics has been the availability of a comprehensive database of  tandem  mass  spectra  for  metabolites,  but  this  issue  is  currently being addressed by multiple initiatives including METLIN.

Natural  language  processing,  NLP,  a  branch  of  AI  ( Figure 1.13 ),  will  likely  help  annotate  molecules  and  identify  biochemical relationships  between  them  even  when  there  are  no  reference spectra available. By embedding metabolic features in their biological context, we can improve the accuracy of annotations and shorten  the  list  of  possibilities.  This  can  be  achieved  by  cognitive literature  mining,  which  uses  NLP  and  machine  learning  to  extract key concepts from scientific literature and predict potential connections between entities.

## Overall

Over the last two centuries, the fields of mass spectrometry and  metabolism  have  experienced  a  remarkable  co-  evolution. Starting  from  early  efforts  to  understand  the  composition  of  gases and molecules, mass spectrometry has advanced tremendously and become a cornerstone of modern analytical chemistry. At the same time,  the  study  of  metabolism  has  undergone  a  similar  revolution, with  the  development  of  new  techniques  and  tools  that  allow  for  a more detailed understanding of the complex biochemical processes that  occur  within  living  organisms.  Together,  these  two  fields  have enabled a deeper understanding  of  the  fundamental  principles  that govern  life,  and  have  paved  the  way  for  new  breakthroughs  in medicine, biology, and many other fields. As we continue to push the limits of what is possible with mass spectrometry and metabolism, it is clear that

these two disciplines will continue to shape our understanding of the world around us for many years to come.

Urea  was  the  first  piece  of  the  puzzle  in  understanding metabolism, and centuries later, new discoveries are still being made thanks to technological advances especially in mass spectrometry. It is 'just' a matter of characterizing all the endogenous and exogenous molecules, a daunting yet exciting effort that will continue for decades to come.

## Mass Spectrometry

Mass spectrometry has been described as the smallest scale in the  world,  not  because  of  the  mass  spectrometer's  size  but because  of  the  size  of  what  it  weighs  --  molecules.  Over  the  past three decades mass spectrometry has undergone tremendous technological  improvements  allowing  for  its  application  to  proteins, peptides,  carbohydrates,  DNA,  drugs,  and  many  other  biologically relevant  molecules.  Due  to  ionization  sources  such  as  electrospray ionization (ESI) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI), mass spectrometry has become an irreplaceable tool in the biological  sciences.  This  chapter  provides  an  overview  of  mass spectrometry ionization sources and their significance in the development of mass spectrometry in biomolecular analysis.

## What is Mass Spectrometry?

A mass spectrometer determines the mass of a molecule by measuring  the  mass-to-charge  ratio  (m/z) of its ion. Ions are generated  by  inducing  either  the  loss  or  gain  of  a  charge  from  a neutral species. Once formed, ions are electrostatically directed into a  mass  analyzer  where  they  are  separated  according  to m/z and finally  detected.  The  result  of  molecular  ionization,  ion  separation, and ion detection is a spectrum that can provide molecular mass and even  structural  information.  An  analogy  can  be  drawn  between  a mass  spectrometer  and  a  prism,  as  shown  in Figure  2.1 .  In  the prism,  light  is  separated  into  its  component  wavelengths  which  are then detected with an optical receptor, such as visualization. Similarly,  a  mass  spectrometer's  ions  are  separated  in  the  mass analyzer,  digitized,  and  detected  by  an  ion  detector  (such  as  an electron multiplier, Chapter 3 ).

John B. Fenn, the originator of electrospray ionization for biomolecules  and  the  2002  Nobel  Laureate  in  Chemistry,  probably gave the best answers to the question 'what is mass spectrometry?':

Mass spectrometry is the art of measuring atoms and molecules to determine their molecular weight. Such mass or weight information is sometimes  sufficient,  frequently  necessary,  and  always  useful  in determining  the  identity  of  a  species.  To  practice  this  art  one  puts charge on the molecules of interest, i.e., the analyte, then measures how  the  trajectories  of  the  resulting  ions  respond  in  vacuum  to various  combinations  of  electric  and  magnetic  fields.  Clearly,  the sine qua non of such a method is the conversion of neutral analyte molecules into  ions.  For  small  and  simple  species  the  ionization  is readily carried by gas-phase encounters between the neutral molecules and electrons, photons, or other ions. In recent years, the efforts of many  investigators have  led to new  techniques  for producing  ions  of  species  too  large  and  complex  to  be  vaporized without substantial, even catastrophic, decomposition.

## Some Basics

Four basic components are, for the most part, standard in all mass  spectrometers  ( Figure  2.2 ): a  sample  inlet,  an  ionization source,  a  mass  analyzer,  and  an  ion  detector.  Some  instruments combine  the  sample  inlet  and  the  ionization  source,  while  others combine the  mass analyzer and the detector.  However,  all  sample molecules  undergo  the  same  processes  regardless  of  instrument configuration.  Sample molecules  are  introduced into the instrument through  a  sample  inlet.  Once  inside  the  instrument,  the  sample molecules  are  converted  to  ions  in  the  ionization  source,  before being electrostatically propelled into the mass analyzer. Ions are then separated  according  to  their  m/z  within  the  mass  analyzer.  The detector converts the ion energy into electrical signals, which are then transmitted to a computer.

## Sample Introduction Techniques

Sample introduction was an early challenge in mass spectrometry.  To  perform  mass  analysis  on  a  sample,  which  is initially at atmospheric pressure (760 torr), it must be introduced into the instrument in such a way that the vacuum inside the instrument remains relatively unchanged (~10 -6 torr). The most common methods of sample introduction are direct insertion with a probe or plate  commonly  used  with  MALDI-MS,  direct  infusion,  or  injection into the ionization source such as ESI-MS.

Figure 2.2.  Components of a mass spectrometer.  Note that the ion source does not have to be within the vacuum, for example, ESI and

## APCI are at atmospheric pressure and are known as atmospheric pressure ionization (API) sources.

Direct Insertion: Using an insertion probe/plate ( Figure 2.3 ) is a very simple way to introduce a sample into an instrument. The sample is first placed onto a probe and then inserted into the ionization region of the mass spectrometer, typically through a vacuum interlock. The sample  is  then  subjected  to  any  number  of  desorption  processes, such as laser  desorption  or  direct  heating,  to  facilitate  vaporization and ionization.

Figure 2.3.  Samples can be introduced into the mass spectrometer using a  direct  insertion  probe,  a  capillary  column  (EI  with  GC/MS or ESI) or a sample  plate  (MALDI).  The  vacuum  interlock  allows  for  the  vacuum  of the mass spectrometer to be maintained while the instrument is not in use.

Direct  Infusion:  A  simple  capillary  or  a  capillary  column  is  typically used to introduce a sample as a gas or in solution.  Direct infusion is also  useful  because  it  can  efficiently  introduce  small  quantities  of sample into a mass spectrometer without compromising the vacuum. Capillary columns are routinely used to interface separation techniques  with the ionization  source  of a  mass  spectrometer. These  techniques,  including  gas  chromatography  (GC)  and  liquid chromatography  (LC),  also  serve  to  separate  a  solution's  different components prior to mass analysis.  In gas

chromatography, separation of different components occurs within a glass  capillary  column.  As  the  vaporized  sample  exits  the  gas chromatograph, it is directly introduced into the mass spectrometer.

In  the  1980s  the  incapability  of  liquid  chromatography  (LC) with mass spectrometry was due largely to the ionization techniques being unable  to handle the continuous flow of LC. However, electrospray ionization (ESI), atmospheric pressure chemical ionization  (APCI)  and  atmospheric  pressure  photoionization  (APPI) now allows LC/MS to be performed routinely ( Figure 2.4 ).

Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry

Figure 2.4. Interfacing liquid chromatography with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. Liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) ion chromatogram and the corresponding electrospray mass  spectrum  are  shown.  Gas  chromatography  mass spectrometry (GC/MS) produces results in much the same way as LC/MS, however, GC/MS uses an electron ionization source, which is limited by thermal  vaporization  (UV  refers  to  ultraviolet  and  TIC  is  the  total  ion current).

## Ionization

Ionization  method  refers  to  the  mechanism  of  ionization while  the  ionization  source  is  the  mechanical  device  that  allows ionization  to  occur.  The  different  ionization  methods,  summarized here,  work  by  either  ionizing  a  neutral  molecule  through  electron ejection, electron capture, protonation, cationization, or deprotonation, or by transferring a charged molecule from a condensed phase to the gas phase.

## Deprotonation

Protonation is a method of ionization by which a proton is added to a molecule, producing a net positive charge of 1+ for every proton added.  Positive charges tend to reside on the more basic residues of the molecule, such as amines, to form stable cations. Peptides are often ionized via protonation.  Protonation can be achieved via matrix-assisted laser desorption/-ionization (MALDI), electrospray ionization (ESI) and atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI).

Deprotonation is an ionization method by which the net negative charge of 1- is achieved through the removal of a proton from a molecule. This mechanism of ionization, commonly achieved via MALDI, ESI, and APCI is very useful for acidic species including phenols, carboxylic acids, and sulfonic acids.  The negative ion mass spectrum of sialic acid is shown in Scheme 2.2 .

## Cationization

Cationization is a method of ionization that produces a charged complex by non- covalently adding a positively charged ion to a neutral molecule. While protonation could fall under this same definition, cationization is distinct for its addition of a cation adduct other than a proton (e.g. alkali, ammonium). Moreover, it is known to be useful with molecules unstable to protonation. The binding of cations other than protons to a molecule is naturally less covalent, therefore, the charge remains localized on the cation. This minimizes delocalization of the charge and fragmentation of the molecule. Cationization is commonly achieved via MALDI, ESI, and APCI. Carbohydrates are excellent candidates for this ionization mechanism, with Na +  a common cation adduct.

## Transfer of a charged molecule to the gas phase

The transfer of compounds already charged in solution is normally achieved through the desorption or ejection of the charged species from the condensed phase into the gas phase. This transfer is commonly achieved via MALDI or ESI.  The positive ion mass spectrum of tetraphenylphosphine is shown in Scheme 2.4.

## Electron capture

As its name implies, electron ejection achieves ionization through the ejection of an electron to produce a 1+ net positive charge, often forming radical cations. Observed most commonly with electron ionization (EI) sources, electron ejection is usually performed on relatively nonpolar compounds with low molecular weights, and it is also known to generate significant fragment ions.  The mass spectrum resulting from electron ejection of anthracene is shown in Scheme 2.5 .

With the electron capture ionization method, a net negative charge of 1- is achieved with the absorption or capture of an electron.  It is a mechanism of ion-ization primarily observed for molecules with a high electron affinity, such as halogenated compounds. The electron capture mass spectrum of hexachloro-benzene is shown in Scheme 2.6 .

## Ionization Sources

Prior  to  the  1980s,  electron  ionization  (EI)  was  the  primary ionization source for mass analysis. However, EI limited chemists and biochemists  to  small  molecules  well  below  the  mass  range  of common bio-organic compounds. This limitation motivated scientists such  as  John  B.  Fenn,  Koichi  Tanaka,  Franz  Hillenkamp,  Michael Karas,  Graham  Cooks,  and  Michael  Barber  to  develop  the  new generation of ionization techniques, including fast atom/ion bombardment (FAB), matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI), and electrospray ionization (ESI) (Table 2.2). These techniques have revolutionized biomolecular analyses, especially for large molecules. Among them, ESI and MALDI have clearly evolved to be the methods of choice when it comes to biomolecular analysis.

MALDI  and  ESI  are  now  the  most  common  ionization  sources  for biomolecular mass spectrometry, offering excellent mass range and sensitivity  ( Figure  2.5 ). The  following  section  will  focus  on  the principles of ionization sources,  providing  some  details  on  the practical aspects of their use as well as ionization mechanisms.

Figure 2.5. A glance at the typical sensitivity and mass ranges allowed by different ionization techniques provides a clear answer to the question of which  are  most  useful;  electrospray  ionization  (ESI),  nanoelectrospray ionization (nanoESI), and  matrix-assisted  laser desorption  ionization (MALDI) have a high sensitivity and  mass range.

## Electrospray Ionization

The original idea of electrospray developed in the 1930s and 1960s,  was  rejuvenated  with  its  application  to  biomolecules  in  the 1980s  resulting  in  the  2002  Nobel  Prize  for  John  Fenn.  The  first electrospray  experiments  were  carried  out  by  Chapman  in  the  late 1930s  and  the  practical  development  of  electrospray  ionization  for mass spectrometry was accomplished by Dole in the late 1960s. Dole also discovered the important phenomenon of

multiple charging of molecules. It was Fenn's work that ultimately led to the modern-day technique of electrospray ionization mass spectrometry and its application to biological macromolecules.

Electrospray ionization (ESI) is a method routinely used with endogenous  metabolites,  peptides,  proteins,  carbohydrates,  small oligonucleotides, synthetic polymers, and lipids. ESI produces gaseous ionized molecules directly from a liquid solution. It operates by creating a fine spray of highly charged droplets in the presence of an electric field. (An illustration of the electrospray ionization process is shown in Figures 2.6 and 2.7). The sample solution is sprayed from a  region  of  the  strong  electric  field  at  the  tip  of  a  metal  nozzle maintained  at  a  potential  of  anywhere  from  700  V  to  5000  V.  The nozzle (or needle) to which the potential is applied serves to disperse the  solution  into  a  fine  spray  of  charged  droplets.  Either  dry  gas, heat,  or  both  are  applied  to  the  droplets  at  atmospheric  pressure thus causing the solvent to evaporate from each droplet. As the size of the charged droplet decreases, the charge density on its surface increases. The mutual Coulombic repulsion between like charges on this surface becomes so great that it exceeds the forces of surface tension, and ions are ejected from the droplet through a 'Taylor

cone'  Figure  2.7.  Another  possibility  is  that  the  droplet  explodes releasing the ions. In either case, the emerging ions are directed into an orifice through electrostatic lenses leading to the vacuum of the mass analyzer. Because ESI involves the continuous introduction of solution, it is particularly suitable to interface with HPLC or capillary electrophoresis.

## Charged Electrospray Droplet

Figure  2.7. Ion formation  from  electrospray  ionization  source.  The electrospray  ionization  source  uses  a  stream  of  air  or  nitrogen,  heat,  a vacuum,  or  a solvent sheath (e.g., methanol)  to  facilitate droplet desolvation. Ion ejection occurs through a 'Taylor cone' (central droplet) where ions are then electrostatically directed into the analyzer.

Electrospray  ionization  is  conducive  to  the  formation  of singly charged small molecules but is also well-known for producing multiply  charged  species  of  larger  molecules.  This  is  an  important phenomenon because the mass spectrometer measures the massto-charge ratio (m/z) and  therefore multiple charging  makes  it possible to observe very large molecules with an instrument having a relatively small mass range. Fortunately, the software available with all  electrospray mass spectrometers facilitates the molecular weight calculations necessary to determine the actual mass of the multiply  charged  species.

Figures 2.7-2,9 illustrate the different charge states on two different proteins,  where  each  of  the  peaks  in  the  mass  spectra  can  be associated with different charge states of the molecular ion. Multiple charging has other important advantages in tandem mass spectrometry. One  advantage is that upon fragmentation you observe  more  fragment  ions  with  multiply  charged  precursor  ions than with singly charged precursor ions.

Multiple  charging :  A  10,000  Da  protein  and  its  theoretical  mass spectrum with up to five charges are shown in Figure 2.8 . The mass of the protein remains the same, yet the m/z ratio varies depending upon  the  number  of  charges  on  the  protein.  Protein  ionization  is usually the result of protonation, which not only adds charge but also increases the mass of the protein by the number of protons added. This  effect on  the m/z  applies  equally  for any  mechanism  of molecular  ionization  resulting  in  a  positively  or  negatively  charged molecular  ion,  including  the  addition  or  ejection  of  charge-carrying species  other  than  protons  (e.g.  Na+  and  Cs+).  Multiple  positive charges are observed for proteins, while for oligonucleotides negative charging (with ESI) is typical.

Figure  2.8.  A  theoretical  protein  with  a  molecular  weight  of  10,000 generates  three  different  peaks  with  the  ions  containing  5,  4,  and  3 charges, respectively. The mass spectrometer detects each of the protein ions at 2001, 2501, and 3334, respectively.

Although  electrospray  mass  spectrometers  are  equipped with software that will calculate molecular weight, an understanding of how the computer makes such calculations from multiply-charged ions is beneficial. Equations 1.1 - 1.5 and Figure 1.9  offer  a  simple  explanation,  where  we  assume  p1  and  p2  are adjacent peaks and differ by a single charge, which is equivalent to

the addition of a single proton.

Figure 2.9. The multiply charged ions of myoglobin generated from ESI. The different peaks represent different charge states of myoglobin. The molecular weight can be determined using Equations 1.1 - 1.3.

Mr = 16,951 Da for z1 = 11

## Electrospray Solvents

Many solvents can be used in ESI and are chosen based on the solubility of the compound of interest, the volatility of the solvent and the solvent's ability to donate a proton. Typically, protic primary solvents such as methanol, 50/50 methanol/water, or 50/50 acetonitrile/H2O  are  used,  while  aprotic  cosolvents,  such  as  10% DMSO in  water,  as  well  as  isopropyl  alcohol  are  used  to  improve solubility for some compounds. Although 100% water is used in ESI, water's  relatively  low  vapor  pressure  has  a  detrimental  effect  on sensitivity; better  sensitivity  is  obtained  when  a  volatile  organic solvent  is  added.  Some  compounds  require  the  use  of  straight chloroform with 0.1% formic acid added to facilitate ionization. This approach, while less sensitive, can be effective for otherwise insoluble compounds. Buffers such as Na+, K+ phosphate, and salts present a problem for ESI by lowering the

(2.5)

vapor pressure of the droplets resulting in reduced signal through an increase in droplet surface tension resulting in a reduction of volatility (see Chapter 3 for quantitative information on salt effects). Consequently, volatile buffers such as ammonium acetate are more effective.

## Configuration of the Electrospray Ion Source

The off-axis ESI configuration now used in many instruments to  introduce  the  ions  into  the  analyzers  (as  shown  in Figure  2.10 ) has turned out to be very valuable for high flow rate applications. The primary advantage of this configuration is that the flow rates can be increased without contaminating or clogging the inlet. Off-axis spraying  is  important  because  the  entrance  to  the  analyzer  is  no longer saturated by solvent, thus keeping droplets from entering and contaminating  the  inlet.  Instead,  only  ions  are  directed  toward  the inlet.  This  makes  ESI  even  more  compatible  with  LC/MS  at  the milliliter per minute flow rates.

Figure 2.10. An example of off-axis ESI.

## Nanoelectrospray Ionization (NanoESI)

Low  flow  electrospray,  originally  described  by  Wilm  and Mann,  has  been  called  nanoelectrospray,  nanospray,  and  microelectrospray. This ionization source is a variation on ESI, where the spray  needle  has  been  made  very  small  and  is  positioned

close to the entrance to the mass analyzer ( Figure  2.11 ).  The  end result of this rather simple adjustment is increased efficiency, which includes a reduction in the amount of sample needed.

Figure 2.11. Nanoelectrospray ionization (NanoESI).

<!-- image -->

The flow rates for nanoESI sources are on the order of tens to hundreds of nanoliters per minute. In order to obtain these low flow rates, nanoESI uses emitters of pulled and in some cases metallized glass  or  fused  silica  that  have  a  small  orifice  (~5Âµ).  The  dissolved sample is added to the emitter and a pressure of ~30 PSI is applied to the back of the emitter.  Effusing the sample at very low flow rates allows  for  high  sensitivity.  Also,  the  emitters  are  positioned  very close to the entrance of the mass analyzer, therefore ion transmission  to  the  mass  analyzer  is  much  more  efficient.  For instance,  the  analysis  of  a  5  mM  solution  of  a  peptide  by  nanoESI would  be  performed  in  1  minute,  consuming  ~50  femtomoles  of sample.  The  same  experiment  performed  with  normal  ESI  in  the same  time  period  would  require  5  picomoles,  or  100  times  more sample than for nanoESI. In addition, since the droplets are typically smaller with nanoESI than normal ESI ( Figure 2.11 ), the amount of evaporation necessary to obtain ion

## Atmospheric Pressure Chemical Ionization

APCI  has  also  become  an  important ionization source because it generates ions  directly  from  solution  and  it  can  analyze relatively  nonpolar compounds. Like electrospray, the liquid effluent of APCI  ( Figure  2.12 ) is introduced  directly  into  the  ionization source.  However,  the  similarity  stops  there.  The  droplets  are  not charged  and  the  APCI  source  contains  a  heated  vaporizer,  which facilitates  rapid  desolvation/vaporization  of  the  droplets.  Vaporized sample  molecules  are  carried  through  an  ion-  molecule  reaction region  at  atmospheric  pressure.  The  ionization  originates  from  the solvent  being  excited/ionized  from  the  corona  discharge.  Because the  solvent  ions  are  present  at  atmospheric  pressure  conditions, chemical ionization of analyte molecules is very efficient; at atmospheric pressure analyte molecules collide with the reagent ions frequently. Proton transfer (for protonation MH+ reactions) occurs in the positive mode, and either electron transfer or proton loss, ([M-H]-) in the  negative  mode.  The  moderating  influence  of  the  solvent clusters on the reagent ions, and of the high gas pressure, reduces fragmentation during ionization and results in primarily intact molecular ions. Multiple charging is typically not observed presumably  because  the  ionization  process  is  more  energetic  than ESI.

## Atmospheric Pressure Photoionization

Figure  2.13. Atmospheric pressure photoionization (APPI) mass spectrometry.

<!-- image -->

Atmospheric  pressure  photoionization  (APPI)  has  recently become  an  important  ionization  source  because  it  generates  ions directly from solution with relatively low background and is capable of analyzing  relatively nonpolar  compounds.  Like  APCI,  the  liquid effluent of APPI  ( Figure 2.13 ) is introduced directly into the ionization source. The primary difference between APCI and APPI is that  the  APPI  vaporized  sample  passes  through  ultra-violet  light  (a typical  krypton  light  source  emits  at  10.0  eV  and  10.6  eV).  Often, APPI is much more sensitive than ESI or APCI and has been shown to  have  higher  signal-to-noise  ratios  because  of  lower  background ionization. Lower background signal is largely due to high ionization potential of standard solvents such as methanol and water (IP 10.85 and 12.62 eV, respectively) which are not ionized by the krypton lamp.

A  disadvantage  of  both  ESI  and  APCI  is  that  they  can generate background ions from solvents. Additionally, ESI is especially susceptible to ion suppression effects, and APCI requires vaporization  temperatures  ranging  from  350-500Â°  C,  which  can cause thermal degradation.

APPI induces ionization  via  two  different  mechanisms.  The first  is  direct  photoexcitation,  allowing  for  electron  ejection  and  the generation of the positive ion radical cation (M+.). The

APPI source  imparts  light  energy  that  is  higher  than  the  ionization potentials (IPs) of most target molecules, but lower than most of the IPs of air and solvent molecules, thus removing them as interferants. In addition, because little excess energy is deposited in the molecules, there is minimal fragmentation.

The  second  mechanism  is  atmospheric  pressure  photoinduced  chemical  ionization  which  is  like  APCI  in  that  it  involves charge transfer to produce protonation (MH+) or proton loss ([M- H]-) to generate negative ions.

To  initiate  chemical  ionization,  a  photo  ionizable  reagent, also called a dopant, is added to the eluant. Upon photoionization of the dopant, charge transfer occurs to the analyte. Typical dopants in positive mode include acetone and toluene.  Acetone also serves as a dopant in negative mode.

The  ionization mechanism  (M+.  versus  [M+H]+)  that  a molecule undergoes depends on the proton affinity of the analyte, the solvent, and the type of dopant used.

## Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization (MALDI)

Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry  (MALDI-MS)  was  first  introduced  in  1988  by  Tanaka, Karas, and Hillenkamp. It has since become a widespread analytical tool for peptides, proteins, and most other biomolecules (oligonucleotides,  carbohydrates,  natural  products,  and  lipids).  The efficient and directed energy transfer during a matrix-assisted laserinduced  desorption  event  provides  high  ion  yields  of  the  intact analyte  and  allows  for  the  measurement  of  compounds  with  subpicomole sensitivity.  In addition, the utility of MALDI for the analysis of  heterogeneous  samples  makes  it  very  attractive  for  the  mass analysis of complex biological samples such as proteolytic digests.

<!-- image -->

Figure 2.14. The directed energy transfer of the UV laser pulse during a MALDI event allows for relatively small quantities of sample (femtomole to  picomole)  to  be  analyzed.  In  addition,  the  utility  of  MALDI  mass spectrometry  for  the  analysis  of  heterogeneous  samples  makes  it  very attractive for the mass analysis of biological samples.

<!-- image -->

While  the  exact  desorption/ionization  mechanism  for  MALDI  is  not known, it is generally believed that MALDI causes the ionization and transfer of a sample from the condensed phase to the gas phase via laser excitation and vaporization of the sample matrix ( Figure 2.14 ). In  MALDI  analysis,  the  analyte  is  first  co-  crystallized  with  a  large molar  excess  of  a  matrix  compound,  usually  a  UV-absorbing  weak organic  acid.  Irradiation  of  this  analyte-matrix  mixture  by  a  laser result in the vaporization of the matrix, which carries the analyte with it.  The matrix plays a key role in this technique. The co-crystallized sample  molecules  also  vaporize,  but  without  having  to  directly absorb energy from the laser. Molecules sensitive to the laser light are therefore protected from direct UV laser excitation.

MALDI matrix -- A nonvolatile solid material facilitates the desorption and ionization process by absorbing the laser radiation. As a result, both  the matrix and  any  sample  embedded  in  the  matrix  are vaporized. The matrix also serves to minimize sample damage from laser radiation by absorbing most of the incident energy.

Once in the gas phase, the desorbed charged molecules are then directed electrostatically from the MALDI ionization source into the  mass  analyzer.  Time-of-flight  (TOF)  mass  analyzers  are  often used  to  separate  the  ions  according  to  their  mass-to-charge  ratio (m/z).  The  pulsed  nature  of  MALDI  is  directly  applicable  to  TOF analyzers since the ion's initial time-of- flight can be started with each pulse of the laser and completed when the ion reaches the detector.

Several theories have been developed to explain desorption by  MALDI.  The  thermal-spike  model  proposes  that  the  ejection  of intact molecules is attributed to poor vibrational coupling between the matrix and analyte, which minimizes vibrational energy transfer from the matrix to the vibrational modes of the analyte molecule, thereby minimizing fragmentation. The pressure pulse theory proposes that a pressure  gradient  from  the  matrix  is  created  normal  to  the  surface and  desorption  of  large  molecules  is  enhanced  by  momentum transfer from collisions with these fast-moving matrix molecules. It is generally  thought  that  ionization  occurs  through  proton  transfer  or cationization during the desorption process.

The utility of MALDI for biomolecule analyses lies in its ability to  provide  molecular  weight  information  on  intact  molecules.  The ability  to  generate  accurate information can be extremely useful for protein identification and characterization. For example, a protein can often be unambiguously identified by the accurate mass analysis of its  constituent  peptides  (produced  by  either  chemical  or  enzymatic treatment of the sample).

Sample-matrix preparation  procedures  greatly  influence  the quality  of  MALDI  mass  spectra  of  peptides/proteins  ( Figure  2.15 ). Among the variety of reported preparation methods, the dried-droplet method is the most frequently used. In this case, a saturated matrix solution is mixed with the analyte solution, giving a matrix-to-sample ratio of about 5000:1. An aliquot (0.5-2.0 ÂµL) of this mixture is then applied to the sample target where it is allowed to dry. Below is an example of how the dried-droplet method is performed:

- Â· Pipet 0.5 Âµ L of sample to the sample plate.
- Â· Pipet 0.5 Âµ L of matrix to the sample plate.
- Â· Mix the sample and matrix by drawing the combined droplet in and out of the pipette.
- Â· Allow to air dry.

Alternatively, samples can be prepared in a stepwise manner.  In  the  thin  layer  method,  a  homogeneous  matrix  'film'  is formed  on  the  target  first,  and  the  sample  is  then  applied  and absorbed by the matrix. This method yields good sensitivity, resolving  power,  and  mass  accuracy.  Similarly,  in  the  thick-layer method,  nitrocellulose  (NC)  is  used  as  the  matrix  additive;  once  a uniform  NC-matrix  layer  is  obtained  on  the  target,  the  sample  is applied. This preparation method suppresses alkali adduct formation and  significantly  increases  the  detection  sensitivity,  especially  for peptides and proteins extracted from gels. The sandwich method is another  variant  in  this  category.

## Desorption/Ionization on Silicon (DIOS)

DIOS  is a matrix-free method that uses pulsed laser desorption/ionization  on  silicon  ( Figure  2.16 ). Structured  silicon surfaces  such  as  porous  silicon or silicon nanowires  are  UVabsorbing  semiconductors  with  a  large  surface  area  (hundreds  of m2/cm3).  For  its  application  to  laser  desorption/ionization  mass spectrometry,  the  structure  of  structured  silicon  provides  a  scaffold for retaining solvent and analyte molecules, and the UV absorptivity affords  a  mechanism  for  the  transfer  of  the  laser  energy  to  the analyte. This fortuitous combination of characteristics allows DIOS to be  useful  for  a  large  variety  of  biomolecules  including  peptides, carbohydrates,  and  small  organic  compounds  of  various  types. Unlike other direct, matrix- free desorption techniques, DIOS enables desorption/ionization with little or no analyte degradation.

DIOS has a great deal in common with MALDI. Instrumentation and acquisition using DIOS-MS requires only minor adjustments  to  the  MALDI  setup;  the  chips  are  simply  affixed  to  a machined MALDI plate and inserted into the spectrometer. The same wavelength  of  laser  light  (337  nm)  typically  employed  in  MALDI  is effective for DIOS. While DIOS is comparable to MALDI with respect to its sensitivity, it has  several  advantages  due  to  the  lack  of interfering  matrix:  low  background  in  the  low  mass  range;  uniform deposition  of  aqueous  samples;  and  simplified  sample  handling.  In addition, the chip-based format can be adapted to automated sample handling,  where  the  laser  rapidly  scans  from  spot  to  spot.  DIOS could  thus  accelerate  and  simplify  high-throughput  analysis  of  low molecular weight compounds, as MALDI has done for macromolecules. Because  the  masses  of  many  low  molecular weight  compounds  can  be  measured,  DIOS-MS  can  be  applied  to the analysis of small molecule transformations, both enzymatic and chemical.

In a number of recent advances with DIOS-MS, the modification of the silicon surface with fluorinated silyating reagents have allowed for ultra-high sensitivity in the yoctomole range ( Figure 2.16 ).

## Fast Atom/Ion Bombardment

Fast atom/ion bombardment, or FAB, is an ionization source ( Figure 2.17 )  similar to MALDI in that it uses a matrix and a highly energetic  beam  of  particles  to  desorb  ions  from  the  surface  of  the matrix. It is important, however, to point out the differences between MALDI and FAB. For MALDI, the energy beam is pulsed laser light, while  FAB uses a continuous ion beam. With MALDI, the matrix is typically a solid crystalline, whereas FAB typically has a liquid matrix. It is also  important  to  note  that  FAB  is  about  1000  times  less sensitive than MALDI.

Figure  2.17. Fast  atom  bombardment  (FAB)  mass  spectrometry,  aka liquid secondary ion mass spectrometry (LSIMS).

Fast  atom  bombardment  is  a  soft  ionization  source  which requires the use of a direct insertion probe for sample introduction, and a beam of Xe neutral atoms or Cs+ ions to sputter the sample and matrix from the direct insertion probe surface. It is common to detect matrix  ions  in  the  FAB  spectrum  as  well  as  the  protonated  or cationized (i.e. M+Na+) molecular ion of the analyte of interest.

FAB matrix - Facilitating the desorption and ionization process, the FAB matrix is a nonvolatile liquid material that serves to constantly replenish  the  surface  with  new  sample  as  it  is  bombarded  by  the incident  ion  beam.  By  absorbing  most  of  the  incident  energy,  the matrix  also  minimizes  sample  degradation  from  the  high-energy particle beam.

Two  of  the  most  common  matrices  used  with  FAB  are  mnitrobenzyl alcohol and glycerol.

The fast atoms or ions impinge on or collide with the matrix causing the matrix and analyte to be desorbed into the gas phase. The sample may already be charged and subsequently transferred into  the  gas  phase by FAB, or it may become charged during FAB desorption  through  reactions  with  surrounding  molecules  or  ions. Once  in  the  gas  phase,  the  charged  molecules  can  be  propelled electrostatically to the mass analyzer.

## Electron Ionization

Electron  ionization  is  one  of  the  most  important  ionization sources  for  the  routine  analysis  of  small,  hydrophobic,  thermally stable molecules  and  is  still widely used. Because  EI  usually generates  numerous  fragment  ions  it  is  a  'hard'  ionization  source. However, the fragmentation information can also be very useful. For example, by employing databases containing over 200,000 electron ionization mass  spectra,  it is possible to identify an  unknown compound  in  seconds  (provided  it  exists  in  the  database).  These databases,  combined  with  current  computer

storage capacity and searching algorithms, allow for rapid comparison with these databases (such as the NIST database), thus greatly facilitating the identification of small molecules.

Figure 2.18.  Electron ionization (EI) mass spectrometry

The  electron  ionization  source  is  straightforward  in  design ( Figure  2.18 ).  The  sample  must  be  delivered  as  a  gas  which  is accomplished  by  either  'boiling  off'  the  sample  from  a  probe  via thermal desorption, or by introduction of a gas through a capillary. The capillary is often the output of a capillary column from gas chromatography  instrumentation.  In  this  case,  the  capillary  column provides separation (this is also known as gas chromatography mass spectrometry or GC/MS). Desorption of both solid and liquid samples is facilitated by heat as well as the vacuum of the mass spectrometer. Once in the gas phase the compound passes into an electron ionization source, where electrons excite the molecule, thus causing electron ejection ionization and fragmentation.

The  utility  of  electron  ionization  decreases  significantly  for compounds  above  a  molecular  weight  of  400  Da  because  the required  thermal  desorption  of  the  sample  often  leads  to  thermal decomposition  before  vaporization  is  able  to  occur.  The  principal problems associated with thermal desorption in electron ionization are 1)  involatility  of  large  molecules,  2)  thermal  decomposition,  and  3) excessive fragmentation.

The method, or mechanism, of electron ejection for positive ion formation proceeds as follows:

- Â· The sample is thermally vaporized.
- Â· Electrons  ejected  from  a  heated  filament  are  accelerated through an electric field at 70 V to form a continuous electron beam.
- Â· The sample molecule is passed through the electron beam.
- Â· The  electrons,  containing  70  V  of  kinetic  energy  (70 electron volts or 70 eV), transfer some of their kinetic energy to the molecule.  This transfer  results  in  ionization  (electron  ejection)  with the ion internally retaining usually no more than 6 eV excess energy and excess internal energy (5 eV) leads to some  degree  of fragmentation.

capture  is  usually  much  less  efficient  than electron  ejection, yet it  is  sometimes  used  in the following way for high sensitivity work with compounds having a high electron affinity:

## Chemical Ionization

Chemical  Ionization  (CI)  is  applied  to  samples  similar  to those analyzed by EI and is primarily used to enhance  the abundance  of  the  molecular  ion. Chemical  ionization  uses  gas phase  ion-molecule reactions within the vacuum  of the mass spectrometer  to produce  ions  from  the sample  molecule.  The chemical  ionization  process  is  initiated  with  a  reagent  gas  such  as methane,  isobutane,  or  ammonia,  which  is  ionized  by  electron impact.  High  gas-pressure  in  the  ionization  source  results  in  ionmolecule reactions  between  the  reagent  gas  ions  and  reagent  gas neutrals.  Some  of  the  products  of  the  ion-molecule  reactions  can react with the analyte molecules to produce ions.  A mechanism

for ionization in CI occurs as follows:

In  contrast  to  EI,  an  analyte  is  more  likely  to  provide  a molecular ion with reduced fragmentation using CI. However, like EI, samples  must  be  thermally  stable  since  vaporization  within  the  CI source occurs through heating.

Figure  2.19.  The  pentafluorobenzyl  trimethyl  silyl  ether  derivatives  of steroids  make  them  more  amenable  to  high  sensitivity  measurements using negative chemical ionization.

<!-- image -->

Negative  chemical  ionization  (NCI)  typically  requires  an analyte that contains electron-capturing moieties (e.g., fluorine atoms or nitrobenzyl  groups). Such  moieties  significantly  increase  the sensitivity of NCI, in some cases 100 to 1000 times greater than that of electron ionization (EI). NCI is probably one of the most sensitive techniques and is used for a wide variety of small molecules with the caveat  that  the  molecules  are  often  chemically  modified  with  an electron-capturing moiety prior to analysis.

While most compounds will not produce negative ions using EI or CI, many important compounds can produce negative ions and, in some  cases,  negative  EI  or  CI  mass  spectrometry  is  more sensitive and selective than positive ion analysis. Steroids are often modified ( Figure 2.19 ) to enhance NCI.

As  mentioned,  negative  ions  can  be  produced  by  electron capture,  and  in  negative  chemical  ionization  a  buffer  gas  (such  as methane) can slow down the electrons in the electron beam allowing them to be captured by the analyte molecules. The buffer gas also stabilizes the excited anions and reduces fragmentation. Therefore, NCI  is  actually  an  electron  capture  process  and  not  what  would traditionally be called 'chemical ionization'.

## NanoSIMS

Nano  secondary  ion  mass  spectrometry  (NanoSIMS)  has recently  become  known  for  ultrahigh  resolution,  making  subcellular quantitative  imaging  at  the  organelle  level  possible.  A  remarkable achievement.  NanoSIMS  ( Figure  2.20 )  is  an  advanced  technology that  employs a highly focused ion beam to produce high-resolution images with sub-50 nm resolution. This technique has facilitated the visualization  of  biological  samples  at  the  subcellular  level,  allowing scientists to delve into intricate details.

## Summary

The  mass  spectrometer  can  be  separated  into distinct sections that include the sample inlet, ion source, mass analyzer, and detector. A sample is introduced into the mass spectrometer and is then  ionized.  The  ion  source  produces  ions  either  by  electron ejection, electron capture, cationization, deprotonation or the transfer of a charged molecule from the condensed to the gas phase. MALDI and  ESI,  especially  ESI,  have  had  a  profound  effect  on  mass spectrometry  because  they  generate  charged  intact  biomolecules into the gas phase.  In comparison to other ionization sources such as APCI, EI, FAB, and CI, the techniques of MALDI and ESI have greatly extended the analysis capabilities of mass spectrometry to a wide range of compounds with detection capabilities ranging from the picomole to the zeptomole level.

## Questions and Answers

- Â· What are the primary disadvantages of electron ionization?

EI requires that the molecules be thermally stable to enable it to be generated in the  gas phase.  Many  molecules, especially  of biological origin, degrade when exposed to heat.

- Â· Why is it important to generate the intact ion?
- Generation of intact molecular ions in the  gas phase is one of the great achievements of MS. Intact ion generation significantly reduces the ambiguity associated with identifying molecules and is why ESI is so popular.
- Â· Why is ESI useful for studying noncovalent interactions?
- For  the  same  reason  it  is  great  at  generating  intact  molecular ions, ESI is a very soft ionization technique.
- Â· What is the purpose of the matrix in MALDI?

The MALDI matrix serves multiple purposes, it helps screen  the analyte    molecules    from    laser

## 2. Ionization

photodegradation,  it  also  serves  as  a  proton  source  for ionization (and with basic matricies, a proton sink). And the matrix (when exposed to pulsed laser radiation) also serves as a medium for intact molecular ejection and ionization in the gas phase.

- Â· What effect does multiple charging have on the mass-tocharge  ratio ( m/z )?

2,

- A single charge like a proton, will result in eeing s the molecular ion plus a proton in the m/z spectrum. Two  rotons p attaching to the molecule will result in  ving obser (molecular ion plus 2 protons) divided by in the m/z spectrum. And so onâ¦

## Mass Analyzers

## Ionization to Analysis

With the advent and improvements of atmospheric pressure ionization sources in the 1980s, it became necessary to improve mass analyzer performance with respect to speed, accuracy, and resolution ( Figure  3.1 ).  More  specifically,  all  mass  analyzers  have  undergone numerous modifications/improvements over the past decade in order to be interfaced with these ionization sources. The biggest challenge came in the interfacing atmospheric pressure ionization sources (760 torr) to analyzers maintained at 10 -6  to 10 -11  torr, a remarkable 9 orders of  magnitude  pressure  differential.  This  chapter  will  focus  on  the principles of operation and current performance capabilities of mass analyzers,  also  touching  on  detectors  and  the  necessity  of  low pressures (vacuum) within the mass spectrometer.

## Mass Analysis Performance

Analytical  instruments  in  general  have  variations  in  their capabilities as a result of their individual design and intended purpose. This is also true for mass spectrometers. While all mass spectrometers rely on a mass analyzer, not all analyzers operate in the same way ( Table 3.1 ), some separate ions in space while others separate ions by time. In the most general terms, a mass analyzer measures gas phase ions with respect to their mass-to-charge ratio ( m/z ),  where  the  charge  is  produced  by  the  addition  or  loss  of  a proton(s),  cation(s),  anion(s)  or  electron(s).  The  addition  of  charge allows the molecule to be affected by electric fields thus allowing its mass measurement. This is an important aspect to remember about mass analyzers -- they measure the m/z ratio, not the mass. It is often a point of confusion because if an ion has multiple charges, the m/z will be significantly less than the actual mass ( Figures 2.8 and 2.9 ). For example, a doubly charged peptide ion of mass 976.5 Daltons (Da) (C37H68N16O1  2+ ) has an m/z of 488.3.

The  first  mass  analyzers,  made  in  the  early  1900's,  used magnetic fields to separate ions according to their radius of curvature through  the  magnetic  field.  The  design  of  modern  analyzers  has changed significantly in the last five years, now offering much higher accuracy, increased sensitivity, broader mass range, and the ability to

provide  structural  information.  Because  ionization  techniques  have evolved,  mass  analyzers  have  been  forced  to  change  to  meet  the demands of analyzing a wide range of biomolecular ions with part per million mass accuracy and sub femtomole sensitivity. The characteristics ( Table  3.1 )  of  these  mass analyzers will be covered including their respective performance characteristics including: accuracy, resolution, mass range, tandem analysis capabilities, and scan speed.

## Accuracy

Accuracy is the ability with which the analyzer can accurately provide m/z information and is largely a function of an instrument's stability and  resolution.  For  example,  an  instrument  with  0.01% accuracy can provide information on a 1000 Da peptide to Â±0.1 Da or a 10,000 Da protein to Â±1.0 Da. The accuracy varies dramatically from analyzer to analyzer depending on the analyzer type and resolution. An alternative means of describing accuracy is using part per million (ppm) terminology, where 1000 Da peptide to Â±0.1 Da could also be described as 1000.00 Da peptide to Â± 100 ppm.

## Resolution (Resolving Power)

Resolution is the ability of a mass spectrometer to distinguish between ions  of  different  mass-to-charge  ratios.  Therefore,  greater resolution corresponds directly to the increased ability to differentiate ions.  The  most  common  definition  of  resolution  is  given  by  the following equation:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Equation 3.1

where M corresponds to m/z and ï£½ M represents the full width at half maximum (FWHM). An example of resolution measurement is shown in Figure 3.2 where the peak has an m/z of 500 and a FWHM of 1. The resulting resolution is M/ ï£½ M = 500/1 = 500.

## Resolution = MIAM

Figure 3.2. Theresolution is  determined by the measurement of peak's m/z and FWHM , in this case m/z = 500 and the FWHM = 1.

<!-- image -->

The  analyzer's resolving power  does, to some  extent, determine the accuracy of a particular instrument, as characterized in Figure 3.2 . The average mass of a molecule is calculated using the weighted average mass of all isotopes of each constituent element of the molecule. The monoisotopic mass is calculated using the mass of the  elemental  isotope  having  the  greatest  abundance  for  each constituent element. If an instrument cannot resolve the isotopes, it will generate a broad peak with the center representing the average mass. Higher resolution can offer the benefits of separating an ion's individual isotopes or the narrowing of peaks allows a more accurate determination of its position. Resolution however can change depending on the m/z being measured by a particular instrument.

## Mass Range

Mass  range  is  the m/z range  of  the  mass  analyzer.  For instance,  quadrupole  analyzers  typically  scan  up  to m/z 3000.  A magnetic sector analyzer typically scans up to m/z 10,000 and timeof-flight analyzers have virtually unlimited m/z range.

## Tandem Mass Analysis (MS/MS or MS n )

Tandem  mass  analysis  ( Figure  3.3 ) is  the  ability  of  the analyzer to separate different molecular ions, generate fragment ions from a selected ion, and then mass measure the fragmented ions. The fragmented  ions  are  used  for  structural  determination  of  original molecular ions. Typically, tandem MS experiments are performed by colliding  a  selected  ion  with  inert  gas  molecules  such  as  argon  or helium, and the resulting fragments are mass analyzed. Tandem mass analysis is used to sequence peptides, and structurally characterize carbohydrates, small oligonucleotides, and lipids. And it is widely used in clinical analyses, drug development, and a host of other areas.

Figure 3.3. Tandem mass spectrometry analysis.

<!-- image -->

The  term  'tandem'  mass  analysis  comes  from  the  events occurring either tandem in space or time. Tandem mass analysis in space  is  performed  by  consecutive  analyzers  while  tandem  mass analysis in time is performed with the same analyzer, which isolates and  fragments  the  ion  of  interest,  then  analyzes  the  fragments. Different analyzers characteristics are summarized in Table 3.2 .

## Scan Speed

Scan speed refers to the rate at which the analyzer scans over a  mass range.  Some instruments require seconds to perform a full scan, however this can vary depending on the analyzer. Time-of-flight analyzers, for example, complete analyses in milliseconds or less.

## Mass Analyzers

It  is  clear  from  Chapter  2  that  ESI  and  MALDI  are  quite different  in  terms  of  how  ions  are  generated.  ESI  creates  ions  in  a continuous stream from charged droplets under atmospheric pressure conditions, for this reason quadrupoles present a well-suited analyzers for ESI since they are tolerant of relatively high pressures (~10 -5 torr)  and  are  capable  of  continuously  scanning  the  ESI  ion stream.  MALDI,  on  the  other  hand,  generates  ions  from  short, nanosecond laser pulses and is readily compatible with time-of-flight mass analysis, which measures precisely timed ion packets such as those generated from a laser pulse. The most common analyzers are discussed  in  this  section  with a description  of their respective advantages and disadvantages.

## Quadrupoles

Quadrupole  mass  analyzers  ( Figure  3.4 )  have  been  used with EI sources since the 1950's and are still the most common mass analyzers in existence today. Interestingly, quadrupole mass analyzers have found new utility in their capacity to interface with ESI and APCI. Quadrupoles offer three main advantages. They tolerate relatively  high  pressures.  Secondly,  quadrupoles  have  a  significant mass range with  the  capability  of  analyzing  up  to  an m/z of  4000, which is useful because electrospray ionization of proteins and other biomolecules commonly produce charge distributions from m/z 1000 to  3500. Finally, quadrupole mass spectrometers are relatively lowcost  instruments.  Given  the  complementary  features  of  ESI  and quadrupole mass analyzers, it is not surprising that the first successful commercial electrospray  instruments were coupled with quadrupole mass analyzers.

Quadrupole  mass  analyzers  are  connected  in  parallel  to  a radio frequency (RF) generator and a DC potential. At a specific RF field, only ions of a specific m/z can pass through the quadrupoles as shown in Figure 3.4 , where only the ion of m/z 100 is detected. In all three  cases  the  DC  and  RF  fields  are  the  same.  Therefore,  by scanning the RF field a broad m/z range (typically 100 to 4000) can be achieved in approximately one second.

## Mass Analyzers

A cross-section of a quadrupole mass analyzer taken as it analyzes for m/z 100, 10, and 1000, respectively. It is important to note that both the DC and RF fields are the same in all three cases and only ions with m/z = 100 (top example) traverse the total length of the quadrupole and reach the detector; the other ions are filtered out.

## Tandem Mass Spectrometry (MSIMS) with a triple quadrupole

Figure  3.5.  A  triple  quadrupole ESI  mass  spectrometer possesses  ion selectionand fragmentation capabilities allowing for tandem mass spectra.

<!-- image -->

To perform tandem mass analysis with a quadrupole instrument, it is necessary to place three quadrupoles in series. Each quadrupole has a separate function: the first quadrupole (Q1) is used

to scan across a preset m/z range and select an ion of interest. The second quadrupole (Q2), also known as the collision cell, focuses and transmits the ions while introducing a collision gas (argon or helium) into  the  flight  path  of  the  selected  ion.  The  third  quadrupole  (Q3) serves to analyze the fragment ions generated in the collision cell (Q2) ( Figure  3.5 ).  A  stepwise  example  of  collision-induced  dissociation (CID) is shown in Figure 3.2 .

## Quadrupole Ion Trap

The ion trap mass analyzer shown in Figure 3.6 (roughly the size  of  a  tennis  ball)  was  conceived  at  the  same  time  as  the quadrupole  mass  analyzer  by  the  same  person,  Wolfgang  Paul. Incidentally, the physics behind both analyzers is similar. However, in an ion trap, rather than passing through a quadrupole analyzer with a superimposed radio frequency field, the ions are trapped in a radio frequency quadrupole field. One method of using an ion trap for mass spectrometry involves generating ions internally with EI, followed by mass analysis. Another, more popular, method of using an ion trap for mass  spectrometry  involves  generating  ions  externally  with  ESI  or MALDI  and  using  ion  optics  for  sample  injection  into  the  trapping volume. The quadrupole ion trap typically consists of a ring electrode and two hyperbolic endcap electrodes ( Figure 3.6 ). The motion of the ions induced by the electric field on these electrodes allows ions to be trapped or ejected from the ion trap. In the normal mode, the radio frequency  is  scanned  to  resonantly  excite  and  therefore  eject  ions through small holes in the endcap to a detector. As the RF is scanned to  higher  frequencies,  higher m/z ions  are  excited,  ejected,  and detected.

A particularly useful feature of ion traps is that it is possible to isolate  one  ion  species  by  ejecting  all  others  from  the  trap.  The isolated ions can subsequently be fragmented by collisional activation and the fragments  detected.  The  primary  advantage  of  quadrupole ion  traps  is  that  multiple  collision  induced  dissociation  experiments can be performed quickly without having multiple analyzers, such that real  time  LC-MS/MS is now routine. Other important advantages of quadrupole ion traps include their compact size, and their ability to trap and accumulate ions to provide a better ion signal.

Quadrupole ion traps have been utilized in several applications ranging from electrospray ionization MS n  ( Figure 3.6 ) of biomolecules to their more recent interface with MALDI. MS n  allows for  multiple  MS/MS  experiments  to  be  performed  on  subsequent fragment ions, providing additional fragmentation information. Yet, ion traps most important application has been in the characterization of proteins. LC-MS/MS  experiments are performed on proteolytic digests which provide both MS  and  MS/MS  information. This information  allows  for  protein  identification  and  post-translational modification characterization. The mass  range (~4000 m/z ) of commercial LC-traps is well matched to m/z values generated from the electrospray ionization of peptides and the resolution allows for charge state identification of multiply-charged peptide ions. Quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometers can analyze peptides from a tryptic digest present at the 20-100 fmol level. Another asset of the ion trap technique for peptide analysis is the ability to perform multiple stages  of  mass  spectrometry,  which  can  significantly  increase  the amount of structural information.

## Tandem Mass Spectrometry (MSIMS) with an ion trap

Figure 3.6.  Ions inside a 3D ion trap mass analyzer can be analyzed to produce a mass spectrum, or a particular ion can be trapped inside and made to undergo collisions to produce fragmentation information.

## Linear Ion Trap

A linear ion trap differs from the 3D ion trap ( Figure 3.7 ) as it confines ions along the axis of a quadrupole mass analyzer using a two-dimensional (2D) radio frequency (RF) field with potentials applied to  end electrodes.  The primary advantage of a linear trap over the 3D trap is the larger analyzer volume lends itself to a greater dynamic range and an improved range of quantitative analysis.

Figure 3.7. A linear ion trap mass  analyzer confines  the ions along the axis of  quadrupoles using a 2D radio frequency and stopping potentials on the end electrodes.

<!-- image -->

Given the power of the ion trap the major limitations of this device that keep it from being the ultimate tool for pharmacokinetics and  proteomics  include  the  following:  1)  the  ability  to  perform  high sensitivity triple quadrupole-type precursor ion scanning and neutral loss scanning experiments is not possible with ion traps. 2) The upper limit  on  the  ratio  between  precursor m/z and  the  lowest  trapped fragment ion is ~0.3 (also known as the 'one third rule'). An example of  the  one  third  rule  is  that  fragment  ions  of m/z 900  will  not  be detected below m/z 300, presenting a significant limitation for de novo sequencing of peptides. 3) The dynamic range of ion traps are limited because when too many ions are in the trap, space charge effects diminish the performance of the ion trap analyzer. To get around this, automated scans can rapidly count ions before they go into the trap, therefore  limiting  the  number  of  ions  getting  in.  Yet  this  approach presents a problem when an ion of interest is accompanied by a large background ion population.

## Double-Focusing Magnetic Sector

The earliest mass analyzers separated ions with a magnetic field. In magnetic analysis, the ions are accelerated into a magnetic field  using  an  electric  field.  A  charged  particle  traveling  through  a magnetic field will travel in a circular motion with a radius that depends on the speed of the ion, the magnetic field strength, and the ion's m z / . A  mass  spectrum  is  obtained  by  scanning  the  magnetic  field  and monitoring ions as they strike a fixed-point detector. A major limitation of  magnetic  analyzers  is  their  relatively  low  resolution.  In  order  to improve this, magnetic instruments were modified with the addition of an electrostatic analyzer to focus the ions. These are called doublesector  or  two-sector  instruments.  The  electric  sector  serves  as  a kinetic  energy  focusing  element  allowing  only  ions  of  a  particular kinetic energy to pass through its field irrespective of their mass-tocharge ratio. Thus, the addition of an electric sector allows only ions of uniform kinetic energy to reach the detector, thereby decreasing the kinetic energy spread, which in turn increases resolution. It should be noted that the corresponding increase in resolution does have its costs in  terms  of  sensitivity.  These  double-focusing  ( Figure  3.8 ) mass analyzers are used with ESI, FAB and EI ionization, however they are not widely used today primarily due to their large size and the success of time-of-flight, quadrupole and FTMS analyzers with ESI and MALDI.

## Time-of-Flight Tandem MS

The linear time-of-flight (TOF) mass analyzer ( Figure 3.9 ) is the  simplest  mass  analyzer.  It  has  enjoyed  a  renaissance  with  the invention of MALDI and its recent application to electrospray and even gas chromatography electron ionization mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Time-of-flight analysis is based on accelerating a group of ions to a detector where all of the ions are given the same amount of energy through an accelerating potential. Because the ions have the same energy, but a different mass, the lighter ions reach the detector first because of their greater velocity, while the heavier ions take longer due to their heavier masses and lower velocity. Hence, the analyzer is called time-of-flight because the mass is determined from the ions' time of arrival. Mass, charge, and kinetic energy of the ion all play a part in the arrival time at the detector.  Since the kinetic energy (KE) of the ion is equal to 1/2 mv 2 , the ion's velocity can be represented as v = d/t = (2KE/m) 1/2 . The ions will travel a given distance d, within a time t, where t is dependent upon the mass-to-charge ratio ( m/z ). In this  equation,  v  =  d/t  =  (2KE/m) 1/2 ,  assuming  that  z  =  1.  Another representation of this equation to more clearly present how mass is determined is m = 2t 2  KE/d 2 where KE is constant.

Figure 3.9. Time-of-flight and time-of-flight reflectron mass analyzers.  The TOF analyzer has virtually unlimited mass range, while the TOF reflectron has mass range up to m/z ~10,000. It should be noted that most detectors have a limited mass range.

<!-- image -->

The time-of-flight (TOF) reflectron ( Figure 3.10 ) is now widely used  for  ESI,  MALDI,  and  more  recently  for  electron  ionization  in GC/MS  applications.  It  combines  time-of-flight  technology  with  an electrostatic mirror. The reflectron serves to increase the amount of time (t)  ions  need to reach the  detector while reducing their kinetic energy  distribution,  thereby  reducing  the  temporal  distribution ï£½ t. Since resolution is defined by the mass of a peak divided by the width

of a peak or m/ ï£½ m (or t/ ï£½ t since m is related to t), increasing t and decreasing ï£½ t  results  in  higher  resolution.  Therefore,  the  TOF reflectron  offers  high  resolution  over  a  simple  TOF  instrument  by increasing the  path  length  and kinetic  energy  focusing through the reflectron.  It should be noted that the increased resolution (typically above  5000)  and  sensitivity  on  a  TOF  reflectron  does  decrease significantly at higher masses (typically above 5000 m/z ).

Another  type  of  tandem  mass  analysis,  MS/MS,  is  also possible  with  MALDI  TOF  reflectron  mass  analyzers.  MS/MS  is accomplished  by  taking  advantage  of  MALDI  fragmentation  that occurs  following  ionization,  or  post-source  decay  (PSD).  Time-offlight instruments alone will not separate post-ionization fragment ions from the same precursor ion because both the precursor and fragment ions have the same velocity and thus reach the detector at the same time. The reflectron takes advantage of the fact that the fragment ions have  different  kinetic  energies  and  separates  them  based  on  how deeply  the  ions  penetrate  the  reflectron  field,  thus  producing  a fragment ion spectrum ( Figure 3.10 and 3.11 ).

Time-of-Flight Reflectron Mass AnalyzerFigure 3.10. A MALDI time-of-flight reflectron mass analyzer and its ability to improve resolution over time-of-flight analysis with the reflectron. The TOF reflectron mass analyzer with an ESI ion source has also gained wide use due to the fast acquisition rates (milliseconds), good mass range (up to ~10,000 m/z ) and accuracy on the order of 5 part per million (ppm).

It is worth noting that ESI is readily adapted to TOF reflectron analyzers,  where  the  ions  from  the  continuous  ESI  source  can  be stored in the hexapole (or octapole) ion guide then pulsed into the TOF analyzer.  Thus,  the  necessary  electrostatic  pulsing  creates  a  time zero from which the TOF measurements can begin.

## MALDI with Time-of-Flight Analysis

In the  initial stages  of  MALDI-TOF  development,  these instruments had relatively poor resolution which severely limited their accuracy. An innovation that has had a dramatic effect on increasing the  resolving  power  of  MALDI  time-of-flight  instruments  has  been delayed extraction (DE), as shown in Figure 3.12 . In theory, delayed extraction is a relatively simple means of cooling and focusing the ions immediately after the MALDI ionization event, yet in practice it was initially a  challenge  to  pulse  10,000  volts  on  and  off  within  a nanosecond time scale.  In traditional MALDI instruments, the ions

were  accelerated  out  of  the  ionization  source  immediately  as  they were formed. However, with delayed extraction the ions are allowed to  'cool'  for  ~150  nanoseconds  before  being  accelerated  to  the analyzer.  This  cooling  period  generates  a  set  of  ions  with  a  much smaller  kinetic  energy  distribution,  ultimately  reducing  the  temporal spread of ions once they enter the TOF analyzer. Overall, this results in increased  resolution and  accuracy.  The  benefits  of  delayed extraction significantly diminish with larger macromolecules such as proteins (&gt;30,000 Da).

## Delayed Extraction with MALDI

resolution is dramatically improved

Figure 3.12. Delayed extraction (DE) is a technique applied in MALDI which allows ions to be extracted from the ionization source after a cooling period of ~150 nanoseconds. This cooling period effectively narrows the kinetic energy distribution of the ions, thus providing higher resolution than in continuous extraction techniques.

## Quadrupole Time-of-Flight MS

Quadrupole-TOF  mass  analyzers  are  typically  coupled  to electrospray  ionization  sources  and  more  recently  they  have  been successfully  coupled  to  MALDI.  The  ESI  quad-TOF  ( Figure  3.13 ) combines  the  stability of a quadrupole  analyzer  with  the  high efficiency, sensitivity, and accuracy of a time-of-flight reflectron mass analyzer. The quadrupole can act as any simple quadrupole analyzer to scan across a specified m/z range.  However, it can also be used to  selectively  isolate  a  precursor  ion  and  direct  that  ion  into  the

collision  cell.  The  resultant  fragment  ions  are  then  analyzed  by  the TOF reflectron mass analyzer. Quadrupole-TOF exploits the quadrupole's ability to select a particular ion and the ability of TOF-MS to achieve simultaneous and accurate measurements of ions across the full mass range. This is in contrast to conventional analyzers, such as tandem quadrupoles, which must scan over one mass at a time. Quadrupole-TOF  analyzers  offer  significantly  higher  sensitivity  and accuracy  over  tandem  quadrupole  instruments  when  acquiring  full fragment mass spectra.

The quadrupole-TOF instrument can use either the quadrupole or TOF analyzers independently or together for tandem MS experiments. The TOF component of the instrument has an upper m/z limit in excess of 10,000. The high resolving power (~10,000) of the TOF also enables good mass measurement accuracy on the 10 ppm level. Due to its high accuracy and sensitivity, the ESI quad-TOF mass  spectrometer  is  being  incorporated  into  both  proteomics  and pharmacokinetics problem solving.

## Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance MS (FTMS)

FTMS  is  based  on  the  principle  of  monitoring  a  charged particle's orbiting motion in a magnetic field ( Figure 3.14-15 ). While the ions are orbiting, a pulsed radio frequency (RF) signal is used to excite them.  This  RF  excitation allows  the ions to produce  a detectable image current by bringing them into coherent motion and enlarging the radius of the orbit.  The image current generated by all

of the ions can then be Fourier-transformed to obtain the component frequencies  of  the  different  ions,  which  correspond  to  their m z / . Because the frequencies can be obtained with high accuracy, their corresponding m/z can  also  be  calculated  with  high  accuracy.  It  is important  to  note  that  a  signal  is  generated  only  by  the  coherent motion of ions under ultra-high vacuum conditions (10 -11  - 10 -9  Torr). This signal must be measured for a minimum amount of time (typically 500  ms  to  1  second)  to  provide  high  resolution.  As  pressure increases, signal decays faster due to loss of coherent motion due to collisions (e.g. in ~ &lt;150 ms) and does not allow for high resolution measurements ( Figure 3.14 ).

## Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass analyzer

Figure 3.14. A side view of an FTMS instrument with ESI source. The ESI ions are formed and guided into the analyzer cell using a single stage quadrupole rod assembly.  The analyzer cell rests in the superconducting magnet (diagram courtesy IonSpec Corporation).

<!-- image -->

Ions  undergoing  coherent  cyclotron  motion  between  two electrodes  are  illustrated  in Figure  3.14 .  As  the  positively  charged ions  move  away  from  the  top  electrode  and  closer  to  the  bottom electrode, the electric field of the ions induces electrons in the external circuit to flow and accumulate on the bottom electrode. On the other half of the cyclotron orbit, the electrons leave the bottom electrode and accumulate on the top electrode as the ions approach. The oscillating flow  of  electrons  in  the  external  circuit  is  called  an  image  current. When a mixture of ions with different m/z values are all simultaneously accelerated, the image current signal at the output of the amplifier is

a composite transient signal with frequency components representing each m/z value.  In short, all of the ions trapped in the analyzer cell are excited into a higher cyclotron orbit, using a radio frequency pulse. The composite transient image current signal of the ions as they relax is acquired by a computer and a Fourier transform is used to separate out the individual cyclotron frequencies. The effect of pressure on the signal and resolution is demonstrated in Figure 3.16 .

## Ion Cyclotron Motion with Fourier transformation

<!-- image -->

In addition to high resolution, FTMS also offers the ability to perform  multiple  collision  experiments  (MS n ).  FTMS  is  capable  of ejecting all but the ion of interest. The selected ion is then subjected to a collision gas (or another form of excitation such as laser light or electron capture) to induce fragmentation. Mass analysis can then be carried out on the fragments to generate a fragmentation spectrum. The high resolution of FTMS/MS also yields high-accuracy fragment masses.

## Protein isotope pattern from an FTMS

<!-- image -->

FTMS  is  a  relative  neophyte  to  biomolecular  analysis,  yet many  of  its  advantages  have  become  a  mainstay  of  the  research community, especially the orbitrap mass analyzer. It is now becoming more common to couple ultrahigh resolution (&gt;10 5 ) FTMS to a wide variety of ionization sources, including MALDI, ESI, APCI, and EI. The result of an FTMS analyzer's high resolving power is high accuracy (often at the part per million level) as illustrated for a protein in Figure 3.17 where  individual isotopes can be observed. The  Fourier transform  of  the  ICR  signal  greatly  enhances  the  utility  of  ICR  by simultaneously measuring all the overlaying frequencies produced by

## 3. Mass Analyzers

the ions within the ICR cell. The individual frequencies can then be easily and accurately translated into the ion's m/z .

In general, increasing magnetic field (B) has a favorable effect on performance.  The  Fourier transform of the ICR  signal, by measuring  overlaying  frequencies  simultaneously,  allows  for  high resolution and high mass accuracy without compromising sensitivity. This is in sharp contrast to double sector instruments that suffer from a loss in sensitivity at the highest resolution and accuracy. The highresolution  capabilities  of  FTMS  are  directly  related  to  the  magnetic field of the  FTMS  superconducting  magnet,  with  the  resolution increasing as a linear function of the field. The ion capacity as well as MS/MS  kinetic  energy  experiments  increases  as  a  square  of  the magnetic therefore improving dynamic range and fragmentation data. One challenge in increasing B is the magnetic mirror effect where ion transmission to the inside of magnetic field becomes more difficult due to  magnetic  field  lines.  Also,  manufacturing  high  field  magnets  with larger  bores  and  excellent  field  homogeneity  (in  the  ICR  housing) becomes technically more difficult.

FTMS instrumentation is affected by the magnetic field in the following ways:

| FTMS attribute     | Effect of Magnetic  Field Strength (B)   | What it means:                                                                              |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Resolution  (m/âm) | Directly proportional to  B              | Improves mass accuracy and the  ability to get isotopic resolution on  large macromolecules |
| Kinetic Energy     | Directly proportional to  B 2            | Increases the fragmentation and also  ability to fragment larger  macromolecules            |
| Ion capacity       | Directly proportional to  B 2            | Can store more ions before space-  charge adversely affects  performance                    |

Figure 3.18. Fourier transform ion cyclotron frequency increaseswith magnetic  field strength.

<!-- image -->

The increased frequency improves accuracy as it allows for more measurements to average.

Since ion frequency = K*B*z/m, larger magnetic fields provide a higher frequency for the same m/z , therefore more data points are generated  to  define  the  frequency  more  precisely  which  ultimately increases accuracy ( Figure 3.18 ).

## Quadrupole and Quadrupole Linear Ion Trap FTMS

Quadrupole-FTMS  and  quadrupole  linear  ion  trap-FTMS mass  analyzers  that  have  recently  been  introduced  are  typically coupled to electrospray ionization sources. The quad-FTMS combines the stability of a quadrupole analyzer with the high accuracy of  a  FTMS.  The  quadrupole  can  function  as  a  simple  quadrupole analyzer to scan across a specified m/z range. However, it can also be used to selectively isolate a precursor ion and direct that ion into the collision cell or the FTMS. The resultant precursor and fragment ions can then be analyzed by the FTMS.

Performing MS/MS experiments outside the magnet presents some advantages since high resolution in FTMS is dependent on the presence of high vacuum. MS/MS experiments involve collisions at a transiently high pressure (10 -6  - 10 -7  Torr) that then has to be reduced to  achieve  high  resolution  (10 -10 -  10 -9 Torr).  Performing  MS/MS experiments outside the cell is thus faster since the ICR cell can be

maintained  at  ultra-high  vacuum.  This  results  in  the  newer  hybrid instrument designs being more optimized for coupling FTMS/MS for separation techniques such as LC.

## Orbitrap FTMS

The  orbitrap  is  one  of  the  newest  mass  analyzers,  having been introduced in  the early 2000s.  An Orbitrap ( Figure  3.19 )  is  a high-resolution FTMS that is now commonly used in metabolomics, proteomics,  and  other  fields.  The  instrument  operates  by  using  an electric  field  to  trap  ions  inside  a  cylindrical  ion  trap,  known  as  the Orbitrap. The Orbitrap consists of a central spindle electrode and a surrounding outer electrode that creates a harmonic oscillation of the ions  in the  radial  direction.  The  frequency  of  the  oscillation  is dependent on the mass-to-charge ratio of the ions, allowing for the determination  of  the  mass-to-charge  ratio  of  the  ions  with  high accuracy and resolution.

Figure 3.19. Fourier transform orbitrap mass spectrometer was introduced in the 2000s and has become a popular high resolution mass spectrometer.

To  perform  a  measurement,  a  sample  is  ionized,  and  the resulting ions are injected into the Orbitrap. The ions are then trapped and allowed to oscillate in the electric field. As the ions oscillate, their image  current  induces  a  current  in  the  outer  electrode  that  is measured  by  a  detector. The  resulting signal is then Fourier transformed to obtain the mass spectrum of the sample. The Orbitrap

is capable of measuring mass-to-charge ratios with a resolution of up to 500,000, making it one of the higher resolution mass analyzers.

*Many of these values vary with respect to manufactured instrument.

## Detectors

Once the ions are separated by the mass analyzer, they reach the ion detector ( Figures 3.1 and 3.20-23 ), which generates a current signal from the incident ions. The most used detector is the electron multiplier,  which  transfers  the  kinetic  energy  of  incident  ions  to  a surface  that  in  turn  generates  secondary  electrons.  However,  a variety of approaches ( Table 3.3 ) are used to detect ions depending on the type of mass spectrometer.

## Electron Multiplier

Perhaps the most common means of detecting ions involves an electron multiplier ( Figure 3.20 ), which is made up of a series (12 to 24) of aluminum  oxide  (Al2O3)  dynodes  maintained  at  ever increasing potentials. Ions strike the first dynode surface causing an emission of electrons. These electrons are then attracted to the next dynode  held  at  a  higher  potential  and  therefore  more  secondary electrons are generated.  Ultimately, as  numerous  dynodes  are involved, a cascade of electrons is formed that results in an overall current gain on the order of one million or higher.

## Electron Multiplier

Figure 3.20.  Diagrammaticrepresentation of an electron multiplier and the cascade of electrons that results in a 106 amplification of current in a mass spectrometer.

<!-- image -->

The high energy dynode (HED) uses an accelerating electrostatic field to increase the velocity of the ions. Since the signal on an electron multiplier is highly dependent on ion velocity, the HED serves to increase signal intensity and therefore sensitivity.

## Faraday Cup

A  Faraday  cup  ( Figure  3.21 )  involves  an  ion  striking  the dynode  (BeO,  GaP,  or  CsSb)  surface  which  causes  secondary electrons to be ejected. This temporary electron emission induces a positive charge on the detector and therefore a current of electrons flowing toward the detector. This detector is not particularly sensitive, offering limited amplification of signal, yet it is tolerant of relatively high pressure.

Figure 3.21. Faraday cups convert the striking ion into a current by temporarily  emitting electrons creating a positive charge and simultaneously adsorbing the striking ion.

<!-- image -->

## Photomultiplier Conversion Dynode

The photomultiplier conversion dynode detector ( Figure 3.22 ) is not as commonly used as the electron multiplier, yet it is similar in design  where  the  secondary  electrons  strike  a  phosphorus  screen instead of a dynode. The phosphorus screen releases photons which are detected by the photomultiplier. Photomultipliers also operate like the electron multiplier where the striking of the photon on a scintillating surface result in the release of electrons that are then amplified using the cascading principle. One advantage of the conversion dynode is that the photomultiplier tube is sealed in a vacuum, unexposed to the environment  of  the  mass  spectrometer  and  thus  the  possibility  of

## 3. Mass Analyzers

contamination  is  removed.  This  improves  the  lifetimes  of  these detectors  over  electron  multipliers.  A  five-year  or  greater  lifetime  is typical, and they have a similar sensitivity to the electron multiplier.

## Photomultiplier with conversion dynode

Figure 3.22. Scintillation counting with a conversion dynode and a photomultiplier relies on the conversion of the ion (or electron) signal into light. Once the photon(s) are formed, detection is performed with a photomultiplier.

## Array Detector

An array detector is a group of individual detectors aligned in an  array  format.  The  array  detector,  which  spatially  detects  ions according to their different m z / , has been typically used on magnetic sector mass analyzers. Spatially differentiated ions can be detected simultaneously by an array detector. The primary advantage of this approach is that, over a small mass range, scanning is not necessary and therefore sensitivity is improved.

## Charge (or Inductive) Detector

Charge detectors simply recognize a moving charged particle (an  ion)  through  the  induction  of  a  current  on  the  plate  as  the  ion moves past. A typical  signal  is  shown  in Figure  3.23 .  This  type  of detection is widely used in FTMS to generate an image current of an ion. Detection is independent of ion size and therefore has been used on particles such as whole viruses.

## Detection Charge

## Vacuum in the Mass Spectrometer

All mass spectrometers need a vacuum to allow ions to reach the detector without colliding with other gaseous molecules or atoms. If such collisions did occur, the instrument would suffer from reduced resolution  and  sensitivity.  Higher  pressures  may  also  cause  high voltages to discharge to ground which can damage the instrument, its electronics, and/or the computer system running the mass spectrometer. An extreme leak, basically an implosion, can seriously damage  a  mass  spectrometer  by  destroying  electrostatic  lenses, coating  the  optics  with  pump  oil,  and  damaging  the  detector.  In general, maintaining a good vacuum is crucial to obtaining high quality spectra.

## Vacuum systems

Figure 3.24. A  well-maintained vacuum  is essential to the function of a mass spectrometer.  A couple of the different types of vacuum systems are illustrated.

<!-- image -->

One of  the  first  obstacles  faced  by  the  originators  of  mass spectrometry was coupling the sample source to a mass spectrometer.  The  sample  is  initially  at  atmospheric  pressure  (760 torr)  before  being  transferred  into  the  mass  spectrometer's vacuum (~10 -6 torr), which represents approximately a billion-fold difference in

pressure. One approach is to introduce the sample through a capillary column (GC) or through a small orifice  directly  into  the  instrument. Another  approach  is  to  evacuate  the  sample  chamber  through  a vacuum lock (MALDI) and once a reasonable vacuum is achieved (&lt; 10 -2 torr) the sample can be presented to the primary vacuum chamber (&lt; 10 -5 torr).

A  mass  spectrometer  is  shown  in Figure  3.24 with  three alternative pumping systems. All three systems can produce a very high  vacuum  and  are  all  backed  by  a  mechanical  pump.  The mechanical  pump  serves  as  a  general  workhorse  for  most  mass spectrometers and allows for an initial vacuum of about 10 -3  torr to be obtained.  Once  a  10 -3  torr  vacuum  is  achieved,  the  other  pumping systems,  such  as  diffusion,  cryogenic  and  turbomolecular  can  be activated to obtain pressures as low as 10 -11  torr. Maintaining a good vacuum on a mass spectrometer is critical to its overall performance.

## Overview

The mass analyzer is a critical component to the performance of any mass spectrometer. Among the most commonly used are the quadrupole, triple quadrupole, quadrupole ion trap, time-of-flight, timeof-flight  reflectron,  quadrupole  time-of-flight  reflectron,  orbitrap,  and FTMS. However,  the  list  is  growing  as  more  specialized  analyzers allow for more difficult questions to be addressed. For example, the development of the quad-TOF has demonstrated its superior capabilities in high accuracy tandem mass spectrometry experiments. Once the ions are separated by the mass analyzer they reach the ion detector, which is ultimately responsible for the signal we observe in the mass spectrum.

## Metabolite, Lipid and Peptide Analysis

## Then and Now

This  chapter  examines  some  of  the  practical  aspects (e.g.,  isotopes  and  resolution Figure  4.1 ) of  using  ESI  and MALDI mass spectrometry for metabolites, lipids, peptides, and proteins.  What  is  important  for  mass  spectrometry  today  is  in stark  contrast  to  what  was  important  in  the  past.  In  the  1960s and 1970s biomolecular mass analysis was typically accomplished  by  covalently  adding  protecting  groups  to  make molecules more stable to thermal vaporization. ESI and MALDI largely changed this concept and ushered in a more comprehensive and sensitive era for biomolecule analysis.

<!-- image -->

This is an example of how the resolvingpower can have a dramatic effect on resolving isotopes.

During  a  transition  period  in  the  early  1980s  the  ionization technique  called  fast  atom/ion  bombardment  was  developed  and successfully  used  to  analyze  peptides  and  other  biomolecules. However,  FAB  was  found  to  have  relatively  low  sensitivity  and generated ions  within  a  limited  mass  range.  In  the  late  1980s  ESI and MALDI dramatically improved the sensitivity of mass spectrometry  and  the  ability  to  generate  ions  of  a  wide  variety  of biomolecules. Yet with ESI and MALDI came new considerations for preparing samples to maximize sensitivity, resolution, and accuracy.

Some important characteristics and considerations of performing mass measurements today include quantitation, molecular weight calculation, isotope patterns, ionization characteristics, salt content, sample  purity, calibration/accuracy, resolution,  sensitivity,  solubility,  speed,  matrix  selection  and  matrix preparation.

## Quantitation

One common question about ESI and MALDI is whether the ion intensities correlate to the relative amounts of each component. In  most  cases  MALDI  does  not  provide  this  type  of  information unless the compound  has  been  calibrated  against  an  internal standard.  However,  for  ESI  it  is  possible  to  get  some  quantitative information based on external calibration, although internal calibration  still does  provide  the  best  accuracy. Table  4.1 lists important factors that affect the ability to perform quantitative measurements. For instance, for compounds that have similar mass and functional groups, the relative ion intensities may correspond to their content. The ability of a molecule to become ionized is closely related to its functional groups.  The role of functionality in ionization is  demonstrated  for  two  compounds,  an  amine,  and  an  amide  in Figure  4.2 . Both  are  at  the  same  concentration,  yet  they  have significantly  different  signals  because  of  the  relatively  high  proton affinity of the amine. Another example is shown in Figure 4.3 where excellent linearity is obtained between very similar compounds, the

## 4. Practical Aspects of Metabolite, Lipid and Peptide Analysis

cyclic peptides cyclosporine A and G, because they differ only by a methylene group. Typically, the best quantitation is obtained when a compound  is  calibrated  against  an  internal  standard  structurally similar to the molecule in question.

The signal to noise ratio (S/N) is directly proportional to the square root of the number of scans averaged. More averaging results in less errors associated with random noise.

S/N Î± N 1/2

Signal intensity will fluctuate significantly at low sample amounts, reducing quantitative capability.  MALDI typically provides a less stable signal than ESI and therefore generates bigger errors with less sample. Picomole quantities of material will generally provide good quantitation and with some instrumentation it is possible to go down to the low femtomole level.

Analyzers, such as quadrupole ion traps, have a relatively small dynamic range (~10 3 -10 4 ) and can easily get saturated. Quadrupole analyzers have a larger dynamic signal range (~10 6 ) and are therefore more well suited to quantitative measurements.

ESI has a relatively stable signal and as a result excellent quantitation can be achieved with a minimal amount of averaging.  MALDI is less stable (from laser shot to laser shot) and requires greater care in obtaining quantitative data.

The functional groups on a molecule can drastically affect the ionization properties. For instance, an amine will pick up a proton far more efficiently than an amide. Therefore, to obtain good quantitative data an internal standard with comparable ionization characteristics is desirable.

An internal standard with comparable ionization characteristics to the compound of interest allows for consistent relative signal stability. The best choice is an isotopically labeled internal standard.

## Consistent sample handling

Variations in sampling handling approaches (solvents, mixing, injectingâ¦) can have a significant effect on the quality of quantitative results.

Figure 4.2. The ESI mass spectrum was obtained from an equal amount of each  compound,  illustrating  that  the  ion  intensity  does  not  necessarily correlate to the amount of sample being analyzed.

These two  molecules  differ  by  a single methylene group which makes their ionization properties, for practical purposes, very similar. Cyclosporin G (0.20 ÂµM) was used as an internal standard. Similar results were obtained with ESI and MALDI-MS.

A common calibration method used for endogenous metabolite and pharmacokinetic studies is 'internal standardization' where  a  precise  quantity  of  reference  material  is  'spiked'  into  a sample.  A  requirement  needed  for  internal  standards  is  that  their physicochemical  characteristics  should  be  identical  or  similar  to those of the analyte of interest during the measurement. Traditionally, stable isotope labeled compounds  and structural homologs, or analogs have been used as internal standards. When an internal standard is used, quantitation is typically based on a ratio of  the  analyte  to  the  internal  standard,  multiplied  by  the  known concentration of the internal standard ( Figure 4.3 ). Generally, the

more closely the final concentration of the reference material is to the analyte, the more reliable are the results.

This simple method of quantitation is acceptable if the linearity of the method,  that  is  the  response  factor  or  intensity-of-signal  per  unit concentration,  has  been  demonstrated  to  be  constant  over  the concentration range of both the analyte and internal standard.  While it  is  often  challenging  to  arrive  at  an  appropriate  internal  standard, the  benefit  of  this  standardization  technique  is  that  the  internal standard can be added to a sample early in the analysis and prior to sample  preparation.  Therefore,  if  the  internal  standard  and  analyte have  similar  characteristics,  any  loss  of  the  analyte  during  sample preparation  will be  reflected by  a  concomitant  loss  of  internal standard  but  the  ratio  of  their  concentrations  will  still  reflect  the original  quantity  of  the  analyte.  The  benefits  also  extend  to  the analytical  system,  where  the  absence  of  internal  standard  peaks during a run can lead to accelerated identification of injector errors or other system failures.

Calibration of a method using an external standard has the benefit of allowing  use  of  authentic  reference  material  where  the  reference material  is  used  to  generate  an  external  calibration  curve  for  the batch  of  samples.  The  frequency  of  recalibration  of  the  system depends on the stability of the analytical methods; on an LC-MS/MS quadrupole system, it can be as frequent as twice daily. In general, 'system-suitability standards' or 'QC/QA controls' are also interspersed  in  the  sample  batch  during  analysis.  These  controls serve as internal  process controls that qualify  the  analytical  testing throughout the entire process.

## Calculating Molecular Weight

There  are  three  different  ways  to  calculate  mass  from  the molecular formula:  the average  mass, the monoisotopic  mass, and the nominal mass. Each calculation is used for specific reasons; for instance  average  mass  calculation  is  used  when  the  individual isotopes are not distinguishable ( Figure 4.1 ,  resolution = 200). The monoisotopic mass is calculated when it is possible to distinguish the isotopes  ( Figure 4.1 ,  resolution =  2000). The nominal mass  is  not

often used yet is typically applied to compounds containing the elements C, H, N, O and S and having a mass below 600 Da. Examples are shown in Table 4.2 .

Monoisotopic  mass (exact  mass)  --  The  mass  of  an  ion  for  a  given empirical formula calculated using the exact mass of the most abundant isotope of each element (e.g., carbon-12).

Average  mass --  The  mass  of  an  ion  for  a  given  empirical  formula, calculated using the average atomic weight averaged over all the isotopes for each element.

Nominal  mass --  The  mass  of  an  ion  with  a  given  empirical  formula calculated using the integer mass of the most abundant isotope of each element.

A compound with a formula C60H122N20O16S2 has a monoisotopic mass of 1442.8788, an average mass of 1443.8857 and a nominal mass of  1442.

One of the most important features of a mass spectrometer is resolving power (Chapter 2) which turns out to also be important when  calculating  the  mass  of  a  molecule.  For  example,  if  the isotopes  can  be  distinguished  in  the  mass  spectrum,  the  observed m/z will correspond to the monoisotopic mass. This is illustrated in

Figure  4.1 where  at  a  resolution  of  2000  on  an  electrospray quadrupole instrument there is sufficient resolving power to distinguish  isotopes  on  a  peptide.  FTMS  instruments,  because  of their high  resolving  power,  can  provide  isotopic  distributions  of proteins with mass  above  10,000  Da.  Generally  speaking,  the average  mass  is  a  satisfactory  calculation  for  compounds  above  a mass of 5000 Da while for compounds below 5000 Da, the resolution of  the  instrument  is  an  important  factor  in  determining  which  mass calculation to use.

## Isotope Patterns

Figure 4.1 illustrates how the isotope pattern of an individual molecule, as well as the resolving power of the mass spectrometer, can  impact the mass  spectrum.  A  mass  spectrometer  with  a resolving power of 2000 can resolve the isotopes for ions of at least 2000 Da. Figure 4.1 also demonstrates the effect isotopes can have on  the  observed  molecular  weight.  Compounds  containing  12 C,  1 H, 14 N, and  16 O have isotopes  13 C,  2 H,  15 N,  17 O, and  18 O in relatively low abundance  (1.10%,  0.015%,  0.366%,  0.038%,  and  0.200%, respectively)  yet  these  less  abundant  isotopes  make  a  significant contribution when enough atoms are present.

The  isotope  patterns  are  often  taken  for  granted,  but  they can be a  great  source  of  information.  For  instance,  the  spacing  of the isotopes can tell you about the charge state (e.g. 1/2 spacing = 2 + charge state, 1/3 spacing =  3 +  charge  state).  In  addition,  certain elements have distinct isotope patterns such as chlorine and bromine. Looking at the isotopic patterns in Figure 4.4 ,  note  that  a compound  containing  one  chlorine atom  will have  an isotopic contribution that correlates to a peak having a mass at M + 2, with a height  of  ~32%  of  the  primary  ion.  The  percentage  contribution  for chlorine  and  bromine  will  change  if  more  of  these  halogens  are added to the compound. Observing these isotopes can be a useful confirmation of the presence of these elements.

Figure  4.4.  The  isotope  patterns  associated  with  carbon,  chlorine  and bromine. The chlorine and bromine isotopes produce characteristic patterns that help one readily identify these elements in a compound. For carbon the natural contribution of 1.1% of the 13 C accounts for the isotopic abundance of 13 C at higher numbers of carbons.

Below  3000  Da  the  most  common  isotopic  distribution  that you  will  observe  for  biological  compounds  is  dominated  by  carbon ( Figure 4.4 ) since less abundant isotopes of hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen do not significantly contribute to  the distribution below this mass.  However, sulfur atoms can present a significant contribution as  34 S is abundant at 4.68%.

## Solubility

Sample solubility is critical to obtaining quality data. For instance, if you  are  performing  ESI  on  a  sample  that  has  precipitated  out  of solvent, you will not observe that compound. The solvent or matrix is the  medium  that  allows  your  sample  to  be  transported  to  the  gas

phase. Moreover, solvents often plays an important role in ionization.  For  techniques  like  ESI  and  APCI,  if  your  compound  is not soluble in the solvent,  it will  be  impossible to observe a signal.

Figure  4.5 illustrates  the  dramatic  effect  that  choosing  a  suitable solvent can have on acquiring data.

## Timing

Analyzing the sample as soon as possible after it has been prepared  is  important,  as  it  is  quite  common  for  compounds  to decompose,  react  with  the  solvent  in  a  relatively  short  time,  or enzymatically degrade.  A  problem  associated  with  hydrophobic compounds is loss of the sample to the container's surface. Another phenomenon that has been observed is that a sample solution may even leach some salts or plasticizers from the container. Compounds may also stick to the side of vials, therefore the choice of containers is also important.

## Calibration and Mass Accuracy

Accuracy is  one  of  the  most  important  aspects  of  the  data obtained from  a  mass  spectrometer.  It  is  important  for  compound

identification  and  more  recently,  for  high  accuracy  measurement  of proteolytic peptide  fragments  for  protein  identification. For  high accuracy to be possible one needs an instrument with resolution on the order of ~4000 or higher. For very high accuracy (&lt;5 ppm) it is often  necessary  to  have  an  internal  standard  present  or  at  least some reference compound.

Figure 4.6. An electrospray TOF mass external calibration showing excellent accuracy (typically &lt;0.5 ppm) of the calibration ions.

Standard compounds are used to calibrate a mass spectrometer's  mass  analyzer  with  respect  to  how  it  measures  the m/z ( Figure  4.6 ).  Standards  are  also  used  internally  ( Figure  4.7 ) while running an unknown sample to improve accuracy.  Calibration is  generally  performed  using  a  standard  mixture  that  generates  a reliable source of known ions that cover the mass range of interest. For  instance,  polypropylene  glycols  (PPG's)  have  been  used  as

electrospray  calibrants.  To  remove  the  ambiguity  associated  with the  isotope  peaks  generated  with  polypropylene  glycols,  cesium iodide (CsI) has  also been  used  for calibration or fluorinated phosphonium salts ( Figure  4.6 ).  Fluorinated  compounds are useful because  monoisotopic  fluorine  minimizes  the  isotope  contribution and  therefore makes  the  signals simple to interpret. When  a calibration compound of known mass is measured, it helps determine whether the instrument is running within acceptable error limits.  If  the  instrument  is  off  in  accuracy,  an  adjustment  based  on the calibration compound will allow the instrument to run accurately again.

It  is  important  to  distinguish  between  internal  and  external calibration. External calibration refers to the instrument being calibrated followed by analysis without the presence of a calibrant. It is important to keep instrument and solutions free from contamination. The instrument can mistake impurities that are close in  mass  to  the  calibration  compounds  and  cause  the  instrument  to calibrate incorrectly.

Figure 4.7. The internal standards can be used to obtain high accuracy when  used  with  high  resolution instruments. In this case the spectral data containing the internal standards allows us to get accuracy  to  the  5-ppm  level  or better.

Internal calibration refers to analyses that are performed with a calibrant present and serves to further improve accuracy. 'Acceptable'  levels  of  accuracy  are  highly  dependent  on  the  mass analyzer;  for  a  quadrupole  ~200  ppm  is  acceptable;  for  FTMS  ~5 ppm  is  acceptable  with  external  calibration.  Internal  calibration,

~100 ppm for quadrupoles and &lt;5 ppm for FTMS and TOF analyzers is  acceptable.  The  improvements  in  accuracy  for  TOF  analyzers include  making the flight  tube  from  material  that  has  a  low  thermal expansion coefficient (the flight tube does not change appreciably as a  function  of  temperature).  The  calibration  of  MALDI  TOF  and  ESI quadrupole  mass  spectrometers  often  use  the  standard  mixtures shown in Table 4.3 .

## Sample Purity and Clean Containers

Whether  analysis  is  being  performed  with  MALDI  or  ESI, sample (and solvent) purity maximizes sensitivity. It is true that salts can facilitate ionization for certain compounds such as carbohydrates, however, in general, excessive salt and other contaminants will lead to reduced sensitivity. An effective approach for higher sensitivity ESI-MS is reverse phase liquid chromatography since it separates  compounds  prior  to  analysis.  Two  common methods  ( Figure  4.8 )  of  cleaning  samples  for  MALDI-MS  analysis involve ZipTip TM or cold water washing, both of which are effective

for  salt  removal.  Another  way  we  reduce  salts  on  the  spot  and enhance signal is doing a 1x dilution of the sample on the plate by spotting 0.25uL sample, 0.25uL water and 0.5uL matrix. This seems to  especially  reduce  buffer  effects  for  proteins  submitted  in  buffers such as PBS that can cause suppression.

Generally,  the  more  pure  or  homogenous  a  compound  is, the  better  the  sensitivity  and  quality  of  the  mass  spectral  data.  For example,  electrospray  requires  that  the  sample  be  relatively  free (less  than  10  millimolar  concentration)  of  salts,  buffers,  and  other contaminants because these impurities have a detrimental effect on the electrosprayed droplets and their ability to evaporate. If a droplet cannot  effectively  evaporate  because  of  reduced  vapor  pressure associated with impurities; ion production will be lost. Another effect of  contamination  is  the  loss  of  sensitivity  due  to  the  contaminants' competition for protons/cations in the droplets. Using liquid chromatography as a sample introduction method for ESI-MS is very effective  for  generating  pure  samples  and  therefore  maximizing signal.

Even though  MALDI  is  known  to  be  more  tolerant  of  salts, buffers,  and  impurities,  cleanup  procedures  are  still  useful.  With MALDI, one typically probes the surface with the laser beam until a reasonable  signal  has  been  found.  A  good  signal  is  generated because of the laser beam striking a portion of the probe that has the sample embedded in crystalline matrix. To facilitate sample incorporation and desalting, the sample can be washed clean using a droplet of cold water ( Figure 4.8 ). This method promotes a greater and more uniform ion signal.

Table  4.4 presents an overview of the effect different salts and  detergents  can  have  on  ESI  and  MALDI.  Tris-HCl  (25-50mM) and  ammonium  bicarbonate  (25-50  mM)  are  considered  the  most compatible  buffers  with  mass  spectrometry.  Conveniently,  these buffers are also compatible with enzymes such as Arg-C, Trp, Lys-C, Chymo, and Glu-C.

It can go without saying that containers such as glass or the eppendorf should be clean, however sample containers cleanliness can vary widely from manufacturer to manufacturer. Therefore, it is another source of potential contamination to consider when problem solving. For  example,  plastic  vials leech  contaminants  if  using organic solvents and can therefore interfere with experiments.

## Sensitivity / Saturation

Too  little  or  even  too  much  sample  will  have  a  dramatic effect on the data and can make the difference between a successful and  an  unsuccessful  analysis.  For  example,  if  too  little  sample  is used,  understandably  the  instrument  will  be  unable  to  detect  a signal. If too much is used it can skew the intensity profile and mass accuracy of the ions observed ( Figure 4.9 ). High concentrations can also  make  impurities  appear  to  be  more  dominant  or  even  cause signal suppression. An important point is that higher concentration is not always better and that it is more important to be within the correct range for your instrument.

Figure 4.9. The electrospray mass spectra of three peptides is shown. At 20 ÂµM concentration of peptide 1 the two other peptides can be observed. However, at a 10-fold higher concentration (200 ÂµM) the relatively minor  impurities,  peptides  2  and  3, now appear as major components due to  detector  saturation  of  peptide  1. Peptide 1 is so saturated that the C13 isotope of this peptide appears to be bigger than the 12C.

But what is the 'right' range? The answer is highly dependent on the instrument, sample, and technique. Some instruments of very similar design can vary widely in terms of their dynamic range. However, Table 4.5 provides some general guidelines  for  the  amount  of  sample  required  according  to  the ionization  technique. Table  4.5 converts  a  range  of  concentrations often used in electrospray and MALDI from micromolar (10-100 Âµ M) to milligrams/milliliter with respect to molecular weight. Oligonucleotides  for  example  generate  better  signal  at  the  100uM range versus peptides which typically ionize excellently even at the 10uM  range,  or  lower.  Those  used  for  FAB  analysis  are  also displayed. The concentrations shown are conservative; most instruments will easily  handle significantly lower concentrations. In

general, however, the concentrations listed will produce good signal even in the presence of some salt or other contaminating compounds. In comparing ESI, MALDI, and FAB, Table 4.5 illustrates the improvements that ESI and MALDI offer and why they are so important today.

## Ionization Characteristics

The  types  of  functional  groups  on  a  molecule  will  often determine how a compound should be analyzed. When analyzing a compound by ESI or MALDI, first look for sites on the molecule that can  be  ionized.  Amines  (+),  acids  (-),  and  amides  (+)  represent easily  ionizable  functional  groups,  while  hydroxyl  groups,  esters, ketones,  and  aldehydes  do  not  accept  a  charge  as  easily  and  are therefore  more  difficult  to  ionize,  typically  resulting  in  weak  ion signals. Due to the presence of amide and amine groups, peptides usually  ionize  easily  through  protonation.  Because  peptides  often contain  amino  acid  residues  with  side  chain  carboxyl  groups,  they can  also  be  observed  in  the  negative  ion  mode  by  deprotonation. Some carbohydrates will accept a proton because of the presence of an  amide  bond,  but  in  general  they  form  stable  ions  upon  the addition of a cation other than a proton, such as Na + or K + to form M + Na + and M + K +  ions. Oligonucleotides, proteins, and the myriad of small molecules each have their ionization peculiarities, making the conditions under which analysis is performed all the more important.

## MALDI Matrix Selection and Preparation

The  choice  of  matrix  is  critical  for  MALDI  and,  in  many cases,  will  determine  the  quality  of  the  data  ( Figure  4.10 ). The introduction  of  new  matricies  has  complicated  matrix  selection  and preparation,  yet  at  the  same  time  had  a  tremendous  impact  on sensitivity and accuracy.

Sample  preparation  with  MALDI  involves  dissolving  the sample  into  a  solvent,  such  as  water,  acetone,  or  methanol.  The sample  solution  is  then  added  to  the  matrix,  commonly  a  nicotinic acid  or  cinnamic  acid  derivative,  at  a  ratio  of  approximately  1  part sample to 10,000 parts matrix molecules. Approximately 10 picomoles (1 Âµ l  of  a  10 Âµ M solution) of the sample  is added to  an equal volume of a saturated solution of the matrix. It is important to note  that MALDI  most  commonly  involves  a  solid  matrix  and, therefore, MALDI sample preparation requires that after the sample solution is made up and deposited upon the probe, it is necessary to wait  a  few  minutes  for  complete  evaporation  of  the  solvent  to  form nice crystals and leave a solid mixture of the sample embedded in the matrix.

Figure  4.10.  Cinnamic  acid  is  the  basis  of  many  of  the  common  MALDI matrices. Sample deposition involves placing the sample and matrix onto a probe at a ratio of roughly 10,000 matrix molecules to every sample molecule. The type of matrix is important with regard to the type of compound being analyzed.

The  evaporation  process  for  MALDI  can  be  expedited  by flowing  a  stream  of  nitrogen  or  air  over  the  dissolved  matrix  or  by using a volatile solvent (acetone) if possible. Evaporation can also be expedited by spotting smaller volumes or using concentrating plates like  anchor  chips.  Multisampling  probes  also  quicken  the  analysis time by allowing for many samples to be prepared at once.

## Overview

This  chapter  examines  many  of  the  factors  that  allow  for quality mass  spectral information from ESI and MALDI  mass spectrometers.  Among  the  most  important  of  these  factors  for obtaining signal of high quality are sample solubility, matrix selection, the  ionization  characteristics,  salt  content  and  purity.  Factors  that contribute to data interpretation include the isotope patterns, saturation effects and accuracy.

| 4) What does resolving power  mean in mass spectrometry?                                    | Resolving power is the ability of a mass spectrometer to  separate ions of similar mass-to-charge ratio ( mz) / . High  resolution enables the analyst to resolve isotopic peaks of  high-mass ions. Most commonly, resolving power is  defined as M/âM as shown below and  Figure 4.3 .                                                                                                                     |

| 5) Are there always matrix  peaks in the MALDI mass  spectra?  6) Doyou observe matrix      | Most often below  m/z  500. It is possible for certain analytes  to adjust the analyte-to-matrix ratio to minimize the matrix  interference effect.  No. Since electrospray does not use a matrix, it does not                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 7) Why are cation adducts  predominantly observed in the  mass spectrum of some  molecules? | Some compounds do not form stable protonated molecules  because the charge from the proton can be transferred  onto the molecule and can thus destabilize it.  Alkali  cations can complex to some molecules because the  charge remains localized and does not transfer onto the  molecule (there is no charge destabilization).  Therefore,  the alkali cation adducts of some molecules are more          |
| 8) How can you tell if a peak in  electrospray is singly- or  multiply- charged?            | The spacing in isotope pattern will tell you what the charge  state is.  For instance, if the isotopes are spaced one  m/z  apart, the peak corresponds to a singly charged ion. If the  isotopes are one half  m/z  apart then the peak corresponds  to a doubly charged ion.  If the peaks isotopes are spaced  one third of a  m/z  apart then the peak corresponds to a  triply charged ion.  And so on. |

| 9) Electron ionization (EI) used  to be the most popular  ionization source, why is it not  used as much anymore? | EI requires thermal desorption to vaporize a compound  and many compounds will not survive the high temperature  required for vaporization.  Also, the electron ionization  process is a relatively harsh ionization, and many  molecules will not remain intact once ionized in this way.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 10) Why does having too much  salt in your electrospray sample  cause signal suppression?                         | Electrospray ionization operates by the evaporation of  charged droplets. Too much salt causes vapor pressure to  go down and evaporation is thus inhibited.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 11) Why do heterogeneous  mixtures reduce the sensitivity  of MALDI and electrospray?                             | MALDI and electrospray are both somewhat competitive  ionization techniques in the sense that molecules in  solution or the matrix will compete for protons. Therefore,  the compound with the highest proton affinity will often  dominate the spectrum. This tends to be more the case for  electrospray since the molecules are competing in solution,  while for MALDI many of the molecules are separated in  the matrix solution, therefore reducing competition. |
| 12) Howshould  volatile  samples be analyzed?                                                                     | Volatile samples typically require more traditional ionization  sources such as electron ionization.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 13) How important is it to know  the structure of a compound?                                                     | Structural information is useful in helping the analyst  decide how to perform analyses. For example, an acidic  molecule would be analyzed in negative ionization mode.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 14) Why is it so important to  minimize fragmentation during  ionization?                                         | The problem with obtaining fragment ions is that you can  never be sure that the largest ion that is observed is really  the molecular ion and not a fragment of something bigger.  This is why ESI and MALDI are so useful; in many cases  the ion generated corresponds to the intact molecular ion.                                                                                                                                                                  |

Proteomics  is  very  different  from  metabolomics,  yet  given their  close  technological  association,  I  decided  to  cover  this  very broad  topic  in  a  chapter  with  the  hope  of  covering  some  of  the fundamental  aspects.  First,  I  will  start  with  peptide  and  protein analysis,  followed  by  protein  identification  via  mass  mapping,  and then protein structural analysis. Although on some level they are all intertwined.

## Peptide and Protein Analysis

Peptide  and  protein  analysis  with  electrospray  ionization (ESI)  and  matrix-assisted  laser  desorption/ionization  (MALDI)  is  a very straightforward way to determine molecular weight whether you are  interested  in  confirming  an  identity  or  in  the  initial  stages  of characterizing the structure. For example, what has made the mass analysis  of  peptides  and  proteins  possible  is  the  ability  to  promote their  nondestructive vaporization/ionization with ESI  and MALDI via the addition or removal of protons such as [M + H] + , [M + 2H] 2+ , [M + nH] n+  or [M - H] - , [M - nH] n-( Figure 5.1 ). During the generation of these species it is fortunate that typically little to no fragmentation is observed

by either ESI or MALDI for peptides and virtually no fragmentation is observed for proteins. As a result, the generation of molecular weight information is often unambiguous.

In general, the sensitivity of mass spectrometry is quite good for  proteins  and  peptides.  It  is  possible  to  observe  peptides  at  the attomole  level  or  lower,  while  the  sensitivity  for  protein  analysis  is typically  not  as  good  largely  because  of  the  protein's  larger  size. Proteins strike the detector with lower velocity than smaller molecules, resulting in less signal output. Even so, the sensitivity of MALDI and ESI for proteins is still considered good at the picomole to femtomole level.

In  addition  to  molecular  weight  determination  ( Figure  5.2 ), MALDI and ESI have demonstrated increasing utility in the identification of proteins and protein post-translational modifications. While  complete  and  routine  sequence  determination  through  mass analysis  of  proteins  is  yet  to  be  realized,  it  is  now  possible  to  use proteolytic peptide fragments in combination with database searching  algorithms  to  identify  proteins.  This  is  accomplished  by combining mass spectrometry with enzymatic or chemical digestion ( Figure 5.2 insert ) followed by  mass  analysis  of  the  peptide products  and  database  searching  techniques  (especially  useful  in the post genome age).

MALDI and ESI mass spectrometry has also demonstrated its utility in identifying post-translational  modifications,  as  these modifications  usually  lead  to  a  predictable  change  in  molecular weight. In

addition, electrospray with tandem mass spectrometry is demonstrating a capacity for performing de novo sequencing.

## Peptides and Proteins by MALDI

MALDI  is  useful  for  peptide  and  protein  analysis  for  the  following reasons:

- Â· MALDI allows for high throughput analysis ( Figure 5.3 )
- Â· high sensitivity (in the femtomole range or better)
- Â· tolerance of heterogeneous samples ( Figures 5.4 )
- Â· typically high  accuracy  mass  measurements  can  now  be generated  on  a  MALDI-TOF  reflectron  in  the  mass  range below 3000 m/z or higher with a MALDI Orbitraps and FTMS
- Â· good dynamic range ( Figure 5.5 )

Figure 5.3. MALDI can employ multisample preparation and automated sample analysis. Three different parameters can be used to adjust and monitor autosampling, including laser position, laser intensity, and signal intensity.

Surface-based  ionization  techniques  like  MALDI  allow  for rapid  analyses  primarily  because  both  allow  for  the  preparation  of multiple  samples  simultaneously  using  multi-sample  probes.  The automation of those analyses is becoming increasingly important in proteomics and combinatorial chemistry. These analyses are driven by a computer- controlled  procedure to  monitor the ion signal as a function of laser position and  laser intensity ( Figure 5.3 ). To accomplish this, the computer workstation can automatically adjust  laser  intensity  and

searches  the  sample  well  until  a  signal  (within  the  specified  mass range  and  intensity  threshold)  is  obtained.  Based  on  a  careful preselection of autosampler options, each parameter (laser intensity, search pattern, step size in well, signal intensity, and m/z range) is adjusted to minimize time of analysis and maximize signal quality.

Figure 5.4. MALDI-MS analyses of the same tryptic digest of a protein using sinapinic acid and Î± -cyano matrices. Different matrices can provide significantly different MALDI  results on depending on the sample type.

<!-- image -->

For MALDI  analysis of relatively small molecules and peptides  (400  Da  -  1000  Da),  2,5-dihydroxybenzoic  acid  (DHB) matrix produces less interference than other matrices. Matrices such as Î± -cyano-4-  hydroxycinnamic  acid  ( Î± -cyano)  give  a  high  matrix background although they are particularly  good  for  generating  ions above 700 Daltons. For peptides generated by enzymatic digestion, Î± -cyano is often the matrix of choice. 3,5-dimethoxy-4hydroxycinnamic  acid  (sinapinic  acid),  another  common  matrix,  is most  commonly  used  for  whole  protein  analysis.  Most  matrices reported  to  date  have  been  acidic,  but  basic

matrices  have  also  been  introduced,  such  as  2-amino-4-methyl-5nitropyridine and trihydroxyacetophenone (THAP), which extends the utility  of  MALDI  to  acid-sensitive  peptides,  proteins,  or  other  acidsensitive  compounds.  Interestingly,  different  matrices  can  provide dramatically different results on the same sample ( Figure 5.4 ).

## MALDI Sample Preparation Procedures Whole

## proteins

- Â· A  saturated  solution  of  sinapinic  acid  can  be  prepared  in acetonitrile, water and TFA (50/50 acetonitrile/water with 0.1% TFA) or acetonitrile/water/TFA=1:1:0.1 and vortexed for complete  mixing.  The  solution  is  ready  for  use  when  the undissolved solid settles.
- Â· Place 0.5 Âµ L protein solution (1-10 pmol/ Âµ L)  directly  on  plate and then add 0.5 Âµ L matrix solution.
- Â· Perform on-plate wash with 2 Âµ L nanopure H20 when sample is salty or buffers were used.

## Protein digests

- Â· Typical  in-solution  digest  ratios  are  1:20  -  1:50  (enzyme weight : protein weight).
- Â· Digestion conditions include mixing 5.0 Âµ L of 1mg/mL denatured protein with 0.25 Âµ L trypsin (0.1 mg/mL), 7.5 Âµ L 200 mM NH4HCO3 buffer, and 6 Âµ L H2O allowing to digest at 37Â° C overnight.
- Â· In preparation for MALDI analysis, deposit 0.5 Âµ L of proteoltyic peptide  solution  (~1  pmol/ Âµ L)  on  plate  and  then  immediately add 0.5 Âµ L matrix solution.

Using the dry drop method of sample crystallization, 0.1 to 1.0  picomole  are  introduced  onto  a  MALDI  plate,  after  which  an equal amount of matrix solution is added to the sample. The mixture is  then  set  to  dry  at  room  temperature  or  placement  in  a  37Â°C incubator can assist sample drying. Washing the dried sample/matrix with  cold  water  can  serve  to  remove  contaminants  like  salts  and detergents.  An  example  of  the  results  of  washing  the  sample  after it  has  been  deposited  on  the

matrix is shown in Figure 5.5 . It is worth noting that water wash of a peptide mix can cause loss of hydrophilic peptides.

## On-Plate Sample Wash

As  can  be  seen  from Figure  5.5 ,  on-plate  washes  with  cold water  can  be  quite  effective  for  removing  salts  from  MALDI matrix  solutions. What follows is a simple washing procedure.

- Â· Deposit 0.5 Âµ L of the analyte followed by 0.5 Âµ L matrix* and dry.
- Â· Load the sample and analyze it. Check magnified crystal appearance.
- Â· If results and/or crystals are of poor quality, pipette 2-3 Âµ L of distilled water on top of the sample.
- Â· Allow the droplet to stand for ~30 seconds to 1 minute.
- Â· Pipette the water droplet in and out a few times to wash the matrix solution surface.
- Â· Pipette the water off the sample, trying to remove as much as possible.  Add a small amount of matrix, if necessary.
- Â· Allow to dry and analyze. The wash steps can be repeated, if necessary, but do not add matrix more than once.

*Note:  we  find  that  commercially  available Î± -cyano  matrix  to typically be  of low  purity, a hot ethanol  percepitation  can enhance their performance. You will also notice that the Î± -cyano now is a bright yellow color instead of brown.

## ZipTipâ¢ Sample Wash

Another  popular  approach  for  cleaning  samples  prior  to analyzing  them  by  MALDI  or  electrospray  is  using  a  ZipTipâ¢. ZipTipâ¢ pipette tips are 10 Âµ L (P-10) pipette tips with a bed of resin fixed  at  the  end  of  each  one  such  that  there  is  no  dead  volume. ZipTipâ¢  Pipette  Tips  are  useful  for  concentrating,  desalting,  and fractionating picomole amounts of peptide, protein, or oligonucleotide samples prior to analysis. In operation, ZipTips are affixed to a single or multi-channel pipette. Sample is aspirated and dispensed through the  tip  to  bind,  wash,  and  elute  the  analyte(s)  of  interest.  The concentrated, purified sample is precisely eluted in 1-4 Âµ L of eluant. The working volume range  of a  ZipTipâ¢  is  between  1  to  100 Âµ L and availability  includes  C18 and C4

resins.  The  maximum molecular weight of a  polypeptide which can be processed in ZipTipâ¢ C18 is typically 50,000 Da and each tip can only  be  used  to  concentrate  and  desalt  a  sample  once,  which  is performed  in  about  a  minute.  For  electrospray  mass  spectrometry the appropriate eluant for peptides is 50% ACN/0.1% TFA or 0.1% formic acid. For proteins 75% MeOH/0.1% TFA or 0.1% formic acid. Elution  volumes  for  ZipTipâ¢  Pipette  Tips  are  typically  2-4 Âµ L.  A minimum  sample  amount  for  ZipTipâ¢  C18  is  approximately  30 femtomoles  of  ACTH  or  angiotensin.  In  general,  1  pmol  of  sample should  provide  an  adequate  signal.  Recoveries  of  75%  are  typical for concentrations above 5 pmol/ Âµ L. At concentrations of 0.25 to 2.5 pmol/ Âµ L, recoveries of 45-50% have been observed.

Accuracy  is  also  important  in  peptide  and  protein  analysis. MALDI mass analysis ( Figures  5.2-5.7 )  is  typically  performed  with time-  of-flight  (TOF)  on  proteins  or  TOF-reflectron  analyzers  on peptides  with  resolving  capabilities  on  the  order  of  400  to  10,000 respectively and accuracy ranging from Â±0.2% to 0.001% respectively. The resolution and accuracy depend upon the type of instrument  being  used  (e.g.  low  resolution  TOF  versus  a  higher resolution TOF reflectron), the presence

of an internal standard, buffers, salts, contaminants, the size/type of peptide/protein, and the selection of matrix material.

Figure 5.6. MALDI and direct infusion ESI-TOF of a BSA tryptic digest illustrates MALDI utility  for  mixture  analysis.  ESI  mass  spectral  data  of  the  same  digest  gave  significant signal  suppression  of  the  ions.  However,  ESI  can  more  easily  be  coupled  with  LC separation approaches which dramatically improves its performance for mixtures.

The data demonstrates the simultaneously acquisition of ions of significantly differing size.

Another  important  feature  for  protein/peptide  analysis  is mass range ( Figure 5.7 ). MALDI-TOF can routinely analyze compounds  from  a  mass  of  700  to  200,000  Daltons  or  greater whereas MALDI-TOF reflectron is useful up to Ë5000 m/z .  The  fact that  MALDI  predominantly  generates  ions  that  are  singly  charged makes  it  easy  to  identify  individual  peptides  or  proteins.  MALDI  is also  the  most  reliable  technique  for  analyzing  glycoproteins,  where the broadness in their peaks reflects the carbohydrate heterogeneity in the proteins ( Figures 5.8) .

## Peptides and Protein by Electrospray

MALDI and ESI represent  very  different  types  of  ionization sources for  peptide  and  protein  analysis,  with  each  having  specific advantages. Perhaps  the most  important of these advantages include MALDI's ability to handle complex mixtures directly while ESI best  handles  mixtures  when  interfaced  with  liquid  chromatography. In the low mass range, MALDI matrix interference effects measurements below m/z 700 making ESI more desirable. Another consideration  is  that  ESI  is  a  softer  ionization  method  and  is  more suitable  for  the  analysis  of  noncovalent  complexes.  For  protein analysis,  ESI  analysis  also  tends  to  provide  better  resolution  and accuracy since the measurements are performed on multiply charged  species  in  a  region  (below m/z 3000)  where  the  mass analyzer has high resolving power ( Figure 5.9 ).

## Peptides and Protein by Electrospray

Figure  5.9.  A  direct  comparison  of  peptide  and  protein  data  obtained  from  ESIquadrupole  and  MALDI-TOF  mass  spectrometers.  The  data  for  the  peptide  is  quite comparable,  while  the  extra broadness  of  the  peak  associated  with  the  protein MALDI-TOF  spectrum  reflects  its  lower  resolution  and  lower  accuracy  in  the  higher mass range. The ESI protein data is generated from multiply charged ions below m/z 3000.

<!-- image -->

ESI is  also  useful  for  peptide  and  protein  analysis  for  the  following reasons:

- Â· compatibility with liquid chromatography
- Â· compatibility with tandem mass analyzers
- Â· high sensitivity (subpicomole with nanoESI)
- Â· allows for multiple charging and therefore the analysis of proteins with limited m/z range analyzers
- Â· multiple charging allows for more complete fragmentation with collision-induced dissociation (CID).

As with  MALDI,  the  electrospray  ionization  of  peptides  and proteins involves the addition of a proton or multiple protons. Sample preparation is achieved by dissolving the sample in a protic volatile solvent  system  that  is  relatively  homogeneous  and  contains  less than one millimolar concentration of salt, although higher concentrations have been used (such as the volatile buffer NH4Ac at 100 mM). However, some salts (alkali and alkaline) and phosphate buffers  are  more  detrimental  to  signal  due  to  signal  suppression. Because of the good mass accuracy/stability associated with quadrupole analyzers and because ESI can be easily interfaced with liquid chromatography, electrospray is often the method of choice for peptides.  (Sample spectra

shown  in Figures  5.10-5.12) . Moreover,  since  ESI  has  similar sensitivity,  there  are  only  a  few  preparation  procedures  and  ESI instruments tend to provide higher resolution/accuracy, it is generally the method of choice.

## Multiple Charging

Another  important  feature  of  electrospray  is  its  ability  to generate multiply-charged species. Multiple charging makes it possible to observe large proteins with mass analyzers that have a relatively  small m/z range. In addition,  observing multiple peaks for the  same  peptide  allows  one  to  make  multiple  molecular  weight calculations  from  a  single  spectrum.  Thus,  one  can  average  these values and obtain a more accurate molecular weight. The question often  arises,  especially  concerning  the  analysis  of  peptides  and proteins, "How is the charge state of the observed ion determined?" This  is  accomplished  from  the  isotope  pattern  or  using  adjacent charge states ( Figures 5.10 and 5.11 ).

Figure 5.10. The question of whether a peptide (or any molecule) observed is singly or multiply charged can be addressed in a several ways. The spacing between the isotopes is  reliable in that if isotopes are separated by one mass unit, the charge is 1+, if by  1 /2 mass units,  the  charge  is  2+,  if  by 1 / 3 , the  charge  is  3+,  and  so  on.

<!-- image -->

In the spectrum in Figure 5.10 , two peaks are seen, one at m/z 1978 and another at m/z 990. It is often possible to look at the isotopic  distribution  of  the  ions.  One  mass  unit  separation  at m z / 1978 and  1 /2 mass unit separation at m z / 990 correspond to the 1+ and  2+  charge  states,  respectively.  The  resolving  power  of  the common quadrupole electrospray mass spectrometers only allow for distinguishing between singly and doubly-charged species.

Fortunately, as bigger peptides and proteins are analyzed, a distribution of multiply charged ions is obtained ( Figure 5.11 ). Even though  one  cannot  identify  the  individual  charge  states,  from  the isotopic pattern, unless using a high resolution FTMS instrument, the charge state can be deduced from distribution. Figure 5.11 illustrates the results of two computer-generated  deconvolution calculations.

Figure 5.11. Electrospray mass spectra with the deconvoluted molecular weight spectrum of egg white lysozyme and bovine serum albumin (BSA).

<!-- image -->

Another advantage of generating multiply-charged ions with electrospray is that multiply-charged peptide ions tend to give more complete  fragmentation spectra. This has become  increasingly important for de novo sequencing of peptides and protein identification.

One of the limitations of ESI in comparison to MALDI is its lower sensitivity. However, this has been overcome with the commercial introduction of nanoelectrospray ionization sources. NanoESI is a slight variation on ESI such that the spray needle has been made very small and positioned very close to the entrance of the mass spectrometer. The end result is increased efficiency which greatly  reduces  the  amount  of  sample  needed.  The  flow  rates  for nanoESI are on the order  of  tens  of  nanoliters  per  minute  and  the droplets  are  smaller  than  with  normal  ESI.  Since  the  droplets  are smaller with nanoESI, the amount of evaporation necessary to obtain ion  formation  is  much  less.  As  a  consequence,  nanoESI  is  more tolerant of salts and  other  impurities  because  less  evaporation means the  impurities  are  not  concentrated  down  as  much  as  they are in ESI.

Figure 5.12. ESI mass spectrum of a IgG antibody with averaged molecular weight = 149,599 Â± 12 Da. Adapted from Feng, R; Konishi, Y. 'Analysis of Antibodies and  Other Large Glycoproteins in the Mass Range of 150000-200000 Da by Electrospray  Ionization  Mass  Spectrometry', Analytical  Chemistry , 1992,  64:20902095.

ESI can also be applied to larger proteins. In fact, one of the largest proteins observed with ESI-MS has been with an IgG ( Figure 5.12 ).  However, direct analysis of these as well as glycoproteins by electrospray provides only limited information and requires very high purity because  excessively heterogeneous  compounds  produce complicated spectra due to multiple charging, often making interpretation difficult or impossible. In addition, sample heterogeneity  will often reduce  instrument  sensitivity via signal suppression. In general electrospray is not the method of choice and MALDI is typically used for the analysis of glycoproteins ( Figure 5.8 ).

## LC/MS

Another important feature of ESI-MS with regard to peptide and protein analysis is its ability to directly analyze compounds from aqueous or aqueous/organic solutions, a feature that has established the technique as a convenient mass detector for liquid chromatography (LC) ( Figure 5.13) .  ESI or nanoESI combined with quadrupole or ion trap analyzers allow for MS analysis at flow rates ranging  from  2mL/min  to  50nL/min,  respectively.  The  lower  flow rates  allow  for  high  sensitivity  measurements,  such  as  in  protein digest  analysis,  and  the  high  flow  rates  allow  for  high  throughput applications.

## Declustering

As previously described, ESI induces ion formation from the generation  of  small-charged  droplets.  Once  ions  are  formed,  they are  subject  to  collisions  as  they  enter  the  mass  analyzer.  These collisions can decluster aggregates, induce fragmentation, and change the charge states by removing protons. The kinetic energy of the  ions  can  be  adjusted  to  allow  for  some  control  over  source fragmentation. This energy can be adjusted by varying the electrospray  declustering  or  fragmentation  potential.  A  diagram  of the orifice is shown in Figure 5.14 . However, it should be pointed out that  this  design  is  variable  depending  on  the  instrument,  yet  the same effect is observed in virtually all electrospray mass spectrometers. The  energy  of the ions entering the orifice is determined  by  the  voltage  applied  to  the  orifice;  the  higher  the energy, the more fragmentation is observed. In addition to inducing peptide fragmentation,  increasing  the  declustering  potential  can cause the charge distribution of a protein to change. This is related to the  greater  collision-causing  protons  being  stripped  from  the protein,  and  thus  a  shift  in  the  charge  state  distribution  occurs. Figure  5.14 demonstrates  that  at  a  high  declustering  potential, protons are stripped from egg white lysozyme to produce a charge distribution completely  different from  one  observed  at  a  lower

potential.

Figure  5.14.  Orifice-induced  collisions  are  controlled  by  the  potential  between  the orifice  and  the  quadrupole  mass  analyzer.  The  variation  of  this  potential  can  affect sensitivity,  the  ability  to  observe  noncovalent  interactions,  fragmenation,  and  charge state.  The potential difference between the orifice and the quadrupole affects the energy of collisions prior to  mass analysis. Electrospray mass spectra of egg white lysozyme at two  different  orifice  (declustering)  potentials  demonstrates  that  at  higher  potentials, protons  can  be  stripped from the protein thereby shifting the charge state distribution.

<!-- image -->

Another  interesting  aspect  of  the  ESI  source  is  that  it  can induce  fragmentation  of  small  peptides  typically  below  a  mass  of 3000  Da.  In  relation  to  peptide/protein  analysis,  the  declustering potential  allows  for  peptides  to  be  fragmented,  thus  allowing  for sequencing information to  be  obtained. Figure  5.15 illustrates  how sequence information was obtained on a peptide simply by increasing this potential. A drawback of the application is that it can only  be  used  on  very  pure  samples;  if  the  samples  are  not  pure  it may be easy to mistake an impurity for a fragment ion. When using orifice-induced  fragmentation,  identifying  true  fragment  ions  versus impurities is difficult. This problem can be  overcome with the use of a tandem mass spectrometer. Sample purity is not as significant an issue with a tandem mass spectrometer since an ion of interest can be  isolated  even  in  the  presence  of  several  other  ions  (peptides). Once the ion of  interest  is  isolated,  it  can  be  exposed  to  collisions and  the  resultant  fragment  ions  can  be  mass  analyzed.  Tandem mass  analysis and the specific applications of tandem mass spectrometry to peptides are described in the following section.

Figure  5.15.  Collisions  at  the  orifice  can  be  useful  for  obtaining  structural  information. The collisions  of  this peptide, H-[ISMSEEDLLNAK]-OH, have resulted in  the formation of  fragment  ions  from  the  N-terminal  directly  corresponding  to  its  sequence.  It  is important  to  note  that  this  is  not  a  tandem  mass  spectrometry  experiment  and  the fragment ions were generated as the ions entered the mass analyzer.

## Peptide and Protein Analysis Overview

Mass spectrometry techniques such as ESI and MALDI have changed  the  way  biochemists  are  approaching  the  challenges  of protein/peptide analysis. The  availability of these  sensitive and gentle

ionization  methods  has  made  it  possible  to  analyze  proteins  and peptides  through  a  range  of  available  mass  analyzers  including TOFs,  triple  quadrupoles,  quardupole  ion  traps,  FTMS,  and  hybrid instruments. Furthermore, MS is now routinely used as a fundamental tool for identifying proteins.

## Protein Mass Mapping

Mass spectrometry has rapidly become  one of the most important tools for the identification of proteins ( Figure 5.16 ) largely because of the completion of many genome sequences. Using ESI or MALDI-MS, intact proteolytic peptides can be analyzed, and their masses  accurately  measured.  Based  on  this  information,  proteins can  readily  be  identified  using  a  methodology  called  protein  mass mapping  or  peptide  mass  mapping,  in  which  these  measured masses  are  compared  to  predicted  values  derived  from  protein databases.  Further  sequence  information  can  also  be  obtained  by fragmenting individual peptides in tandem  MS  experiments.  In addition,  large  scale  changes  in  protein  expression  levels  (protein profiling)  between  two  different  samples  can  be  assessed  using quantitative  tools  such  as  two-dimensional  gel  electrophoresis  (2DGE) or stable isotope labeling in conjunction with mass spectrometric measurement.

## Peptide Mass Mapping

Protein identification has traditionally been accomplished by subjecting proteolytic digests to high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) followed by N -terminal (Edman) sequencing and/or  amino  acid  analysis  of  the  separated  peptides.  However, these  techniques  are  relatively  laborious,  insensitive,  and  do  not work  with N -terminally modified peptides. More  recently, mass spectrometry has been combined with protease digestion to enable peptide  mass  mapping.  Definitively,  peptide  mass  mapping  (also known as protein/peptide mass  fingerprint or PMF)  combines enzymatic  digestion,  mass  spectrometry,  and  computer-facilitated data analysis for protein identification. Sequence specific proteases or certain chemical cleaving agents ( Table 5.1 ) are used to obtain a set of peptides from the target protein that are then mass analyzed. The  enzyme  trypsin  is  a  commonly  used  protease  that  cleaves peptides  on  the C -terminal  side  of  the  relatively  abundant  amino acids arginine (Arg) and lysine (Lys).  Thus, trypsin cleavage results in  many  reasonably  sized  fragments  from  500  to  3000  Daltons, offering  a  significant  probability  for  unambiguously  identifying  the target protein. The observed masses of the proteolytic fragments are compared  with  theoretical  digests  of  all  the  proteins  listed  in  a sequence  database  ( Figure  5.17 ).  The  matches  or  'hits'  are  then statistically evaluated and ranked according to the highest probability .

Clearly,  the  success  of  this  strategy  is  predicated  on  the existence  of the correct protein sequence  within  the  database searched. However, the quality and content of such databases are continually  improving  because  of  genomic  sequencing  of  entire organisms, and the likelihood for obtaining matches is now reasonably high. While exact matches are readily identified, proteins that exhibit significant homology  to  the  sample  are  also  often identified  with  lower  statistical  significance.  This  ability  to  identify proteins  that share  homology  with  poorly  characterized  sample species makes peptide mass mapping a valuable tool in the study of protein structure and function.

Table  5.1.  Protease  specificity.  Proteolysis  experiments  can  use  any  of  a  number  of enzymes to perform digestion. The cleavage specificity of some of the different enzymes is  denoted  by  a  slash  (/)  before  or  after  the  amino  acid  responsible  for  specificity. Combinations  of  proteases  can  be  used  to  reduce  specificity  and  to  mimic  other proteases. For example Lys-C and clostripain together are specific for the same sites as trypsin.

Upon submitting a query to a search program, a theoretical digest of all  the  proteins  in  the  database  is  performed  according to the  conditions  entered  by  the  researcher.  Variables  that  can  be controlled include taxonomic  category,  digestion conditions, the allowable number of missed cleavages, protein isoelectric point (pI), mass ranges, possible post translational modifications (PTMs), and peptide  mass  measurement  tolerance.  A  list  of  theoretical  peptide masses is created for each protein in the database according to the defined  constraints,  and  these  values  are  then  compared  to  the measured masses ( Figure 5.17 ). Each measured peptide generates a  set  of  candidate  proteins  that  would  produce  a  peptide  with  the same  mass  under  the digestion  conditions

specified.  The  proteins  in  these  sets  are  then  ranked  and  scored based on how closely they match the entire set of experimental data.

Figure 5.17. Protein identification through the comparison of tryptic peptides of an unknown protein to the theoretical digest of known proteins.  The identification can be made to be more accurate when constraints are added such as the taxanomic category  of the protein, as well as when high accuracy and MS/MS data are used.

This  method  of  identification  relies  on  the  ability  of  mass spectrometry to measure the masses of the peptides with reasonable accuracy,  with  typical  values  ranging  from  roughly  5  to  50  ppm  (5 ppm =

Â±0.005  Daltons  for  a  1,000  Dalton  peptide).  The  experimentally measured  masses  are then compared  to all the theoretically predicted peptide digests from a database  containing possibly hundreds  of  thousands  of  proteins  to  identify  the  best  possible matches.  Various  databases  ( Table  5.2 )  are  available  on  the  Web and can be used in conjunction with such computer search programs as  Profound  (developed  at  Rockefeller  University),  Spectrum  Mill (originated  at  University  of  California,  San  Francisco)  and  Mascot (Matrix Science, Limited). One obvious limitation of this methodology is that two peptides having different amino acid sequences can still have the same exact mass. In practice, matching 5-8 different tryptic peptides (within 50-100  ppm  accuracy)  is  usually sufficient to unambiguously identify a protein with an average molecular weight of 50  kDa,  while  a  greater  number  of  matches  may  be  required  to identify  a  protein  of  higher  molecular  weight.  It  is  important  to  note that  the term  protein identification  as used here

does not imply that the protein is completely characterized in terms of  its  entire  sequence,  as  well  as  all  its  PTMs.  Rather,  this  term typically refers to matching the peptides to some percentage of the amino acid sequence contained in the database. The entries in the database are both from direct protein sequence data (swissprot) and translated from genes (Genbank part of NCBI).

Table 5.2. Two of the Protein Databases Available on the Internet.

NCBInr

A largely non-redundant database compiled by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) by combining most of the public domain databases (Expressed Sequence Tags (EST's) not included).

Swiss Prot A curated protein sequence database which strives to provide a high variants, etc. This database offers a minimal level of redundancy and

level of annotations, such as the description of the function of a protein, its domain's structure, post-translational modifications, high level of integration with other databases.

In  theory,  accurate  mass  measurements  of  the  undigested protein  could  also  be  used  for  protein  identification.  In  practice, however,  the  identification  of  a  protein  based  solely  on  its  intact masses  is  very  challenging  due  to  the  stringent  sample  purity required, the need for extremely accurate mass measurements, and most importantly, the unpredictable variability introduced by numerous possible post- translational modifications (PTMs).

## Identification Using Tandem Mass Spectrometry

A more specific database searching method involves the use of  partial  sequence  information  derived  from  MS/MS  data  ( Figure 5.18 ).  As  discussed  later,  tandem  mass  spectrometry  experiments yield fragmentation patterns for individual peptides. Manual interpretation of a tandem MS experiment can often be quite difficult due to the number of different fragmentations that can occur, not all of which yield structurally useful information. However, analogous to peptide mapping experiments, the experimentally obtained fragmentation  patterns  can  be  compared  to  theoretically  generated MS/MS  fragmentation  patterns  for  the  various  proteolytic  peptides arising from  each  protein  contained  in  the  searched  database. Statistical evaluation of the results and scoring

algorithms using search engines such as Sequest (ThermoFinnigan Corp) and MASCOT (Matrix Science, Limited) facilitate the identification of the best match ( Figure 5.18 ).  The partial sequence information  contained  in  tandem  MS  experiments  is  much  more specific than simply using the mass of a peptide, since two peptides with identical amino acid contents but different sequences will exhibit different fragmentation patterns.

## Protein Characterization by Mass Spectrometry

Figure 5.18. Protein identification through the comparison of tryptic peptides of an unknown  protein  to  the  theoretical  digest  and  theoretical  MS/MS  data  of  known proteins, is even more reliable than just comparing the mass of the fragments.

While  the  molecular  weight  information  obtained  from  ESI, and MALDI are useful in the preliminary stages of characterization, it can also be very important to gain more detailed structural information through fragmentation. Tandem mass spectrometry, the ability to induce fragmentation and perform successive mass spectrometry experiments on these ions, is generally used to obtain this structural information (abbreviated MS n -  where n refers to the number of generations of fragment ions being analyzed).

One  of  the  primary  processes  by  which  fragmentation  is initiated  is  known  as  collision-induced  dissociation  (CID).  CID  is accomplished  by  selecting  an  ion  and  then  subjecting  that  ion  to collisions  with  neutral  atoms.  The  selected  ion  will  collide  with  a collision gas such as argon,

resulting in fragment ions which are then mass analyzed. CID can be accomplished  with  a  variety  of  instruments,  most  commonly  using triple  quadrupoles,  quadrupole  ion  traps,  Fourier  transform  mass spectrometry  (FTMS),  and  quadrupole  time-of-flight  (QTOF)  mass analyzers.  The  quadrupole  ion  trap  combined  with  electrospray ionization is currently the most common means of generating peptide fragmentation  data,  as  they  are  capable  of  high  sensitivity,  and produce consistently high degrees of fragmentation information.

In  order  to  obtain  peptide  sequence  information  by  mass spectrometry,  fragments  of  an  ion  must  be  produced  that  reflect structural features of the original compound.  Fortunately,  most peptides are linear molecules, which allow for relatively straightforward interpretation of the fragmentation data. The process is initiated by converting some of the kinetic energy from the peptide ion  into  vibrational  energy.  This  is  achieved  by  introducing  the selected ion, usually an (M + H) +  or (M + nH) n+  ion, into a collision cell  where  it  collides  with  neutral  Ar,  Xe,  or  He  atoms,  resulting  in fragmentation. The fragments are then monitored via mass analysis. Tandem mass spectrometry allows for a heterogeneous solution of peptides to be analyzed and then by filtering the ion of interest into the  collision  cell,  structural  information  can  be  derived  on  each peptide from a complex mixture. The fragment ions produced in this process  can  be  separated  into  two  classes.  One  class  retains  the charge on the N-terminus ( Figure 5.19 ) and fragmentation occurs at three  different  positions,  designated  as  types  an,  bn,  and  cn.  The second class of fragment ions retains the charge on the C-terminus and  fragmentation  occurs  at  three  different  positions,  types  xn,  yn, and zn. The important thing to remember is that most fragment ions generated  from  ion  traps,  triple  quadrupoles,  QTOF's  and  FTMS instruments  are  obtained  from  cleavage  between  a  carbonyl  and  a nitrogen (the amide bond). It is important to reiterate that when the charge is retained on the N-terminus this cleavage is a b-type, and when  the  charge  is  retained  on  the  C-terminus  of  the  peptide  the cleavage is y-type.

Certain limitations for obtaining complete sequence information  exist  using  tandem  mass  spectrometry.  In  determining the amino acid sequence of a peptide, it is not possible for leucine and  isoleucine  to  be  distinguished  because  they  have  the  same mass. The same difficulty will arise with lysine and glutamine (they differ  by  0.036  Daltons)  since  they  have  the  same  nominal  mass, although  high  resolution  tandem  analyzers  (QTOF  and  FTMS)  can distinguish  between  these  amino  acids.  Another  important  point  is that  because  a  complete  ion  series  (y-  or  b-  type)  is  not  usually observed,  the  combination  of  the  two  series  can  provide  useful information for protein identification.

## The Requirement for Sample Separation

Separation of proteins, or the peptides generated from a proteolytic digest, is especially important when trying to identify more than  a  couple  of  proteins  simultaneously.  Direct  analysis  by  mass spectrometry in a typical biological sample is problematic due to the significant  signal  suppression  caused  by  complex  mixtures  ( Table 5.3 ). Tryptic digestion of a typical protein can result in the production of roughly fifty peptides, while miscleavages and various PTMs can give  rise  to  many  other  unique  species.  Thus,  biologically-derived samples  can  contain  thousands  to  literally  millions  of  individual peptides in the case of whole cell extracts. By comparison, even the tryptic  digestion  of  approximately  3-5  proteins  results  in  a  peptide mixture  complex  enough  to  cause

## 5. Proteomics

considerable  signal  suppression.  Thus,  samples  of  proteins  (or peptides in a proteolytic digest) must be separated by gel electrophoresis or liquid chromatography prior to mass analysis.

## Gel Electrophoresis

Gel  electrophoresis  is  one  of  the  most  widely  used  techniques for separating intact proteins. In sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide  gel  electrophoresis  (SDS-PAGE),  sometimes  called one dimensional gel electrophoresis, the proteins are treated with the denaturing detergent SDS and loaded onto a gel. As a result, each protein  becomes coated with  a number of  negatively charged SDS molecules  directly  proportional  to  its  total  number  of  amino  acids. Upon  application  of  an  electric  potential  across  the  gel,  all  the proteins  migrate  through  the  gel  towards  the  anode  at  a  rate inversely proportional to their size. The  separation is typically performed with multiple proteins of known masses run alongside

the  proteins  of  interest  in  order  to  provide  a  size  reference.  Upon completion of the separation, the proteins are visualized using any of a  number  of  different  staining  agents  (Coomassie,  Sypro  Ruby,  or Silver), and the individual bands are physically excised from the gel. These excised spots are subjected to destaining, reductive alkylation, in-gel digestion, peptide  extraction, and  finally mass analysis for protein identification ( Figure 5.20 ).

Figure  5.20.  After performing  SDS  PAGE  separation  on  a  1D  (or  2D)  gel,  the stained portion  of  the  gel  representing  the  sample  is  cut  out  and  then  prepared  for mass  analysis  by  destaining,  performing  alkylation/reduction,  in-gel  digestion,  and spotting  on  a  MALDI  plate.  This  can  be  done  manually  or  robotically.  Protein  profiling can be performed by comparing  the  2D  gel  from two  different  cell  lines.  The  protein spot  of  interest  is  excised  from  the  gel  and  an  in-gel  proteolysis  of  the  protein  is performed.

## 2-D Gels

The  combination  of  SDS-PAGE  electrophoresis  with  an isoelectric focusing step enables the separation of proteins of similar mass. In two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2D-GE), proteins are first separated according to their isoelectric points (pI) by electrophoresis. In the electrophoresis step, each protein migrates to a  position  in  the  pH  gradient  corresponding  to  its  isoelectric  point. Once  the  isoelectric  focusing  step  is  complete,  gel  electrophoresis similar  to  SDS-PAGE  is  performed  orthogonally  to  separate  the proteins  by  size.  Like  1D  gels,  2D  gel  spots  can  be  cut  out, enzymatically digested, and mass analyzed for protein identification. Using  this  technique,  thousands  of  proteins  can  simultaneously  be separated and removed for identification.

In addition, 2D gels can help facilitate the analysis of certain PTMs.  For  example,  differently  phosphorylated  forms  of  the  same base

protein may appear as a series of bands of roughly identical mass but different isoelectric points.

The  primary  application  of  2D-GE  is  to  assess  large  scale changes in protein expression levels between two different samples (i.e. healthy versus  diseased  samples).  These  protein  profiling experiments ( Figure  5.20 )  rely  on  the  fact  that  the  chemical  stains (such as coomassie) used to visualize the separated protein bands produce responses roughly proportional to the total level of protein in the band. The experiments are typically performed by running 2D-GE on  each  of  the  samples  and  comparing  the  resulting  patterns. Proteins bands that appear in only one gel or that differ significantly in  their  intensity  are  excised  and  identified.  Alternatively,  the  two samples can be treated with different agents (i.e. different dyes with significantly  different  fluorescent  emission  spectra),  combined,  and run on the same gel.

Although  still problematic,  the  reproducibility of 2D-GE  has improved with the availability of high-quality pre-cast gels, immobilized pH gradients strips (IPG), sophisticated pattern recognition software, and laboratory automation. However, considerable  limitations  remain,  including  operational  difficulty  in handling  certain  classes  of  proteins,  the  co-migration  of  multiple proteins  to  the  same  position,  and  potential  unwanted  chemical modifications.  An  even  greater  potential  shortcoming  of  the  classic 2D-GE technique is its inability to accommodate the extreme range of protein expression levels inherent in complex living organisms due to  sample loading restrictions imposed by the gel-based separation technology  employed.  It  is  also  worth  mentioning  that  one  doesn't always know the concentrations of the samples which can result in overloading the  gel  and  streaking.  Thus,  2D-  GE  separations  often result  in  only  the  more  abundant  proteins  being  visualized  and characterized.  This  limitation  is  of  particular  concern  in  that  most interesting classes of regulatory proteins are often expressed at low concentrations.

2D DIGE (Two-Dimensional Difference Gel Electrophoresis) is  a  technique  used  in  proteomics  for  comparing  and  analyzing protein  expression  levels  between  different  samples.  Proteomics  is the study of the entire set of proteins produced by a cell, tissue, or organism, and 2D DIGE is a specialized method within this field.

Here's how 2D DIGE works:

- 1. Protein  Extraction  and  Labeling :  Proteins  from  different  samples (e.g.,  healthy  and  diseased  tissues)  are  extracted  and  labeled  with different  fluorescent dyes.  These  dyes allow you to  distinguish and quantify proteins from each sample separately.
- 2. Isoelectric  Focusing  (IEF) : In  the  first  dimension,  proteins  are separated based on their isoelectric points (pI), which is a measure of  their  overall  charge.  This  is  done  through  a  technique  called isoelectric  focusing.  A  pH  gradient  is  established  in  a  gel,  and proteins  migrate  to  positions  within  the  gradient  that  correspond  to their pI values.
- 3. SDS-PAGE (Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate-Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis) :  After  the  first-dimension  separation,  the  proteins are then separated in the second dimension using SDS- PAGE. This separation  is  based  on  molecular  weight,  with  proteins  migrating through a gel matrix under the influence of an electric field.
- 4. Image Analysis : The  separated proteins are visualized using fluorescent scanners. The images obtained from the gel reveal spots that represent individual proteins. The intensity of each spot corresponds to the amount of protein present in the original sample.
- 5. Comparative Analysis :  The images from different samples can be compared,  and  software  is  used  to  identify  differences  in  protein expression levels between the samples. Spots that show significant changes in intensity between samples are potential targets for further analysis.
- 2D DIGE has several advantages over traditional 2D gel electrophoresis:
- Â· Quantitative Comparison : Since samples are labeled with different fluorescent dyes, 2D DIGE enables direct quantitative comparison of protein expression levels between samples.
- Â· Reduced Variation :  The  internal  standards (labeled with the same dye)  help  reduce  gel-to-gel  variation,  making  it  easier  to  compare multiple gels.
- Â· Increased  Sensitivity :  The  fluorescent  dyes  used  in  2D  DIGE  are often more  sensitive than traditional protein staining methods, allowing for the detection of low-abundance proteins.
- Â· Higher Throughput : 2D DIGE is more amenable to high- throughput studies, as multiple samples can be labeled with different dyes and run on a single gel.

## 5. Proteomics

Overall,  2D  DIGE  is  a  powerful  tool  in  proteomics  that enables  researchers  to  compare  protein  expression  profiles  in  a quantitative  manner,  leading  to  insights  into  changes  in  protein expression associated with various biological conditions or experimental treatments.

## Protein ID

## MALDI-MS

The  ability to profile changes  in the expression levels of thousands  of  proteins  would  be  relatively  meaningless  without  the ability  to  rapidly  identify  species of  interest. To this end, automated liquid  handling  robots  have  been  developed  that  perform  all  the sample preparation steps for peptide mapping experiments, including gel destaining, reduction/alkylation, in gel digestion, peptide extraction, and MALDI target plating. The benefits of such automation include less potential for

contamination  during  sample  preparation,  increased  reproducibility, rapid  protocol  development,  and  the  ability  to  prepare  hundreds  of proteins in one day. Whereas manual preparation would require a full week  to  perform  two-hundred  analyses,  a  robotics  station  can complete the task in less than one day.

Mass spectral data acquisition systems have similarly been automated  to  acquire  spectra,  process  the  raw  data,  and  perform database searches for numerous samples. Commercial MALDI-TOF systems are currently available that can perform over 1,000 peptide mass mapping experiments in just twelve hours. These systems are able  to  perform  automated  calibrations,  vary  laser  energies,  and adjust  laser  firing  location  to  maximize  signal,  with  the  entire  data acquisition process requiring approximately 2 minutes or less. Similarly, automated data processing systems can recognize suitable signals, identify monoisotopic peaks, and submit summary peak lists directly to a search engine.

In  the  past,  protein  analyses  were  costly,  time  consuming  and relatively  insensitive.  Today's  high  throughput  proteomics  systems enable researchers to investigate multiple unknown samples at once such  as  those  coming  from  gels.  Additionally,  the  flexibility  of automated acquisition and data analysis software allows researchers to  rapidly  re-  acquire  and/or  re-analyze  entire  batches  of  samples with minimal user effort.

## LC-MS/MS

An  alternative  approach  to  gel  electrophoresis  techniques involves  the  use  of  analytical  separation  methods  such  as  liquid chromatography.  Although  the  rest  of  this  chapter  focuses specifically  on liquid chromatographic techniques, it  is important to note  that  the  same  advantages  also  apply  to  other  separation methods such as capillary  electrophoresis. Although fast and often effective  for  the  identification  of  individual  proteins,  direct  MALDI analyses usually fail when dealing with more complex mixtures due to significant signal suppression. By contrast, LC-based methodologies fractionate the peptide mixtures  before MS analysis, thus  decreasing  signal  suppression  and  improving  the  analysis  of any  given  peptide.  More  importantly,  additional  information  is obtained  on  individual  peptides  by  performing  tandem  MS experiments. 145

Whereas gel electrophoresis techniques separate intact proteins, liquid chromatography can be performed on the proteolytic peptides of  these  proteins.  One  of  the  most  popular  means  of  performing peptide LC-MS/MS involves the direct coupling of the LC to an ion trap mass spectrometer through an electrospray ionization interface. Other  mass  analyzers  suitable  for  these  experiments  include  triple quadrupoles and QTOF's. However, ion traps and orbitraps remain the  popular  because of their  rapid  scanning  capability  that  enables tandem  mass  measurements  to  be  performed  in  real  time.  For example,  the  ion  trap  first  performs  MS  measurements  on  all  the intact  peptide  ions.  Then,  in  a  second  scan,  it  performs  an  MS/MS experiment on a particular peptide. This series of alternating scans can rapidly be repeated, with different ions selected for each tandem MS  experiment.  In  this  manner,  single  peptides  from  a  complex mixture can individually be addressed, fragmented, and analyzed.

The additional sequence information provided by tandem MS in the  LC/MS  experiments  can  be  extremely  powerful,  sometimes enabling  a  definitive  protein  identification  to  be  made  based  on  a single  peptide.  Obviously,  tandem  MS  spectra  of  multiple  peptides that  arise  from  the  digestion  of  a  given  protein  provide  greater opportunity for obtaining a definitive identification. Generally, fragmentation information can be obtained for peptides with molecular masses up to 2500 Daltons. Larger peptides can reveal at least  partial  sequence  information  that  often  suffices  to  solve  a particular problem.

Although  complete  ion  series  (y-type  or  b-type)  are  usually  not observed,  the  combination  of  the  two  series  often  provides  useful information  and  sometimes  the  entire  sequence.  In  addition,  some amino acids as well as certain PTMs bias the fragmentation towards certain  cleavages  (loss  of  phosphate),  dramatically  decreasing  the amount of sequence information obtained. Although chemical labeling techniques can partly compensate for these phenomena, it is important to note that not every peptide yields useful tandem MS spectra, thus further emphasizing  the  usefulness  of  attempting tandem MS on multiple peptides arising from a given protein.

## 2D LC-MS/MS

LC-MS/MS  methodologies  for  protein  identification  have  been extended  to  mixtures  of  even  greater  complexity  by  performing multi-

dimensional chromatographic separations before MS analysis ( Figure  5.21 ). As  its  name  suggests,  extremely  complex  tryptic digests are first separated into a number of fractions using one mode of chromatography,  and  each  of  these  fractions  is  then  further separated using a different chromatographic method. In theory, any combination  of  operationally  compatible  chromatographic  methods possessing  sufficiently orthogonal  modes  of  separation  can  be utilized,  and  several  different  combinations  have  been  described  in the literature. However, the overwhelming number of studies to date have combined strong cation exchange (SCX) and reversed-phase (RP)  chromatographies.  More  recently,  further  improvements  have been  realized  by  having  both  chromatographic  beds  in  a  single capillary  column  and  directly  coupling  this  column  to  an  ion  trap mass spectrometer. A step gradient of salt concentrations is used to elute  different  peptide  fractions  from  the  SCX  resin  onto  the  RP material, after which  RP  chromatography  is  performed  without affecting  the  other  peptides  still  bound  to  the  SCX  resin. The resulting nano-RP LC column effluent is directly electrosprayed into the  mass  spectrometer,  making  this  method  not  only  amenable  to automation but also very sensitive. Using this 'MudPIT' methodology (Multi-Dimensional  Protein  Identification  Technology),  thousands  of unique  proteins  have  been  identified  from  a  whole  cell  lysate  in  a single  2D  LC  MS/MS  experiment.  Additionally,  recent  studies  have also  indicated  that  this  technique  possesses  a  greater  dynamic range than that obtained using 2D gel electrophoresis, enabling the detection  of  lower  abundance  proteins.  However,  one  limitation slowing this methodology's wide scale implementation is the computing power required to effectively compare tens of thousands of of tandem  MS  spectra  experimentally  generated.  Fortunately improvements in the data  analysis  algorithms  are  gradually  solving this problem.

## 2-Dimensional ESI LC MSIMS

The proteolytic peptides separated by liquid chromatography and 2-D liquid chromatography are ionized using electrospray ionization and then subjected to tandem mass  spectrometry  (MS/MS)  experiments.  The  data  from  the  1-D  experiments  can analyze  up  to  200  proteins  simultaneously,  while  the  2-D  experiments  are  capable  of handling thousands of proteins.

## Protein Mass Mapping and Isotope Labeling

Protein  mass  mapping  studies  can  also  be  performed  using multi-  dimensional  LC-MS/MS  in  conjunction  with  stable  isotope labeling  methodologies.  Specifically,  two  samples  to  be  compared are individually labeled with different forms of a stable isotopic pair, their tryptic digests combined before the final LC-MS analysis. This ideally  results  in  every  peptide  existing  as  a  pair  of  isotopically labeled  species  that  are  identical  in  all  respects  except  for  their masses. Thus, each isotopically labeled peptide effectively serves as its partner's internal standard, and the ratio of the relative heights of two isotopically labeled species provides quantitative data as to any differential change that occurred in the expression of the protein from which the peptide arose.

One approach towards differential labeling involves growing cells  in  isotopically  enriched  media.  For  example,  one  set  of  cells would be cultured in media that contained  14 N as the only source of nitrogen atoms,  while  the  comparative  case  would  be  grown  in media  that  only  contained 15 N.  Although  effective  in  incorporating different  stable  isotopes  into  the  two  samples,  the  determination  of which two peptides comprise an isotopically labeled pair is complicated  by  the  fact  that  each  pair  exhibits  a  distinct  mass difference depending on the number of isotopic atoms incorporated.

Alternatively, isotope-coded affinity tags (ICAT) ( Figure 5.22 ) provides a more generally applicable approach based on the in vitro chemical labeling of protein samples. Specifically, ICAT utilizes the high specificity of the reaction between  thiol groups and iodoacetyls  (such  as  iodoacetamide)  to  chemically  label  cysteine residues  in  proteins  with  isotopically  light  or  heavy  versions  of  a molecule  that  differ  only  by  the  existence  of  eight  hydrogen  or deuterium atoms, respectively. The labeled protein samples are then combined and simultaneously digested, resulting  in  every cysteinecontaining peptide existing as an isotopically labeled pair differing in mass by eight Daltons per cysteine residue. It should be noted that the  general  strategy  of  chemical  labeling  can  be  extended  to  other functional  groups  present  in  proteins  for  which  chemical  selective reactions exist, and several such approaches have been reported.

Figure  5.22 . The  strategy  for  protein  profiling  using  ICAT  reagents  was  first proposed  by  Gygi et  al .  ( Nature  Biotechnology )  and  can  be  broken  down  into  5 parts.  The  reagents  come  in  two  forms,  heavy  (deuterium  labeled)  and  light (hydrogen  labeled).  Two  protein  mixtures  representing  two  different  cell  states treated  with  the  isotopically  light  (open  circles)  and  heavy  (filled  circles)  ICAT reagents.  An ICAT reagent is covalently attached to each cysteinyl residue in every protein.  The  protein  mixtures  are  combined,  proteolyzed  and  the  ICAT-labeled peptides  are  isolated  with  the  biotin  tag.  LC/MS  reveals  ICAT-labeled  peptides because  they  differ  by  8  Da.  The  relative  ratios  of  the  proteins  from  the  two  cell states are determined from the peptide intensity ratios. Tandem mass spectrometry data is used concurrently to obtain sequence information and identify the protein. A more recent version of ICAT containing C13 labeling allows for better co- elution of the unlabeled and labeled peptides.

Due to the low natural abundance of cysteine compared to other amino acids, the overwhelming majority of the tryptic peptides remain unlabeled, and can interfere with the accurate determination of which two peptides comprise an isotopically labeled pair. Therefore, before the  final LC-MS/MS analysis, an affinity selection is  performed  to  selectively  isolate  the  cysteine-containing  species from the remainder of the tryptic peptides. In its original embodiment, a biotin molecule was also incorporated into the chemical label and used in conjunction with a monomeric avidin column to affinity purify the  cysteine-containing  peptides.  Alternative  approaches  such  as acid cleavable biotin are making ICAT easier to use.  Although these solutions  enable  the  accurate  identification  of  isotopically  labeled peptide pairs, they obviously preclude the analysis of proteins that do not contain cysteines and  also greatly reduce  the number  of opportunities to effect LC-MS/MS identification of the proteins that do contain cysteine residues.

<!-- image -->

LC-MALDI-MS/MS strategies involve multidimensional separation by depositing the effluents of the final separation columns directly  onto  MALDI  target  plates  ( Figure  5.23 ).  De-coupling  the separation step from the mass spectrometer in this manner enables more  thorough  analyses  of  samples  to  be  performed  due  to  the removal

of artificially imposed time restrictions. The resulting plates can also be reanalyzed as required without the need to repeat the separation step,  thus  decreasing  sample  requirements  while  focusing  system resources only on the acquisition of tandem MS spectra of species of interest. An advantage of this approach is high throughput while the two main disadvantages are relatively poor MS/MS data from singly charged  species  typically  generated  from  MALDI  and  quantitative analyses  of  protein  content  with  MALDI  is  not  as  accurate  as  ESI based approaches.

## Protein Mass Mapping Overview

Both  MALDI  and  LC-MS/MS  are  playing  important  roles  in protein identification and protein profiling. MALDI  offers many advantages in terms of speed and ease of use, whereas LC-MS/MS offers  a  more  reliable  protein  ID  as  well  as  a  greater  potential  for quantitative analysis and post-translational modification identification. LC-MS/MS currently appears to be the primary tool for profiling.

## Protein Stucture

Mass  spectrometry  is  now  commonly  used  for  determining both the primary and higher order structures of proteins. The basis for these investigations lies in the ability of mass analysis techniques to detect changes in protein conformation under differing conditions. These  experiments  can  be  conducted  on  proteins  alone  such  as monitoring charge state  or in combination with  proteolytic  digestion or chemical modification. Proteases and chemical modification have long been used as probes of higher order structure, an approach that has  been  rejuvenated  with  the  emergence  of  high  sensitivity  and accurate mass analysis techniques. Here, the applications of proteases  and  chemical  modification  with  mass  spectrometry  are illustrated.  For  example,  protein  mass  maps  have  been  used  to probe the structure of a protein/protein complex in solution (cell cycle regulatory proteins, p21 and Cdk2). This approach was also used to study  the  protein/protein  complexes  that  comprise  viral  capsids, including  those  of  the  common  cold  virus  where,  in  addition  to structural information, protein mass mapping revealed mobile features  of  the  viral  proteins.  Protein  mass

mapping clearly has broad utility in protein identification and profiling, yet  its  accuracy  and  sensitivity  also  allow  for  further  exploration  of protein structure and even structural dynamics.

Protein  mass  mapping  combines  enzymatic  digestion,  mass spectrometry, and computer-facilitated data analysis to produce and examine  proteolytic  fragments.  This  is  done  for  the  purpose  of identifying proteins  and,  more  recently,  for  obtaining  information regarding protein structure. For protein identification, sequencespecific proteases are incubated with the protein of interest and mass analysis  is  performed  on  the  resulting  peptides.  The  peptides  and their  fragmentation  patterns  are  then  compared  with  the  theoretical peptides predicted for all proteins within a database and matches are statistically evaluated. Similarly, the higher order structure of a protein can be evaluated when mass mapping techniques are combined with limited proteolytic digestion. Limited proteolysis refers to the exposure of  a  protein  or  complex  to  digestion  conditions  that  last  for  a  brief period; this is performed to gain information on the parts of the protein exposed to  the surface.

The  sequence  specificity  of  the  proteolytic  enzyme  plays  a major role in the application of mass spectrometry to protein structure. A sequence-specific protease reduces the number of fragments that are produced and, concomitantly, not only improves the likelihood for statistically significant matches  between  observed  and  predicted fragment  masses,  but  also  reduces  the  opportunities  for  spurious matches.  Another  factor,  the  accessibility/flexibility  of  the  site  to  the protease, also plays an important role in the analysis of structure. In this  instance,  ideally,  only  a  subset  of  all  possible  cleavages  is observed owing to the inaccessibility and/or inflexibility of some sites due to higher order protein structure. An example illustrated in Figure 5.24 provides  asterisks  to  mark  potential  cleavage  sites  that  are exposed on the surface of a hypothetical protein. Since amino acids with  hydrophilic  side  chains  are  found  in  greater  abundance  on  the surface of proteins (at the solvent interface), proteases that cleave at hydrophilic sites are preferred in structural analysis.  Trypsin and  V8 protease, which cleave basic (K, R) and acidic sites (D, E), respectively, are good choices. Reaction conditions must be controlled  to  produce  only  limited  proteolysis  so  that  the  cleavage pattern reliably reports on native tertiary structure. The cleavage of a single  peptide  bond  can  destabilize  protein  structure,  causing  local structural  changes  or  even  global  unfolding.  Therefore,  subsequent protease cleavage reactions would not be useful.

## theoretical proteolysis of a single protein

Figure 5.24. Illustration of the use of limited proteolytic cleavage as a probe of protein structure.  The  asterisks  mark  surface  accessible  loops  that  would  be  susceptible  to proteolytic cleavage. Mass  analysis  of  the limited proteolytic fragments  yields a cleavage 'map' that provides information on structure. Complete digestion provides no structural information but is useful for protein identification.

Protein  mass  mapping  can  also  be  used  to  probe  the quaternary structure of multicomponent assemblies such as proteinprotein complexes, protein-DNA complexes and even intact viruses. The first application of limited proteolysis and MALDI mass spectrometry to the study of a multicomponent biomolecular assembly was performed by Chait and co-workers in 1995. In their studies, this combined approach was used to analyze the structure of  the  protein  transcription  factor,  Max,  free  in  solution  as  well  as bound to an oligonucleotide containing its specific DNA binding site. The common feature when analyzing either protein-protein complexes or protein-DNA complexes is that the protease provides a contrast  between  the  associated  and  unassociated  states  of  the system. The formation of an interface between a protein and another macromolecule will protect otherwise accessible sites from protease cleavage and therefore provide information about residues that form the interface.

## Recognizing Conformational Changes with Mass Mapping

Protein  mass  mapping  can  be  used  to  recognize  simple conformational  differences  between  different  protein  states.  For example,  X-ray  crystallography  data  has  shown  that  the  protein calmodulin (CaM) undergoes conformational changes in the presence  of  calcium.  The  tertiary  structure  of  calmodulin  consists of  an  overall

dumbbell  shape  (148  amino  acids)  with  two  globular  domains separated  by  a  single,  long  central  alpha-helix  connector  (amino acids  65-92).  It  has  been  proposed  that  calcium-binding  activates calmodulin by exposing hydrophobic residues near the two ends of the  central  helix.  Mass  maps  resulting  from  digests  by  trypsin, chymotrypsin,  and  pepsin  all  demonstrated  that  the  protein  had undergone  a  tertiary  structural  change  in  the  presence  of  calcium.

Figure 5.25 shows the trypsin digests of calmodulin in the presence and  absence  of  calcium.  Comparison  of  the  two  mass  spectra reveals differences corresponding to cleavages in the central helical region  of  the  protein.  Based  on  the  results  of  this  relatively  simple experiment, it can be appreciated that structural changes caused by Ca 2+ binding  within  the  dumbbell  domains  are  propagated  to  the central helix, as manifested by altered protease reactivity within this latter structural feature.

Differences are observed corresponding to cleavages within the central helical region of calmodulin (black dots) which are not observed in the presence of calcium (yellow dots) indicating a tertiary conformational change.  Cleavage sites that are present in the Ca 2+ /Calmodulin complex (black dots) and those that disappear upon addition  of  Ca 2+ (yellow  dots)  are  shown  in  both  the  spectra  and  the  ribbon  drawing.

Electrospray  ionization  mass  spectrometry  has  also  been used to monitor protein folding and protein complexes. Early in the use  of  electrospray  it  was  recognized  that  some  proteins  exhibit  a distinct  difference  in  their  charge  state  distribution  which  was  a reflection of their solution conformation(s). For example, two charge state distributions are  shown  in Figure 5.26, which  depicts  a protein's  less-charged  native  form  and  the  more  highly  charged denatured conformation. The difference between the spectra is due to  the  additional  protonation  sites  available  in  the  denatured  form. This phenomenon is demonstrated for the protein fibronectin where the  charge  distribution  is  maximized  at  the  lower  charge  states  at +6,  and  the  denatured  protein  has  a  distribution  maximized  at  a higher charge state of +10. There is growing recognition of the view that  proteins  function  through  a  diverse  range  of  structural  states, from  highly  ordered  globular  structures  to  highly  flexible,  extended conformations. ESI-MS is a simple but highly sensitive and informative method to characterize the functional shape(s) of proteins  ( i.e. globular  or  extended)  prior  to  more  material-intensive and time- consuming spectroscopic or crystallographic studies.

Denaturing  a  protein  can  often  enhance ionization  by  dramatically  increasing  the  number  of  sites  available  for  protonation. The  data  shown  represent  both  the  native  and  denatured  conformers  of  the fibronectin module. Adapted from Muir et al. (1995).

The  use  of  hydrogen/deuterium  (H/D)  exchange  to  study conformational  changes  ( Figure  5.27 )  in  proteins  or  protein/protein interactions  has  been  primarily  performed  using  ESI-MS,  although some  studies  have  employed  MALDI-MS.  The  concept  of  this approach  is

relatively  simple  in  that  amide  protons  within  the  portion  of  the proteins in close inter- or intra-molecular contact may form hydrogen bonds and will have different exchange rates relative to other more accessible regions of the complex. By  monitoring this amidehydrogen exchange, information can be gained on the noncovalent structure of a  protein  by itself  or  in  a  protein  complex.  It  should  be noted  that  while  it is not possible  through  ESI-MS  to  monitor exchange  in a residue-specific manner,  populations of protein molecules with distinct masses can be distinguished. The combined application  of  ESI-MS  with  NMR  spectroscopy  to  monitor  protein folding  reactions  using  H/D  exchange  is  particularly  powerful.  For example, Dobson, Robinson, and co-workers characterized in detail transient  protein  folding  intermediates  for  the  protein  egg  white lysozyme using this dual approach. This was the first demonstration of discreet yet transient intermediates during a protein folding reaction.  Importantly,  these  key  findings  were  made  possible  only by complementing the more traditional NMR-H/D exchange approach with data from ESI-MS .

Kriwacki et al. demonstrated the utility of limited proteolysis on the cell-cycle regulatory proteins, Cdk2 and p21-B ( Figure 5.28 ). Given the known protein sequence and the sequence specificity of trypsin, the mass measurement readily identifies the exact proteolytic site within each individual protein's sequence. The results revealed a segment of  24  amino  acids  in  p21-B  that  is  protected  from  trypsin cleavage, thus identifying the segment as the Cdk2 binding site on p21-B.  The  concepts  illustrated  in  this  simple  example  can  be extended  to  much  more

complex  systems,  allowing  insights  into  tertiary  and  quaternary structure to be obtained using picomole quantities of protein.

## Protein Structure Overview

The  utility  of  combining  proteolysis  as  well  as  chemical modification methods  with MS  analysis is becoming  useful in structural  studies  of  proteins.  It  is  important  to  note  that  the  key concepts  of the methods  are  straightforward, and  the probing reactions  are  simple  to  perform.  In  the  early  stages  of  structural studies,  the  MS-based  probing  methods  are  particularly  well-suited to  provide  rapid  access  to  low-  resolution  maps  that  can  then  be used to  guide subsequent high- resolution crystallographic or NMR studies. This stage may also be an end-point in some investigations where the simple identification of interacting residues is the desired information. Probing studies have also been shown to provide insight into structural dynamics.

## Metabolomic Fundamentals

## Perspective

The  fundamental  concepts  of  metabolomics  and  how  mass spectrometry  data  acquisition  is  typically  performed  will  be  covered in  this  chapter.  Historically  speaking,  I  was  personally  intrigued  to learn  that  the  first  GC/MS  metabolite  profiling  was  performed  as early  as  1966  by  Dalgliesh  et  al.,  a  good  27  years  prior  to  my  own efforts  at  Scripps  in  1993  with  LC/MS-based  metabolite  profiling  on cerebral  spinal  fluid  (before  the  term  'metabolomics'  was  created). Times have changed, as metabolomics is now much more technologically and informatically sophisticated.

## What is metabolomics and the metabolome?

The metabolome refers to the collection of small molecules produced  by  cells,  which  can  provide  valuable  insight  into  the relationship between mechanistic biochemistry and cellular phenotype.  Thanks  to  advances  in  mass  spectrometry,  it  is  now possible to measure thousands  of metabolites  simultaneously  from only  minimal amounts  of sample, enabling comprehensive analysis without  bias.  Additionally,  recent  innovations  in  instrumentation, bioinformatic  tools,  and  software  have  further  facilitated  these analyses  and  even  provided  for  spatially  localized  detection  of metabolites  within  biological  specimens  using  mass  spectrometry imaging. By   applying    these technologies, researchers have uncovered system-wide alterations of unexpected metabolic pathways  in  response  to  phenotypic  perturbations,  revealing  a  far more  complex  picture  of  cellular  metabolism  than  was  previously understood. Despite this progress, many of the molecules detected remain  uncharacterized  in  databases  and  metabolite  repositories, underscoring the incomplete nature of our current understanding of

cellular  metabolism.  Nevertheless,  the  field  of  metabolomics  has made  tremendous  strides  in  the  last  three  decades  since  the  first LC/MS  profiling  experiments  were  performed,  and  new  tools  are offering  exciting  mechanistic  insights  by  enabling  researchers  to correlate biochemical changes with phenotype ( Figure 6.1 ).

Figure  6.1.  The  central  dogma  of  biology  describes  the  flow  of  genetic  information from  DNA  to  RNA  to  protein.  The  'omic  cascade  extends  this  flow  to  include  the downstream products of cellular metabolism, namely metabolites and therefore closest to  the  phenotype.  Alterations  in  a  single  gene  or  protein  can  lead  to  a  cascade  of metabolite alterations, illustrated by red and blue dots in the schematic. By performing meta-analysis  (shown  here  with  3  different  genetic  alterations),  metabolic  alterations shared  between  multiple  animal  models  or  multiple  genetic  modifications  may  be identified,  as  shown  by  the  superimposed  Venn  diagram.  Up-  and  down-regulated metabolites are shown in red, and unaltered metabolites are shown in grey.

One  topic  of  discussion  will  be  the  distinction  between targeted  and  untargeted  approaches  to  metabolomics.  While  both approaches have their merits, the value of untargeted metabolomics will  be  emphasized,  and  a  practical  guide  to  performing  such  an experiment will be provided. One of the first steps in any metabolomics experiment is to determine the number of metabolites

to be measured. In some cases, researchers may choose to take a targeted  approach  and  focus  on  a  defined  set  of  metabolites.  In contrast,  an  untargeted  or  global  approach  may  be  preferred,  in which as many metabolites as possible are measured and compared between samples without bias. The choice of approach will depend on  the  scientific  question  being  addressed,  and  the  number  and chemical composition of metabolites studied will shape the experimental  design,  including  decisions  about  sample  preparation and choice of instrumentation. Ultimately, the approach chosen will have  important implications for the depth and  breadth of the metabolomic  data  generated  and  will  influence  subsequent  data analysis and interpretation.

## Targeted Metabolomics

Targeted  metabolomics  involves  the  measurement  of  a predefined set of metabolites, often focusing on one or more related pathways of interest. This approach is commonly driven by a specific biochemical question or hypothesis, motivating the investigation of a particular  pathway.  Targeted  metabolomics  is  particularly  effective for  pharmacokinetic  studies  of  drug  metabolism  and  for  measuring the  influence  of  therapeutics  or  genetic  modifications  on  a  specific enzyme. Developments in mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) have distinct advantages for performing targeted metabolomic  studies, including their specificity and  quantitative reproducibility. Although the term "metabolomics" is relatively recent, examples of targeted studies of metabolites date back to the 1960s, resulting  in  a  wealth  of  literature  investigating  optimal  protocols  for the sample preparation and analysis of specific classes of metabolites. These  protocols have been extensively discussed elsewhere.

Undoubtedly, targeted approaches have played a significant role  in  the  development  of  metabolomics.  Advances  in  using  triple quadrupole  (QqQ)  MS  ( Figure  6.2 )  to  perform  selective  reaction monitoring experiments  have  enabled  routine  analysis  of most metabolites in central carbon metabolism, amino acids, and nucleotides at their physiological concentrations. These developments offer highly sensitive and robust methods to measure a significant number  of biologically important metabolites with relatively high  throughput.  QqQ  MS  methods  are  quantitatively

reliable,  offering  opportunities  to  achieve  absolute  quantitation  of low-concentration  metabolites  that  are  difficult  to  detect  with  less sensitive methods such as NMR. Applying QqQ MS-based methods to human plasma allows screening of targeted lists of metabolites as potential metabolic signatures for disease.

## Untargeted (or Global) Metabolomics

Untargeted metabolomic methods are designed to generate a  global  picture  of  the  metabolome,  providing  for  the  simultaneous measurement  of  numerous  metabolites  from  biological  samples without bias. Although both NMR and MS technologies can be used to perform untargeted metabolomics, liquid chromatography followed by  MS  (LC/MS)  is  the  preferred  technique  for  global  metabolite profiling.  LC/MS-based  metabolomic  methods  can  routinely  detect thousands of peaks, each of which represents a metabolite feature. These features correspond to a detected ion with a unique mass-tocharge  ratio  and  retention  time,  although  some  metabolites  may produce more than one feature.

Compared to targeted metabolomic results, untargeted metabolomic datasets are highly complex, with file sizes ranging in the  order  of  gigabytes  per  sample  for  some  of  the  latest  highresolution  MS  instruments.  Manual  inspection  of  the  thousands  of peaks  detected  is not practical and  is further complicated by experimental  drifts  in  instrumentation.  For  instance,  deviations  in retention time from  sample  to  sample  are  common  in  LC/MS experiments  due  to  factors  such  as  column  degradation,  sample carryover, small fluctuations in room temperature, mobile phase pH, among others. Although these challenges initially presented significant obstacles for interpreting untargeted profiling data, remarkable progress has been made in the last decade through the development of metabolomic software such as XCMS and MZMine, making it routine to determine which features were  dysregulated  in global metabolomic datasets. These accomplishments have already provided insights into the fact that an astonishing number  of metabolites  remain  uncharacterized  regarding  their  structure  and function, and that many of these uncharacterized metabolites change in response to health and disease. Hence, untargeted metabolomics has great potential to shed light on fundamental biological processes. In the rest of this article, we will focus on the untargeted metabolomic approach.

The  impetus  for  untargeted  metabolomics  dates  back  to 1941, when G. Beadle and E. L. Tatum proposed the one gene-one enzyme hypothesis. This hypothesis was based on their experimental results, which showed  that X-ray-induced mutant strains  of  the  fungus  Neurospora  crassa  were  unable  to  carry  out specific  biochemical  reactions.  By  systematically  adding  individual compounds to minimal N. crassa media and screening for those that rescued  the  growth  of  mutant  strains,  Beadle  and  Tatum  identified metabolites whose  biosynthesis had been affected by genetic mutation.  Their  work  was  the  first  to  directly  connect  genotype  to phenotype  at  the  molecular  level,  and  they  purported  that  a  single gene serves as the  primary  control  of  a  single  function,  such  as  a specific chemical reaction. This hypothesis laid the foundation for the study  of  the  relationships  between  genes  and  metabolic  pathways and ultimately led to the development of modern untargeted metabolomics techniques.

Modern-day metabolomic experiments aim to connect genotype  and  phenotype  by  screening  metabolites.  However,  the experimental  screening  methods  used  today  are  highly  advanced, enabling the simultaneous study of many more compounds. Moreover, contemporary metabolic profiling experiments benefit from being complemented by genomic sequencing and proteomic screening.  These  global  analyses  have  led  to  the  emergence  of systems  biology,  which  has  shown  that  a  single  non-lethal  gene mutation  can  have  dauntingly  large  effects.  Indeed,  single  gene mutations  can  affect  a  significant  number  of  metabolic  pathways, thereby  complicating  the  hypothesis  that  a  single  gene  controls  a single  function.  Furthermore,  mutations  in  some  unique  genes  can have  unexpected  phenotypic  effects.  For  instance,  the  daf-2  gene encodes an insulin-like receptor in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans. Mutations in daf-2 result in the worm living more  than  twice  as  long  as  its  wild-type  counterpart  and  cause alterations in the abundance  of  at  least  86  identified  proteins. Similarly, genes that encode for enzymes of the phosphatidyl-inositol 3-kinase family, which function in cell growth, proliferation, differentiation,  motility,  and  signal  transduction,  are  thought  to  have an oncogenic role in some cancers when mutated.

The  examples  provided  illustrate  how  a  single  gene  can have  a  far-reaching  impact  on  numerous  metabolic  pathways  and contribute  to  multiple  cellular  processes.  Even  with  knowledge  of protein  structure,  inferring  function  at  the  whole-organism  level  can be  challenging  due  to  complex  regulatory  mechanisms  that  involve epigenetic  control,  post-translational modifications,  and  feedback loops that enable context-dependent activation or deactivation. As a result, investigating the role of specific genes often requires systemslevel  analyses.  Although  these  types  of  global  studies  were  once limited to genes,  transcripts, and  proteins,  recent  technological developments have enabled untargeted profiling of metabolites and presented  new  opportunities  to  comprehensively  track  metabolic reactions directly.

Untargeted  workflow . Untargeted  metabolomic  experiments  are often  hypothesis  generating  rather  than  hypothesis  driven,  so  it  is crucial to design experiments that maximize the detection of metabolites  and  ensure  their  quantitative  reproducibility.  However, metabolite identification can be  a time-consuming  process, so it  is

important to carefully choose the sample type, preparation, chromatographic separation, and analytical instrumentation to obtain high-quality data. In this context, LC/MS-based  workflows are preferred because they offer high sensitivity and enable the detection of  a  large  number  of  metabolites  using  minimal  sample  amounts (typically less than 25 mg of tissue, approximately 1 million cells, or around 50 ÂµL of biofluids such as plasma and urine). Therefore, it is important to consider and choose the workflow that is most likely to yield high-quality data for analysis.

Sample  preparation and data acquisition . The  first step in untargeted  metabolomic  workflow  is  to  extract  metabolites  from biological samples. Several approaches, such as sample homogenization and protein precipitation, have been utilized and are described  in  detail  elsewhere.  Prior  to  MS  analysis,  the  isolated metabolites are chromatographically separated using relatively short solvent gradients, enabling high-throughput analysis of large sample numbers. Multiplexing, extraction, and separation methods maximize the number  of  metabolites  detected  due  to  the  heterogeneous physiochemical landscape of the metabolome. For instance, extracting  the  same  cells  with  both  organic  and  aqueous  solvents increase  the  detection  of  hydrophobic  and  hydrophilic  compounds, respectively. Similarly, reversed-phase  chromatography  is  better suited  for  separating  hydrophobic  metabolites,  while  hydrophilicinteraction chromatography is generally more effective for separating hydrophilic  compounds.  Although  quadrupole  time-of-flight  (QTOF) mass  spectrometers  and  Orbitrap  mass  spectrometers  are  most commonly  used  to  collect  data,  other  instruments  such  as  time-offlight and ion trap instruments can also be used. Because predicting tandem MS (MS/MS) fragmentation patterns for most metabolites is challenging, unlike in shotgun 'omic approaches, untargeted metabolomic  profiling data is typically acquired in MS1  mode, measuring only the mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of the intact metabolite.

Data analysis .  Advances in bioinformatic tools have led to a more automated process for identifying metabolite features that are differentially altered between sample groups. Various metabolomic software programs are available that provide a range of capabilities, including peak picking, non-linear retention time alignment, visualization, relative quantitation, and statistical analysis. Among the

## 6. Metabolomic Fundamentals

available software programs, XCMS is a widely used and is freely accessible online. Users can upload data and perform data processing, as well as browse results within a web-based interface. (https://xcmsonline.scripps.edu/).

Metabolite identification . It is worth noting that current metabolomic software  does  not  effectively  output  all  metabolite  identifications. Instead,  it provides  a  table  of  features  with  p-values  and  fold changes  that  indicate  their  relative  intensity  differences  between samples.  To  determine  the  identity  of  a  feature  of  interest,  the accurate  mass  of  the  compound  is  first  searched  in  metabolite databases  like  METLIN.  However,  a  database  match  represents only  a  putative  metabolite  assignment  that  must  be  confirmed  by comparing  the  retention  time  and  MS/MS  data  of  a  molecular standard to that of the feature of interest in the research sample.

## Metabolite Characterization

Second, the retention time (38.9 min, black) is compared to that of a standard (39.0 min, red). Finally, the MS/MS spectra (black) and the standard (red) match.

Currently, the additional experiments  required  to obtain MS/MS data for selected features from the profiling results, as well as  the  matching  of  MS/MS  fragmentation  patterns,  are  performed manually  by  inspection  ( Figure  6.3 ). These  analyses  are  timeintensive  and  represent  the  rate-limiting  step  of  the  untargeted metabolomic  workflow.  Moreover,  despite  the  growth  of  metabolite databases over the last decade,  a significant  number of metabolite features detected from biological samples do not return any matches.  Identifying these unknown  features  requires  de novo characterization with traditional methods. It is important to recognize that comprehensive identification of all metabolite features detected by LC/MS is currently impractical for most samples analyzed.

## Challenges

The field of metabolomics has seen remarkable advancements  in recent years, thanks to the development of innovative technologies and experimental strategies that have enabled researchers to better understand the complex and dynamic nature  of  the  metabolome.  Untargeted  metabolomics,  in  particular, has revolutionized the field by revealing that the number of endogenous  metabolites  in  biological  systems  is  much  larger  than previously thought.

Despite  these  advances,  however,  there  are  still many challenges that need to be addressed. One of the main challenges is the fact that the metabolome is not encoded in the genome, which makes  it  difficult  to  analyze  an  undefined  set  of  molecules.  To overcome  this  challenge,  metabolite  databases  have  been  rapidly expanding, which has facilitated untargeted studies.

However,  despite  the  expansion  of  metabolite  databases, there  are  still  many  metabolites  for  which  the  chemical  structure, cellular function, biochemical pathway,  and  anatomical  location remain  uncharacterized.  To  address  this  issue,  researchers  are increasingly  turning  to  innovative  technologies  and  experimental strategies that can be coupled with untargeted profiling.

For example, the development  of high-resolution mass spectrometry  (HRMS)  has  enabled  researchers  to  detect  a  wider range  of  metabolites,  including  those  with  unusual  or  unexpected masses. Additionally, the use of stable isotope labeling has allowed researchers  to  trace  the  fate  of  specific  metabolites  in  biological systems,  providing  valuable  insights  into  their  metabolic  pathways and cellular functions.

Other innovative strategies that are driving progress in the field include the use of multi-omics approaches, which integrate metabolomics data with other omics data, such as genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics, to provide a more comprehensive understanding of biological systems. Furthermore, the use of machine learning algorithms and artificial intelligence (AI) is enabling researchers to analyze and interpret large amounts of metabolomics data, facilitating the identification of novel biomarkers and metabolic pathways.

Improving  metabolite  databases .  Over  the  last  two  decades,  the information catalogued in metabolite databases has evolved beyond lists of one-dimensional data that is traditionally acquired by tandem mass spectrometry. The NIST tandem mass spectrometry database, for example,  now  stands  at  31K  molecules  with  MS/MS  data. However the METLIN database has leapfrogged all other databases and contains tandem mass spectrometry experimental data for over 900,000 molecular standards. All METLIN data has been generated from  molecular  standards  and  has  been  acquired  in  both  positive and negative ionization modes and at four different collision energy (in each ionization mode).

Meta-analysis : Altering a single enzyme can set off a chain reaction of  metabolic  perturbations  that  may  not  be  related  to  the  intended phenotype.  Therefore,  when  conducting  untargeted  metabolomic profiling  of  a  particular  disease  or  mutant,  hundreds  of  alterations may  be  observed  that  lack  mechanistic  significance.  Given  the considerable resources required to identify both known and unknown compounds, it is advantageous to use strategies that can reduce the list of potentially interesting features  before  committing  time  to identification. One such strategy is meta-analysis, whereby untargeted profiling data from multiple studies are compared ( Figure 6.1 ).  For  example,  by  comparing  different  models  of  a  disease,

features  that  are  not  similarly  altered  in  each  comparison  can  be given  lower  priority  as  they  may  be  less  likely  to  be  related  to  the shared  phenotypic  pathology.  A  freely  available  software  called metaXCMS  has  been  developed  to  automate  the  comparison  of untargeted  metabolomic  data.  As  a  proof  of  concept  ( Figure  6.4 ), metaXCMS was applied to investigate three pain models of varying pathogenic etiologies: inflammation, heat, and arthritis.

Figure 6.4, metaXCMS was utilized to investigate three different pain models, which have different sources: inflammation, heat, and arthritis. The analysis revealed hundreds of metabolite features that were dysregulated in each model. However, only three metabolites were found to be commonly dysregulated among all the groups. One of the shared metabolites was histamine, a well-known mediator of pain that functions through multiple mechanisms. This finding highlights the potential of 'similar datareduction' strategies to identify physiologically relevant unknown features in other biological systems.

While hundreds of metabolite features were found to be altered in each model, only three were similarly dysregulated among all groups. One of the shared metabolites was histamine, a wellcharacterized mediator of pain that functions through several mechanisms. By applying similar data-reduction strategies to other biological systems, it may be possible to justify aggressive analytical investigations of physiologically relevant unknown features.

Imaging approaches to localize metabolites .  Metabolite isolation through  sample  homogenization  is  a  crucial initial step in the untargeted  metabolomic  workflow  for  analyzing  biological  tissues. However, the lack of high-resolution spatial localization of metabolites  within  samples,  due  to  standard  metabolic  profiling techniques, poses a significant challenge. The averaging of different

cell  types  with  potentially  unique  metabolomes  in  heterogeneous tissues,  such  as  the  brain,  further  complicates  investigations.  As  a result, identifying a dysregulated metabolite and its specific location within  a  tissue  or  cell  type  can  be  challenging.  To  overcome  these limitations,  advanced  imaging  techniques  and  analytical  methods, such as mass spectrometry imaging, are being developed to enable more precise spatial resolution of metabolites in tissues.

Figure 6.5. Spatial localization of metabolites in tissue by mass spectrometry-based imaging. Example of a surface-based image of [cholesterol + Ag]+ from mouse brain by using nanostructure-imaging mass spectrometry (NIMS). NIMS is well-suited for metabolite imaging because it is sensitive and does not suffer from matrix interference in the low-mass range. Sections of frozen tissue are first transferred to a NIMS chip that  is  subsequently  analyzed  by  using  a  laser-induced  desorption/ionization approach. By systematically rastering the laser across the tissue, a mass spectrum is generated from each point.

<!-- image -->

MS-based imaging relies on matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) offer chemical specificity and sensitivity, but they are  limited  in  their  application  to  metabolites  due  to  background interference caused by the matrix in the low-mass region characteristic of metabolites. As an alternative, a matrix-free technique  called  nanostructure  imaging  mass  spectrometry  (NIMS) has  been  developed  for  the  analysis  of  metabolites  with high sensitivity  and  spatial  resolution  ( Figure  6.5 ).  By  using  NIMS  to analyze  3  Âµm  sections  of  brain  tissue  from  mice  with  impaired cholesterol  biosynthesis,  metabolic  precursors  of  cholesterol  were found  to  localize  to  the  cerebellum  and  brainstem.  These  types  of NIMS imaging applications coupled with histology will allow metabolite localization patterns to be correlated with tissue pathology

and drive developments in our understanding of chemical physiology.

## Overview

Over  the  years,  there has  been  a  growing  interest  in metabolic  profiling, yet only in recent times  have  technologies emerged that enable the global analysis of metabolites at a systems level comparable  to  genomics,  transcriptomics,  and  proteomics. Unlike  its  'omic  counterparts,  metabolomics  allows  for  the  direct measurement  of  biochemical  activity  by  monitoring  the  substrates and products involved in cellular metabolism. This untargeted profiling  of  chemical  transformations  at  a  global  level  provides  a phenotypic  readout  that  has  been  useful  in  clinical  diagnostics, identifying  therapeutic  targets  of  diseases,  and  investigating  the mechanisms of fundamental biological processes.

Although untargeted metabolomics is still in its early stages, recent  studies  have  shown  that  the  complexity  of  comprehensive cellular metabolism is more extensive than what classical biochemical pathways suggest. This realization is reminiscent of how the  emergence  of  experimental  results,  such  as  the  photoelectric effect, in the early twentieth century challenged Newtonian laws and eventually led to the development  of  quantum  mechanics.  As metabolomic  technologies  continue  to  advance  and  enable  the characterization  of  unknown  pathways,  untargeted  metabolomics has the potential to shape our understanding of global metabolism.

## XCMS Data Processing

## Perspective

XCMS (eXtensible  Computational  Mass  Spectrometry)  is  a  wellknown  software  platform  utilized  for  the  processing  of  liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) data, available both as an R package and a cloud-based platform called XCMS Online. It is especially known for introducing nonlinear alignment for LC-MS data processing  ( Figures  7.1  and  7.2 ),  thus  facilitating  more  accurate statistical  comparisons  across  data  sets.  This  chapter  provides an overview  of  LC-MS  data  analysis,  emphasizing  the  importance of data processing software. Subsequently, we delve into the algorithms  employed  by  XCMS  and  elucidate  the  significance of user-defined  parameters  in  LC-MS  data  processing.  Lastly,  we explore  the  additional  functionalities  provided  by  XCMS  Online, thereby showcasing its expanded capabilities.

Figure 7.1. The logo that has come to represent XCMS (right) was derived from the very first nonlinear alignment of LC/MS data (right) using an algorithm created by Colin Smith. The beauty of that original compilation of LC/MS correction plots led me to use the plot routinely, which has since become synomonous with XCMS.

## How are metabolomics data processing platforms used?

Untargeted or global metabolomics is a research approach focused on  quantifying  a  wide  range  of  metabolites  in  biological  samples. Among  various  technologies employed  for this purpose, liquid chromatography-electrospray  ionization mass  spectrometry  (LCESI-MS or simply LC-MS) stands out as one of the most commonly used methods. This popularity is owed to its straightforward sample preparation process and extensive coverage of metabolites. LC-MS generates  vast  and  intricate  datasets,  consisting  of  thousands  of metabolic features. Consequently, computational tools are crucial for effectively  processing  this  data  and  transforming  it  into  meaningful and interpretable information.

Figure 7.2. Cloud-based XCMS computing provides an interconnectedness with infrastructure, data sharing and the ability to integrate multiple resources. The multi- omics XCMS Online platform with over 50,000 registered users represents a freely available, cloud-based resource offering data processing, archiving and sharing, easy- to-use statistical tools, intuitive visualization, pathway analysis and metabolite identification.

The untargeted computational data processing workflow ( Figure 7.3 ) gained significant traction in 2006 following the publication of XCMS. This workflow typically involves a series of steps, starting with peak picking  and  nonlinear  alignment.  The  outcome  of  this  process  is  a collection  of  features,  representing  individual  peaks  or  groups  of peaks with distinct m/z values and retention times across samples. The objective is to convert the raw data into a matrix that comprises

a  list  of  observed  features,  accompanied  by  their  corresponding relative peak  areas  or  intensities for each  sample  in  a  given experiment. This compilation  of features, known as the feature  list, enables the comparison  of peak  areas (correlating to relative concentrations) among identical ion peaks across samples, facilitating  the  identification  of  statistically  significant  dysregulated peaks associated with a particular phenotype.

In the cloud plot the size of the bubble reflects fold change and the intensity of the color reflects p-value. Information for each metabolic feature is also tabulated, including direction of dysregulation, fold change, P value, m/z, retention time, adduct form and the XCMS feature ID number. Clicking the unique feature ID (or bubble on the cloud plot) opens a pop-up window displaying the MS spectrum, LC chromatogram and box-and-whisker plot for that metabolic feature.

## XCMS Data Streaming

A unique feature  of  XCMS is its implementation of data streaming, addressing  the  issue  that  data  transfer  times  can  represent  a bottleneck in data processing due to the increasingly complex data files  including  greater  number  of  samples.  To  meet  the  demand  of analyzing  hundreds  to  thousands  of  samples,  we  developed  data streaming which capitalizes on the acquisition time to stream recently  acquired  data  files  to  data  processing  servers,  mimicking just-in-time  strategies  from  the  entertainment industry. Its utility  has been  demonstrated  with  as  much  as  a  10,000-fold  time  savings, dramatically reducing data analysis time ( Figures 7.4 ).

Streaming allows users to increase the efficiency of  their  analytical workflow by reducing data transfer times. Previously, data acquisition time  was  considered  'useless'  in  terms  of  data  processing  and analysis  time.  However,  streaming  data  files  during  acquisition  can provide significant time savings (hours to days).

## Streaming

## XCMS Data Analysis Example

Following  the  steps  of  data  acquisition,  peak-picking  and  nonlinear alignment, subsequent processes in untargeted metabolomics typically  involve  statistical  analysis  to  identify  dysregulated  peaks associated with a specific phenotype, as well as metabolite annotation/identification. Figure  7.5 provides  an  overview  example of  an  experiment  where  untargeted  metabolomic  data  was  used  to understand how arterial and venous blood differs.

Figure 7.5. Representative example of untargeted metabolomics, Julijana Ivanisevic analyzed metabolites in human arterial and venous blood, both collected from the same subjects. EICs show glutamate higher in arterial blood while lactate was higher in venous (unsurprisingly as it is a muscle waste product).

<!-- image -->

Computational metabolite annotation aims to provide chemical information  about  the  observed  features.  This  annotation  process typically entails determining which features correspond to the same metabolite, characterizing the nature of the features (e.g., discerning if  a  feature  represents  a  protonated/deprotonated  species,  a  cation or  anion  adduct,  an  in-source  fragment,  an  isotope,  a  dimer,  etc.), and offering putative metabolite identifications.

An example of the basic annotation process involves comparing the m/z  values  of  the  observed  features  with  a  database  to  determine their potential identity. However, this approach is considered relatively  inaccurate,  and  in  the  forthcoming  chapter,  we  will  delve into more advanced techniques that utilize fragmentation information however Figure 7.5 provides a representative example of how intact m/z data of the precursor ion combined with fragmentation data from MS/MS experiments allow for identification of glutamate and lactate.

## XCMS Cloud Plot

Figure 7.6. A cloud plot with each circle representing a feature that was dysregulated, the size and the intensity of the color represent fold change and p-value, respectively. Additional data can be accessed by clicking on each circle.

<!-- image -->

XCMS also has a unique display feature in it  cloud  plot,  the  cloud plot ( Figures 7.6 and 7.7 ) provides bubbles or circles that represent dysregulated  features  within  a  data  set.  The  size  of  the  bubble denotes fold change and the intensity of the color denotes p-value. How the values are displayed can be adjusted within the scale bar ( Figure 7.6 )  to  filter  based  on  p-value, intensity, m/z  range and RT range, at your discretion.

Figure 7.7. Interactive cloud plot with customized metabolomic data visualization. When a user scrolls the mouse over a bubble, feature assignments are displayed in a pop-up window (m/z, RT, p-value, fold change) with potential METLIN hits. When a bubble is selected by a mouse click, its  EIC,  box -whisker plot,  and  MS  spectrum  appear  on the  bottom  of  the main panel.

## XCMS Meta Analysis

Another  feature  of  XCMS  is  meta  analysis  ( Figures  7.6  and  7.8 ). Mass spectrometry-based  untargeted metabolomics often results in the  observation  of  hundreds  to  thousands  of  features  that  are differentially regulated between sample classes. A major challenge in interpreting  the  data  is  distinguishing  metabolites  that  are  causally associated  with  the  phenotype  of  interest  from  those  that  are

unrelated  but  altered  in  downstream  pathways  as  an  effect.  To facilitate this distinction, meta-analysis has been incorporated within XCMS for  performing  second-order  ('meta')  analysis  of  untargeted metabolomics data from multiple sample groups representing different models of the same phenotype.

The putative identity of those metabolites, is verified by MS/MS matching to standards in METLIN.

While  the  original  version  of  XCMS  was  designed  for  the  direct comparison of two sample groups, meta-analysis enables an unlimited  number of sample classes to facilitate prioritization  of  the data and increase the probability of identifying metabolites causally related  to  the  phenotype  of  interest.  Meta-analysis  across  multiple datasets  is  filtered,  aligned,  and  ultimately  compared  to  identify shared metabolites that are up- or down-regulated across all sample groups.

## What's Going on Inside XCMS

The  XCMS  computational  workflow  combines  peak  picking  with alignment  and  is  accessible  as  both  an  R  package  and  a  cloudbased resource. The cloud-based version provides an intuitive visual interface, enabling users to share data with the scientific community or collaborators. Moreover, it encompasses a comprehensive suite of

tools that facilitate systems biology analysis and metabolite annotation. Notably, XCMS now integrates with the METLIN spectral library (Chapter 9), enabling improved annotation capabilities. Additionally, a  targeted  metabolomics  version  of  XCMS  Online, known as XCMS-MRM, is also available for focused metabolomics investigations.

In LC-ESI-MS, each identified molecule generates multiple chromatographic peaks. Typically, when employing common untargeted metabolomics chromatographic methods, a single molecule will generate a protonated or deprotonated species. Additionally,  various  phenomena  like  isotopes,  adducts,  and  insource fragments may also be observed. Notably, in-source fragmentation,  a  frequent  occurrence  in  LC-ESI-MS,  leads  to  the detection  of  fragments  or  neutral  losses.  Some  of  these  neutral losses, known  as  common  neutral  losses  (e.g.,  -H2O,  -NH3,  HCOOH), are observed across a broad range of organic molecules found in biological systems. Less commonly observed peaks include dimers  or  multimers.  Overall,  LC-MS  generates  complex  datasets typically  report  tens  of  thousands  of  metabolite  features  detected. The effective attribution of all these  peaks to bona  fide metabolites remains an active area of research.

## XCMS Workflow

XCMS serves  as  a  computational  tool  that  combines  peak  picking and alignment to generate a comprehensive list of features from raw MS data ( Figures  7.9 ).  Peak  picking  is  a  computational  procedure employed  to  detect  peaks  in  the  MS  data  and  calculate  their integrated  area.  Traditionally,  two  types  of  peak  picking  algorithms have gained popularity: the match filter algorithm  and its advanced variation  for  high-resolution  mass  spectrometry  data,  known  as  the centWave algorithm. XCMS provides the option to utilize either the original  match  filter  algorithm  or  the  centWave  algorithm.  In  this section, we will delve into the details of these two algorithm types.

## Peak Alignment

When peaks are detected in raw MS data across multiple samples, it is  desirable  for  the  same  peak  originating  from  a  specific  ion  to appear consistently across the different samples, albeit with varying intensities. Modern mass spectrometers, such as TOF and Orbitrap instruments,  offer  high  accuracy,  resulting  in  m/z  values  exhibiting variations as low as 1 ppm  across  samples.  Conversely,  the retention time tends to have larger variations among samples. Peaks from the same ion detected in different samples need to be aligned and grouped, which involves assigning their respective areas to the same row in a data matrix, enabling quantitative comparisons across samples.  XCMS  accomplishes  this  peak  alignment  through  a  twostep  process  referred  to  as  peak grouping  and  retention  time alignment, which we will elucidate in the following sections.

Once  peaks  are  detected  and  aligned,  statistical  analyses  can  be employed  to  identify  features  that  display  statistically  significant changes  in  peak  areas  between  different  phenotypes.  However, following  peak  picking  and  alignment,  it  is  common  to  encounter missing values, which affect more than 80% of the detected features. This  implies  that  approximately  80%  of  the  detected  features  will have missing values for certain samples, indicating zero peak area or  intensity.  Such  occurrences  arise  when  the  ion  peak  falls  below the  detection  limit  in  a  given  group  of  samples.  In  other  cases,  the peak  may  be  observed  above  the  detection  limit,  but  the  peak picking algorithm fails to detect it due to low intensity or interference from  noise  or  coeluting  peaks.  The  presence  of  missing  values reduces the power of statistical tests and analyses and can lead to biased results. This issue becomes  especially pertinent when conducting  multivariate  analyses,  as  missing  values  can  introduce bias  into  the  results.  To  address  this  problem,  various  strategies,

collectively known as missing value imputation strategies, have been devised. One widely accepted approach is known as "filling peaks," wherein  "missing"  peaks  are  re-examined  in  the  raw  data.  XCMS adopts a fill peaks strategy to "fill" the "missing" peaks in the feature list, and we will provide a detailed explanation of this strategy in the subsequent sections.

The subsequent sections explain the different steps comprising the XCMS workflow, which include (1) peak picking, (2) peak grouping and retention time alignment, and (3) fill peaks.

## XCMS Workflow - Peak Picking

Peak  picking  is  a  crucial  step  in  identifying  the  chromatographic peaks  originating  from  molecules  eluting  from  the  chromatographic column. Traditionally,  peak  picking  algorithms  have  been  based  on filtering  techniques  that  remove  noise  from  the  signal,  enabling  the identification  of  distinct  peaks  within  the  raw  data.  Numerous  peak picking  algorithms  have  been  developed,  some  tailored  for  specific types  of  data.  In  the  case  of  LC-MS  data,  peak  detectors  must process the complex three-dimensional LC-MS data to detect these peaks.  Certain  algorithms,  like  the  "centWave"  algorithm,  require data  reduction  prior  to  analysis.  This  reduction  involves  converting the data, typically acquired in profile mode, into centroid mode data. Conversion  can  significantly  reduce  the data  size and  simplify subsequent processing. While most instrument vendors provide their own centroiding algorithms, open-source alternatives are also available.  However,  caution  should  be  exercised  when  using  these alternative algorithms to retain mass accuracy.

In XCMS, two algorithms, namely Matched Filter and centWave, can be employed for peak picking.

## XCMS Workflow - Matched Filter Peak Picking

The  original  peak  detection  algorithm  of  XCMS  follows  a  step-bystep process. First, the algorithm employs a "binning" procedure to

divide  the  data  into  bins  of  0.1  m/z  units  (determined  by  the  step parameter). Within each bin, peaks are identified by surpassing the signal-to-noise threshold specified by the S/N ratio cutoff parameter (default value: 10). The algorithm takes advantage of the characteristic Gaussian-like  shape  of  chromatographic  peaks  to identify  them.  Data  points  that  conform  well  to  a  second  derivative Gaussian (resembling a normal distribution) are classified as peaks. The  width  of  this  Gaussian  is  determined  by  the  full  width  at  half maximum (FWHM) parameter, expressed in seconds. Lower FWHM values increase the likelihood of false positive peak detection, where noise  is  erroneously  identified  as  a  peak.  To  prevent  peaks  from being split between adjacent m/z bins, the algorithm combines pairs of  consecutive  bins.  Originally  designed  for  data  acquired  by  lowresolution  instruments  like  single  quadrupole  mass  spectrometers with a maximum  mass  accuracy  of  approximately  0.1  Da,  the centWave  algorithm  is  recommended  for  current  high-resolution mass  spectrometers  (HRMS)  (explained  below).  However,  if  the MatchedFilter algorithm is applied to HRMS data, the binning value should be significantly reduced. The output of the algorithm is a peak list containing the m/z and retention time (along with their deviations) as  well as  the  integrated  peak  intensity  (peak  area)  for  each identified peak.

## XCMS Workflow - CentWave Peak Picking

First  introduced  in  2008,  the  "centWave"  algorithm  is  specifically designed  for  high-resolution  mass  spectrometry,  offering  superior mass accuracy peak detection. This algorithm comprises two steps to  identify  peaks.  In  the  initial  step,  a  dynamic  binning  approach  is applied to identify regions  of  interest (ROIs) that potentially contain peaks ( Figure  7.10 ).  The  subsequent  step  involves  peak  detection within these ROIs  using  a highly sensitive wavelet filter. The algorithm searches for ROIs characterized by low m/z deviations and intensity profiles that exhibit an increase and subsequent decrease. Key parameters influencing this behavior include the "ppm" parameter, which defines the m/z range of the ROIs, and the peak width,  measured  in  seconds,  which  determines  the  duration  of  the peak in the chromatographic time domain. Once a qualifying ROI is identified,  it undergoes  analysis by the wavelet filter.  The  Mexican

hat wavelet is employed as the model for the peak shape, enabling the  detection  of  multiple  closely  eluting  peaks  within  the  ROI.  The peak scale or height is adjusted until the best fit is achieved. If the fitting criteria are not met, the ROI is rejected as a peak. The output of the centWave algorithm is comparable to that of the MatchedFilter, providing information on the m/z, retention time (including deviations), and integrated intensities of the detected peaks.

Figure 7.10. CentWave peak detection overview. First, regions of interest (ROI) are detected. For each detected ROI, a wavelet filter is applied and peaks within the ROI are detected.

## XCMS Workflow - Peak Alignment

Alignment  In  XCMS,  peak  alignment  ( Figure  7.11 )  involves  a  twostep  process:  peak  grouping  and  alignment  across  samples.  The order in which these steps are executed depends on the alignment algorithm used.

<!-- image -->

Figure 7.11. Revisiting Colin's original figures that nicely illustrate the nonlinear peak

<!-- image -->

alignment impact on the data, and therefore improving statistical analysis.

When  the  original  "peakGroups"  alignment  method  is  selected, peaks are initially grouped into features. This grouping is performed by  the  "peakDensity"  algorithm,  which  operates  on  the  processed peak list rather than the raw data. Utilizing thin m/z slices (defined by the  "mzwid"  parameter),  the  algorithm  identifies  groups  of  peaks across  samples  that  cluster  around  a  specific  retention  time  (RT). The objective is to identify "well-behaved" peak groups (WBPG) that can  serve  as  a  basis  for  aligning  the  remaining  chromatograms, thereby enhancing the accuracy of peak grouping. To identify these WBPG, the  algorithm  employs  a  kernel  density  filter  that  identifies regions  with  clusters  of  "well-behaved"  peaks.  The  filter's  behavior can  be  adjusted  using  the  "bw"  parameter  or  bandwidth,  which  is defined  in  seconds.  For  HPLC  data,  a  common  default  value  is  30 seconds. WBPG should be distributed throughout the retention time to facilitate effective nonlinear correction. Using the median retention time of each  WBPG,  an  alignment  profile  is  created  using a regression technique called LOcally Estimated Scatter-plot Smoother (LOESS). LOESS fits a smoothed line through each chromatogram and  compares  these  smoothed  lines  across  chromatograms  to correct the retention time across samples.

An alternative to the nonlinear retention time alignment algorithm is the "obiwarp" algorithm, introduced. Unlike the pregrouping approach,  "obiwarp"  directly  aligns  peaks  across  samples.  This

algorithm  employs  dynamic  programming  to  determine  the  best alignment  between  two  chromatograms.  It  operates  in  a  pairwise manner, first establishing  a median retention profile  across multiple chromatograms  and  then  iteratively  aligning  all  chromatograms  to that median profile. It is worth noting that the "obiwarp" algorithm can be computationally intensive and time-consuming.

Regardless  of  the  chosen  retention  time  alignment  algorithm,  the subsequent step involves grouping the peaks to generate features, which are defined as a single or a set of peaks across samples with a unique RT and m/z. The aforementioned "peakDensity" algorithm can be employed once again to accomplish this task. With the peaks now aligned, the "bw" parameter can be significantly reduced. As an additional robustness filter, the "minfrac" parameter comes into play. This  parameter  specifies  that,  for  any  given  class  (e.g.,  KO  for knockout,  WT  for  wild  type),  there  must  be  a  minimum  fraction  of peaks present in a feature for it to be considered valid. For example, if  there  are  6  samples  in  the  KO  class  and  6  samples  in  the  WT class, and the "minfrac" is set at 50%, there must be at least 3 peaks present in either class for a particular m/z and RT combination to be considered a valid feature. It's important to note that it applies to "any one class" and not both classes. Therefore, even if KO has 3 peaks and  WT  has  0,  it  would  still  be  deemed  a  valid  feature.  This parameter  can  enhance  robustness  when  searching  for  peaks across all samples.

## XCMS Workflow - Fill Peak

As mentioned earlier, there are two primary reasons why peaks may be missed. Firstly, the algorithm might fail to correctly detect or align the  peak,  or  the  peak  could  be  below  the  detection  limit.  The  fill peaks step effectively addresses these issues by utilizing information from other samples where the peak has been successfully detected (retention time and m/z). When the problem lies with the algorithm, the fill peaks step will accurately identify and recover missing peaks by  leveraging  the  data  from  these  reference  samples.  In  cases where  the  peak  is  below  the  detection  limit,  the  fill  peaks  step employs  the  background  noise  in  the  corresponding  region  to estimate  the  missing  peak  value.  It  is  worth  noting  that  a  peak's absence  in  one  class  of  samples  and  its  presence  in  others  may have biological implications. Therefore, the user has the flexibility to

define the minimum number of peaks required to be found within a single class, accommodating such scenarios.

## XCMS R Package

XCMS, an open-source R package, has an active community that continuously updates and enhances its capabilities. The R version of XCMS provides a command line interface, allowing users to directly interact with their data using a set of commands. In this chapter, we have included workflows for both the original and alternative pipelines.

The  latest  version  of  XCMS,  referred  to  as  XCMS  3  to  avoid confusion with XCMS 2 , leverages new R capabilities, packages, and objects to optimize memory usage. Unlike its predecessor, XCMS 3 does not load entire raw data files into memory but selectively loads the necessary portions, significantly reducing memory requirements. Moreover, the new object system enables users to save their object files and track the history of data processing methods applied to the object.

XCMS  Online, introduced in 2012, offers a cloud-based and graphical system  for utilizing XCMS.  This  web-based  platform eliminates the need for local hardware resources and facilitates easy data sharing among users. It provides users with simple options to set up data processing workflows, accommodating various experiment types through different job types:

Single job : Analyzing a single file or a single class of data.

Pairwise  job :  Comparing  two  classes,  such  as  knockout  vs.  wildtype experiments, with parametric or nonparametric statistical choices and options for unpaired or paired samples.

Multigroup job :  Ideal for time series experiments involving multiple classes,  employing  ANOVA  or  Kruskal-Wallis  statistical  tests  with post hoc analysis.

## XCMS Guided Systems Biology

A  systems-level  analysis  ( Figure  7.12 )  is  also  useful  for  gaining important  insights into the underlying  biochemical  mechanisms. XCMS Online offers a unique capability to project metabolomics data onto  metabolic  pathways  and  integrate  it  with  transcriptomics  and proteomics data, enabling a comprehensive understanding of cellular processes. Traditionally,  projecting  quantitative  metabolic  data  onto metabolic  networks  requires  prior  identification  of  metabolites,  a labor-intensive  task  relying  on  manual  effort  and  expert  curation. However,  XCMS  Online  introduces  an  innovative  approach  called Mummichog leverages biochemical information to annotate features and  map  them  onto  metabolic  pathways,  bypassing  the  need  for metabolite identification. This automated predictive pathway analysis method empowers scientists to interpret the data, formulate biochemical mechanisms, and generate hypotheses, which can then be confirmed through tandem MS analysis.

## METLIN

## Perspective

Untargeted mass spectrometry metabolomics studies heavily rely on accurate databases to effectively identify metabolic features. By harnessing distinct fragmentation patterns, researchers can obtain valuable structural information for specific metabolites and molecular classes. In this chapter, we present the evolutionary journey of METLIN ( Figure 8.1 ) as a comprehensive tandem mass spectrometry resource for small molecule analysis. Moreover, we discuss tools such as fragment similarity searching and neutral loss searching as they are employed to query METLIN, along with their corresponding workflows for the identification of uncharacterized molecular entities. Additionally, we describe other METLIN functionalities of a neutral loss database generated from MS/MS data, an extensive database of isotopic metabolites, an LC retention time database using reversed phase, a collision cross section database from ion mobility, and a multiple reaction monitoring database which aims to streamline the analysis of quantitative mass spectrometry data.

Figure 8.1. The logo that has come to represent METLIN is derived from its origins as a MS/MS database (right) of common endogenous metabolites. However, since 2005 it has grown to contain a vast array of molecules from over 350 chemical classes. METLIN is now widely used a a platform for identifying all types of molecules. It (like XCMS) originated with Colin Smith's efforts, however Winnie Uritboonthai (data acquisition) and Aries Aisporna (informatics) are the primary movers behind over 99% of METLIN's data content.

## 8. METLIN

Over the past two decades, the biological chemistry community has directed its attention towards endogenous metabolites, recognizing their significance in diagnostics, biomarker discovery, and activity. However, the utilization of mass spectrometry or metabolomics for these purposes posed several technical challenges. In particular, researchers worldwide faced significant obstacles in the characterization/identification of metabolites and other chemical entities. This chapter specifically focuses on the METLIN database and its associated tools. METLIN has evolved from its initial stage with only a few hundred metabolites to the current version, having a vast collection of experimental data on over 930,000 compounds as of January 2024 ( Figure 8.2 ).

Figure 8.2. METLIN now encompasses experimental data on over 900,000 molecular standards. With success rate of over 80% on the standards, this translates into over 1.2 million molecules having been analyzed, each at four collision energies (O, 10, 20, 40 eV) and in positive and negative ionization modes.

## METLIN-MS/MS

The METLIN-MS/MS database was originally developed with the primary objective of supporting metabolomic and lipidomic research across various disciplines, particularly aiding in the identification of metabolites in LC-MS-based metabolomics and bridging the gap between genomics, proteomics, and other "omics" sciences. The identification process for genes and proteins in genomics and

proteomics experiments has been made possible through the predictive sequencing of nucleosides and amino acids, as well as the collaborative efforts of their respective communities. In contrast, the metabolome exhibits extensive chemical diversity and a vast array of molecular entities, making it challenging to predict fragmentation patterns (MS/MS) in MS-based experiments and thereby limiting the ability to make accurate identifications.

Since its inception in the early 2000s, METLIN-MS/MS has witnessed continuous growth in terms of the number of metabolites and MS/MS spectra, accompanied by the integration of new tools. After its public release in 2005, METLIN gradually expanded to over 10,000 metabolites with their corresponding MS/MS spectra in 2012, to where it stands now at over 900,000 ( Figure 8.2 ). The database has various tools to facilitate and automate the identification of both known and unknown metabolites as will be described.

Figure 8.3. A crude visual representation the over 350 chemical classes and the experimental data on over 900,000 molecular standards within METLIN.

Alongside METLIN, several other academic, public, and private entities have developed metabolite/small molecule databases, categorized as either pathway-centric or compound-centric. METLIN however has adopted the approach of including any molecular entity as our lab believes that METLIN is a resource that is beyond metabolomics, and rather for all chemical entities ( Figure 8.3 ).

METLIN-MS/MS also differs from other databases in its novel means of data collection and curation. All METLIN-MS/MS data is acquired

## 8. METLIN

at the Scripps Center for Metabolomics, adhering to strict protocols and employing standard reference materials that are commercially available or synthesized. Unlike other databases, METLIN does not use complex biological samples for reference fragmentation spectra to ensure minimal interference and optimal spectral quality. Over the years, METLIN has expanded its coverage to include molecular standards from a diverse range of molecular classes and biological or chemical origins. Therefore, METLIN offers a wide spectrum of small molecules, encompassing endogenous metabolites such as lipids, amino acids, nucleotides, and carbohydrates, toxicants, drugs, drug secondary metabolites, with molecules from over 350 chemical classes ( Figure 8.3 ). The value of MS/MS data is demonstrated ( Figure 8.4 ) where the redundancy of hits from 'identifications' based solely on precursor mass is high, even with absolute accuracy (no error to four decimal places). Tandem MS/MS data greatly reduces the number of hits.

## METLIN-MS/MS Basic Search Engines

<!-- image -->

Figure 8.5. METLIN has multiple forms of searching with its 'Simple Search' and 'Advanced Search' capabilities using precursor m/z , chemical class, elemental composition, adducts, MS/MS and NL data.

|                                                  | METLIN Advanced Search   |
|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| m/z (tolerance, ppm error) elemental composition | chemical class           |

In a traditional untargeted metabolomics workflow, dysregulated features, represented by specific m/z values and their corresponding retention time values, are typically searched against a database to identify putative metabolites based on accurate mass. METLIN offers multiple search options within its Simple and Advanced Search ( Figure 8.5 ). The Simple Search enables the search of m/z values and neutral masses within a selected mass tolerance ( Figure 8.6 ). METLIN allows the selection of several adducts in both positive and negative polarities. Similarly, the Batch Search provides the same functionalities as the Simple Search but allows the simultaneous search of multiple m/z values, facilitating the annotation of adducts and common losses associated with the same metabolite. This feature also helps differentiate ions originating from different molecules and link them to other putative m/z values.

On the other hand, the Advanced Search allows users to search based on additional information such as molecular formula, compound names, SMILES, KEGG, CAS, and MID numbers. These search options generate a list of metabolite names (or molecular

formulas) that could potentially correspond to the dysregulated feature of interest. However, due to the limited elemental diversity in biomolecules (C, H, N, O, P, and S), this list can contain numerous putative metabolite identifications, ranging from tens to hundreds.

## METLIN Identification via MS/MS Matching

The identification includes accurate mass of the compound compared to the theoretical mass based on the compound's molecular formula. Retention time is also used. Most notably, assignment is highly weighted on MS/MS data.

## 8. METLIN

To refine the list of putative identifications obtained from m/z precursor ion searching, retention time, experimental MS/MS spectra which are compared against respective spectral libraries fragmentation patterns ( Figure 8.7 ). The MS/MS Spectrum Match Search tool allows for autonomous metabolite identification. Users upload the fragmentation profile as a table of m/z values and intensities, along with the precursor mass within a specific tolerance, collision energy, and polarity.

This tool then searches, compares, and scores the similarity of the experimental spectra with the reference spectra in the library for all metabolites within the selected mass tolerance,  utilizing a modified X-Rank  similarity  algorithm.  Undoubtedly,  the  collection  of  over 1,000,000 molecular standards with corresponding MS/MS spectra is METLIN's  most  valuable  contribution  to  metabolomics  research. These spectra have been acquired at four different collision energies (0, 10, 20, and 40 eV). In METLIN this is performed in both positive and negative ionization modes.

In the realm of identifying unknown metabolites, spectral libraries serve a dual purpose. As previously mentioned, these libraries primarily facilitate identification by comparing experimental spectra with reference spectra, enabling identification up to level 2 according to the Metabolomics Standards Initiative. However, despite significant efforts to expand their populations, no library can claim completeness due to the vast number of metabolites and the diverse range of chemistries. In fact, the exact count of metabolites in nature (animals, plants, eukaryotes, prokaryotes and fungi) remains a topic of debate, although estimates in the millions are not exaggerated. Such numbers greatly surpass the approximately 20,000 genes and proteins.

Therefore, spectral libraries serve a second crucial purpose: assisting in the identification and characterization of both known metabolites lacking MS/MS spectra and unknown metabolites that have not been previously documented in any library or resource. To fulfill this purpose, two tools, namely Fragment Similarity Search and Neutral Loss Search, have been developed and continuously enhanced over the past 11 years. These tools capitalize on the vast amount of spectral information available and exploit the similarities in

dissociation routes among compounds with related structures and chemical moieties ( Figure 8.8 ).

In this context, we present an illustrative example showcasing the utilization of these tools for the identification of unknown metabolites. Following unsuccessful attempts to identify a specific metabolic feature through accurate mass and MS/MS spectra matching, we turned to the Fragment Similarity Search and Neutral Loss Search tools to obtain structural information and thereby gain insights into the molecular identity. The subsequent steps involved:

We utilized the Fragment Similarity Search tool to search for selected fragments from the MS/MS spectrum of the unknown metabolite ( Figure 8.8 ). These fragments, namely 179.03, 235.10, 299.09, and 355.15, were chosen based on their higher intensity, which indicates their potential to provide valuable structural information. The analysis yielded multiple hits in the METLIN database, with xanthohumol matching all four fragments, suggesting the presence of a metabolite containing a similar chemical structure or moieties.

Assuming that the presence of xanthohumol represents a part of the molecule of interest, calculating the mass difference between the precursor ion and this potential glucuronide fragment (531.18 355.15 = 179.03), we employed the Neutral Loss Search tool within a selected ppm window to search for fragments with a mass of 179.03. Most of the Neutral Loss Search results indicated molecules containing glucuronide, suggesting that glucuronide may be the second component of the unknown metabolite.

## METLIN Similarity Searching to Characterize Unknowns

Figure 8.8. Fragment Similarity Search facilitates the identification of unknown metabolites where no MS/MS spectral data are available. The fragments of an unknown metabolite were searched against METLIN and four fragments were found to match with xanthohumol. The comparison between experimental and library MS/MS spectra implies high structural similarities and further analysis of neutral loss was consistent with xanthohumol glucuronide.

## METLIN - NL

Neutral loss (NL) spectral data presents a mirror of MS/MS data ( Figure 8.9 ) and is a valuable yet largely untapped resource for molecular discovery and similarity analysis. Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) data is effective for the identification of known molecules and the putative identification of novel, previously uncharacterized molecules (unknowns). Yet, MS/MS data alone is limited in characterizing structurally related molecules. To facilitate unknown identification and complement the METLIN-MS/MS fragment ion database for characterizing structurally related molecules, we have created a MS/MS to NL converter to generate METLIN-NL. Mirroring MS/MS data to generate NL spectral data offers a unique dimension for chemical and metabolite structure characterization. METLIN-NL (NLintensity vs. delta m/z ) spectra was generated by calculating the difference between the precursor and fragment ions with NLintensity based on the original fragment ion intensities.

Figure 8.9. Tandem MS and NL spectra mirror each other and thus NL offers an alternative dimension in characterizing molecules.

<!-- image -->

To test the utility of METLIN-NL we examined two structurally related oxylipins. Oxylipins represent a class of highly active lipid metabolites ubiquitous in humans and plants, and specifically, the phytoprostanes (PhytoPs) class of oxylipins resemble prostaglandinlike compounds that are found in seeds and vegetable oils derived from oxidative cyclization of Î± -linolenic acid. Since PhytoPs are a class of highly structurally related oxylipins and are suspected to have additional unidentified analogs, we chose them to demonstrate the utility of METLIN-NL.

Tandem MS and NL data were recently generated on a set of PhytoPs, including the structural analogs 16-B1-PhytoP and 16-keto 16-B1-PhytoP ( Figure 8.10 ). When trying to extrapolate/correlate the observed tandem MS spectra of the two PhytoPs, classic similarity searching was of very limited value providing only one overlapping ion. This exemplifies that two structurally very similar molecules can yield highly different MS/MS spectra limiting similarity searching possibilities and thereby severely impacting the usefulness of this approach for the identification of chemically closely related substances. However NL similarity analysis yielded multiple overlapping NLs ( Figure 8.10 ) and helped to easily correlate the two molecules.

Figure  8.10  NL  and  MS/MS  data  on  two  very  similar  oxylipins  (16  keto  16-B1-PhytoP and 16-B1-PhytoP). The NL spectra with the neutral loss data shows a high degree of similarity while the MS/MS data has only one significant overlapping fragment. (in red).

## METLIN - Iso

METLIN-Iso in parallel with the development of METLIN has been introduced to leverage the expanding number of analytical standards available in METLIN. Created in 2014, METLIN-Iso serves as a database for isotope incorporated metabolites. With a user-friendly interface akin to METLIN, METLIN-Iso provides accurate mass information for all computed isotopologs present in METLIN,

encompassing compounds with varying numbers of isotope-labeled atoms and, consequently, different m/z values. The METLIN-Iso Search feature includes the stable isotopes in labeling experiments, such as 13C, 15N, 2H, and 18O, can be distinguished through accurate mass measurements, further analysis of their MS/MS spectra is crucial for determining the precise position of the isotopic label within the same isotopologs. This feature can be useful for investigating metabolic pathways. To address this need, METLIN-Iso encompasses the MS/MS spectra of hundreds of isotopomers (i.e., the same isotopologs with different locations of labeled atoms). The collection of spectra aids in the tracking of isotopic labels and provides comprehensive information regarding the de novo synthesis of metabolites within specific pathways. While the primary application of METLIN-Iso revolves around the analysis of stable isotopes in labeling experiments, it also offers a wealth of insights into metabolic pathways and their intricate dynamics.

## MS/MS C13 labeled vs unlabeled

Figure 8.11 Systematic generation of MS/MS spectra of uniformly labeled metabolites in isoMETLIN. C13-labeled and labeled glucose, producing uniformly labeled metabolites. The MS/MS spectra help structure elucidation by using the number of carbons that are labeled in each fragment.

<!-- image -->

It is worth noting that because of the cost of isotopically labeled molecules and the very limited collection of available molecules, METLIN-Iso is not nearly as extensive as METLIN-MS/MS and contains a few thousands of molecules.

Similar to METLIN, METLIN-Iso has fragmentation spectra acquired from qToF instruments at various collision energies using authentic isotope-labeled standards. However, one major challenge in populating the spectral database with MS/MS spectra of metabolite

## 8. METLIN

isotopologs is the exponential increase in the number of isotopomers with molecular weight (number of atoms), and the limited availability of commercially labeled isotopomers.

Fully labeled MS/MS spectra provide valuable structural information for metabolite identification. By utilizing the mass differences between analogous fragments of isotopologs, it becomes possible to determine the number of carbon atoms in each fragment ( Figure 8.11 ). This information is particularly useful for the identification of metabolites where MS/MS data is not available.

## METLIN - RT

The METLIN-RT library comprises data on over 80,000 molecular standards, it was created since reversed phase (RP) liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS) is one of the more widely used chromatography approaches. One of the functions of METLIN-RT was to help train retention time prediction algorithms using machine learning ( Figure 8.12 ).

## METLIN - MRM

METLIN-MRM comprises small-molecule transitions for multiplereaction monitoring (MRM) generated from our METLIN-MS/MS database. It was developed to streamline absolute quantitation, typically performed using triple quadrupole (QqQ) mass spectrometers configured to monitor specific precursor-product ion transitions. Typically, determining transitions for different target molecules requires optimization with pure standard materials. The METLIN-MRM library provides traditional experimentally optimized transitions and computationally optimized experimental transitions

derived from the METLIN-MS/MS data. Experimentally optimized transitions were acquired for over 1000 molecules in both positive and negative modes following established protocols. These transitions were optimized to achieve maximum sensitivity and selectivity ( Figure 8.13 ).

Figure 8.13. METLIN-MRM. In the METLIN-MRM ranking system, all molecules in the METLIN library with a precursor within a Â±0.7-Da window of the target molecule are compared (for example, leucine is compared with isoleucine and hydroxyproline), and candidate transitions are selected on the basis of their fragment selectivity (blue fragment). Experimental QqQ transitions are optimized by using standard materials and prioritizing high-intensity fragments (sensitivity), which might yield nonspecific fragments (for example, red fragment) and thus misidentifications.

<!-- image -->

In addition to experimentally acquired data, transitions for more than 14,000 and 4700 molecules in positive and negative modes, respectively, were computationally optimized using the METLINMS/MS data. The spectral library was obtained by acquiring spectra at different collision energies on a qToF instrument, and an empirical ranking algorithm was developed to select transitions based on the selectivity (uniqueness of a product fragment for a given molecule) of

## 8. METLIN

empirical MS/MS fragments. This approach allows for highthroughput quantitation analysis, eliminating the need to optimize transitions with standard reference materials. It also reduces errors caused by interfering molecules, as less likely masked transitions are selected. More detailed information about the algorithms and selection process can be found in the main published work.

## METLIN-CCS

Ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) has emerged as an important separation technique for small molecule characterization in biochemical research. The METLIN-CCS database, which includes collision cross section (CCS) values and IMS data for over 27,000 molecular standards representing 79 chemical classes. METLINCCS provides CCS values measured in triplicate in both positive and negative ionization modes, yielding multiple ion types (e.g., M+H+, M+Na+, M+NH4+, [M-H]-, M+Cl-, and M+TFA-) With over 185,000 CCS values, the METLIN-CCS database is a unique resource for small molecule characterization and IMS-based machine learning.

Figure 8.14. General five step workflow used to generate CCS values on the molecular standards.

<!-- image -->

The METLIN-IMS database was designed for three purposes: (1) create a downloadable resource containing thousands of CCS values, (2) provide a basis set of data to train machine learning models, and (3) explore aggregation properties of each standard to provide information on how molecular ions behave in the source and throughout the instrument. The METLIN-CCS database was generated in a five-step process ( Figure 8.14 ) by analyzing molecular standards in triplicate and in both positive and negative ionization mode. The standards represented 79 different molecular classes. Ultimately, ~185,000 CCS values matching ~62,000 unique molecular species and ~28,000 standards were retained for the METLIN-IMS database.

## Overview

METLIN encompasses experimental data on over 900,000 molecular standards spanning 350 molecular classes. The library has been continuously expanded without bias towards any specific class or type of compounds. It includes endogenous metabolites from eukarya (protozoa, yeast, plants, animals, and fungi), archaea, and bacteria domains, modified metabolites, synthetic drugs, and toxicants. The growth of the MS/MS database has recently been exponential, now at over 931,000 in January 2024 with data in both positive and negative ion modes at multiple collision energies. This growth trend is expected to continue for as long as I can find compounds.

In conclusion, this chapter has highlighted the evolution of METLIN from its inception and discussed its tools for metabolite identification. METLIN has successfully adapted and developed its tools to not only aid in the identification of known compounds, with or without MS/MS spectra, but also to enable the discovery of unknown compounds. Additionally, the METLIN family has expanded to include all of the following databases, ordered by size.

## Metabolite Discovery

## Perspective

Metabolite  identification  is  a  significant  challenge  and  also presents  a  valuable  opportunity  in  the  field  of  biochemistry.  The comprehensive  characterization  and  quantification  of  metabolites  in living  organisms  across  the  centuries  ( Figure  9.1 ) have  laid  the foundation for a vast biochemical knowledgebase, contributing to the resurgence of metabolism research in the 21st century. However, the identification of newly observed  metabolites continues to be a persistent obstacle.

Crystallography and NMR spectroscopy have played crucial roles  in  advancing  our  understanding  of  metabolism.  Nevertheless, their  applicability  in  unraveling  the  intricate  details  of  metabolism's fine structure has been limited by the need for sufficient and highly pure materials. Mass spectrometry, particularly when combined with high-performance  separation  techniques  and  emerging  informatics, AI, and database solutions, has emerged as a pivotal technology in metabolite identification ( Figure 9.2 ).

In  this  chapter,  the  historical  approaches  that  have  been employed  to  tackle  the  metabolite  identification  conundrum  will  be briefly  covered  with  an  emphasis  on  role  of  mass  spectrometry  in advancing our understanding of metabolism. Additionally, we discuss how metabolomics is evolving in response to these challenges and how  the  integration  of  AI  technologies  is  shaping  the  future  of metabolite characterization.

## Elemental Composition Structure Determination

The elemental composition determinations of small organic molecules,  including  urea,  lactic  acid,  citric  acid,  and  oxalic  acid ( Figure  9.1 ),  originated  from  the  pioneering  analytical  techniques developed by Boerhaave and Lavoisier in the 1700s. Subsequently, Gay-Lussac and Thenard  made significant improvements to these techniques  in  the  early  1800s.  Initially,  their approach  involved

analyzing  animal  and  food  products  known  to  contain  high concentrations of specific  molecules. For instance, citric acid was sourced from lemons, and lactic acid was extracted from fermented milk. The subsequent steps included the separation and purification of  the  constituents  through  distillation  and  crystallization.  Atomic weights were then derived through combustion analysis. Although these chemical formulas provided valuable insights, they only served as a basis for structural hypotheses.

During the nineteenth century, significant progress was made in determining the molecular formulas of various metabolites. Justus von Liebig's book "Animal Chemistry" played a crucial role in establishing  our  understanding  of  metabolic  reactions,  even  though these reactions had not been observed in vivo at that time. Liebig's work laid the foundation for studying the inter-conversions of simple organic molecules within cells. The use of radioactive isotopes in the twentieth  century  provided  experimental  evidence  for  the  predicted metabolic reactions. Techniques such as crystallography and physico-chemical analysis, including combustion analysis and boiling/melting point determination, contributed to the characterization of substances. Although these efforts didn't always yield confirmed metabolite structures, they were significant intellectual achievements considering the available analytical technologies.  Today,  many  of  these  techniques  and  properties  are still  taught in chemistry and pharmacy studies. Notable examples of reagents  developed  during  the  1800s  include  the  Tollens  test  and the  Marquis  reaction.  The  determination  of  cholesterol's  chemical structure spanned  over  two  centuries,  with  various  researchers making  important  contributions.  The  total  synthesis  of  cholesterol was achieved in 1951/52, nearly 200 years after its initial discovery.

In the 1900s, significant technological advancements revolutionized  biochemical  research.  Developments  such  as  x-ray crystallography, nuclear reactors for artificial radioisotopes, and scintillation  spectrometers  led  to  exponential  growth  in  the  field. Hans  Krebs  discovered  the  TCA  cycle,  acetyl-CoA,  glycolysis,  and steroid biosynthesis. Chromatographic techniques like gas chromatography and high-pressure liquid chromatography emerged. By  1957,  biosynthetic  pathways  for  various  biological  molecules were  elucidated.  Nuclear  magnetic  resonance  (NMR)  and  mass spectrometry (MS) emerged as powerful tools for metabolomics. The

concept of individual biochemical profiles was introduced by Roger J. Williams.  GC/MS  methods  were  developed  to  monitor  metabolites. Electrospray  ionization  (ESI)  and  LC-ESI  MS  paved  the  way  for untargeted metabolomics. Genomics and proteomics gained attention, driving the establishment of systems biology. Bioinformatics  and  data  mining  pipelines  were  developed  for  large datasets.  Despite  these  advances,  the  focus  on  genomics  and proteomics  led to the notion that metabolite investigation was mature. Textbook metabolic pathways became the primary target for biomarker discovery, overshadowing efforts to understand the metabolic machine comprehensively.

Figure 9. 3. Peak detection, alignment, deconvolution, and spectral matching via MS/MS databases of standards, and statistical assessment of metabolomic data followed by known and unknown metabolite identification.  The timeline for unknown  identification can vary from days to years depending on the complexity of the chemical structure. Also, it depends on the complexity of the synthesis and the amount of biological material available. Unknown characterization is not an easy process.

In the 21st century, advances in genomics, proteomics, and bioinformatics  allowed  for  large-scale  analysis  of  DNA/RNA  and proteins. Metabolomics, which focuses on metabolites, lagged behind  due  to  metabolite's  unique  characteristics.  However,  in  the past two decades ( Figure 9.3 &amp; 9.4 ), improved LC-MS/MS techniques coupled with bioinformatics enabled comprehensive metabolome-wide investigations.  Analytical  hardware  improvements increased  metabolome  coverage  despite  challenges  posed  by  the wide concentration range of metabolites. The availability of comprehensive databases for metabolite identification, although still limited,  is  growing  rapidly.  Artificial  intelligence  (AI)  and  machine learning  (ML)  have  emerged  as  powerful  tools  in  metabolomics, aiding in metabolite identification, spectral analysis, and prediction.

Deep  learning  (DL)  and  natural  language  processing  (NLP)  offer additional avenues for data interpretation and knowledge extraction from the scientific  literature.  However,  identifying complex chemical structures  from  limited  numeric  variables  remains  a  challenge,  and empirical  data  and  confirmation  through  orthogonal  techniques  like NMR are still necessary for unequivocal identification.

Emerging technologies such as cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM)  and novel fragmentation  techniques  in  mass spectrometry (MS) hold promise for metabolite identification. Separation  technologies  like  supercritical  fluid  chromatography  and advanced  liquid  chromatography  (LC)  are  advancing  metabolite identification.  Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) remains the gold standard  for  metabolite  identification,  especially  with  sufficient  and pure  material.  Analytical  advancements,  bioinformatic  tools,  and spectral  databases  have  shifted  biology  towards  unbiased  global investigations.  The  presence  of  known  and  unknown  molecules correlated with specific biological conditions has led to the discovery of a "metabolic black matter" that is yet to be fully understood. Stable isotope labeling provide insight into biosynthetic origin and fate.

Figure 9. 4. Multiple centuries passed as we struggled to identify individual metabolites, now in the course of decades the process of identifying metabolites has become more routine. The ongoing challenge is in identifying all metabolites and deconvolving their systems level impact.

## Identifying Metabolites/Lipids (Oleamide):

## Sleep

<!-- image -->

In the early 1990s I performed LC/MS experiments designed to identify molecules  in cerebral spinal fluid associated with sleep, "Chemical  Characterization  of  a  Family  of  Brain  Lipids  That Induce  Sleep"  Science  1995  &amp;  PNAS 1994  ( Figure  9.5 ).  In these studies,  we  aimed  to  identify  and  characterize  compounds  that induce sleep  by  extracting  metabolites  and  lipids  from  the  CSF  of sleep-deprived felines. This was the first LC/MS-based metabolomics  experiments,  although  it  was  not  called  that  at  the time.

Figure 9. 5. Data that was acquired during and since the original sleep study that helped identify  oleamide.

<!-- image -->

Through these experiments, we observed a family of related fatty  acid  amide  lipids,  one  in  particular  stood  out  with  an  m/z  of 282.279 was cis-9,10-octadecenoamide, which is commonly referred to as oleamide. Probably the most significant outcome of this effort was  1)  oleamide  acted  as  a  sleep-inducing  compound  and,  more importantly  2)  the  recognition  of  the  significant  time  it took  to manually analyze the data and identify the metabolites. This served as the springboard behind the creation of XCMS and METLIN.

## Identifying Lipid Neuroprotectin D1: Stem Cells and the 'Plastic Metabolome'

<!-- image -->

This  study  ( Figure  9.6 , Nature  Chemical  Biology  2010)  explored the metabolomic profile and redox regulation in embryonic stem cells (ESCs)  during  differentiation.  By employing  mass  spectrometrybased  metabolomics,  Oscar  Yanes  identified  a  distinct  metabolic signature characterized by highly unsaturated  metabolites in ESCs, which decreased upon differentiation.

In his own words 'Our results reveal that the pluripotent properties of stem  cells  can  be  derived  by  the  low  oxidative  state  of  their metabolomes. The presence of specific highly unsaturated endogenous metabolites confers the necessary chemical plasticity to differentiate into new structural and more oxidized and hydrogenated metabolites  detected  in  mature  populations.  We  postulate  that  the existence of such a 'plastic metabolome' is promoted and maintained by the known hypoxic microenvironments where most of the stem cells reside in living organisms.'

This was demonstrated in the redox status, as indicated by the ratio of reduced and oxidized glutathione and ascorbic acid levels, as well as  the  rich  population  of  unsaturated  lipids  in  stem  cells  ( Figure 9.6 ).  This  data  was  meticulously  generated  using  an  FT-ICR-MS system  that  allowed  for  the  careful  characterization  of  elemental composition  and  thus  the  hydrogen  deficiency  index  (HDI)  which allowed him to discern the high level of unsaturation in stem versus mature cells.

One of the interesting  molecules that came out  of this was neuroprotecting D1. Neuroprotectin D1 (NPD1) is a specialized lipid mediator  derived  from  an  omega-3  fatty  acid.  NPD1  was  found  to significantly promote neuronal differentiation. The researchers supplemented neuronal differentiation media with NPD1 and observed  a  remarkable  increase  of  over  1500%  in  the  number  of tubulin positive neurons,    indicating    enhanced    neuronal

differentiation. This finding suggests that NPD1 plays a crucial role in driving the differentiation of stem cells into neurons.

Figure 9. 6. (top left) The 'plastic metabolome' in stem cells (as compared to mature cells) represented by the index of hydrogen deficiency. One particular metabolite (NPD1, top right and bottom) drives stem cell differentiation 1500% more than controls. The MS/MS data that was acquired since the original study on NPD1 and its comparison to data in METLIN (-20eV) used for the identification.

Interestingly, NPD1 specifically exerted its neurogenic effects, while other pro-inflammatory eicosanoids, such as leukotriene  B4  and  leukotriene  C4,  had  no  significant  impact  on neuronal differentiation. This highlights the specific role of NPD1 in

promoting  neurogenesis.  The  study  also  conducted  preliminary experiments  on  human  ESCs,  which  demonstrated  that  the neurogenic activity of NPD1 is conserved across different species. Overall,  the  findings  of  this  study  suggest  that  endogenous metabolites, particularly NPD1, play a critical role in regulating the differentiation of stem cells into neurons.

## Identifying Metabolite 3-Indole Propionic Acid: Gut Microbiota

<!-- image -->

The human gut microbiome, consisting of trillions of bacteria in  the  distal  intestinal  tract,  plays  a  crucial  role  in  human  health. However,  the  specific  biochemical  effects  of  these  bacteria  on  the host  remain  poorly  understood.  In  this  PNAS  2009  study  ( Figure 9.7 ), a comprehensive metabolomics analysis using mass spectrometry was to investigate the influence of the gut microbiome on mammalian blood metabolites. By comparing plasma extracts from germ-free mice (lacking gut bacteria) to those from  conventional  (wild type)  mice, we identified that roughly 10%  of  the  plasma  metabolome  was  significantly  altered.  A  level of  alteration  I  had  not  previously  experienced  in  our  metabolomic studies.

Figure 9. 7.  One of the more interesting metabolites was 3-indole propionic acid (3IPA). 3-IPA was determined to come solely from the bacteria clostridium sporanges and has since has had over 2000 papers published on its activities.

<!-- image -->

One  particular  group  of  metabolites  affected  by  the  gut microbiome  was  indole-containing  compounds.  For  example,  we observed  major  alterations  in  the  levels  of  tryptophan,  N-acetyl tryptophan,  and  serotonin  in  conventional  mice  compared  to  germfree  mice.  While  the  conversion  of  tryptophan  to  indole  by  specific gut bacteria explained the decrease in tryptophan levels, the increased serotonin levels in conventional mice suggested alternative,  previously  unobserved,  mechanisms.  Most  interesting was  the  observation  of  3-indole  propionic  acid  (3-IPA),  a  potent antioxidant, exclusively in the plasma of conventional mice. While the shear impact of the gut microbiome had on the plasma metabolome was quite surprising in 2009, equally as interesting was the observation  of  gut  specific  metabolites  in  blood.  3-IPA  has  since gained considerable interest with thousands of papers being published on its unique properties, namely:

- Â·  3-IPA is produced by the gut bacteria Clostridium sporogenes via the digestion of tryptophan.
- Â· Neuroprotective properties including antioxidant and antiinflammatory effects in the brain.
- Â·  Impact on intestinal function with evidence suggesting that IPA could influence the integrity of the intestinal barrier.
- Â·  IPA has been investigated in the context of several diseases, including neurological, inflammatory, and metabolic diseases.

## Identifying Lipid N,N-Dimethylsphingosine: Chronic Pain

<!-- image -->

Neuropathic  pain  is a debilitating condition that affects millions of people worldwide, causing persistent pain in response to normally harmless stimuli. Despite its prevalence, effective treatments for neuropathic pain are limited due to a lack of understanding of its underlying chemical basis. Untargeted metabolomics  ( Figure  9.8, Nature  Chemical  Biology  2012)  has

revealed  that  sphingomyelin  metabolism  was  dysregulated  in  the spinal cord of rats suffering from neuropathic pain, specifically in the region  associated  with  pain  processing.  Furthermore,  it  was discovered that an up-regulated metabolite called N,Ndimethylsphingosine (DMS) induced mechanical allodynia, a condition in which non-painful stimuli become painful. These findings provide insight into the chemical mechanisms underlying neuropathic pain and highlight  the potential of targeting sphingomyelin metabolism as a therapeutic strategy.

Figure 9. 8. (top) Tandem mass spectra of DMS standard compared to data acquired from the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. This data was acquired from both QTOF and QqQ (bottom) instrumentation for additional validation.

<!-- image -->

Neuropathic  pain  is  a  challenging  condition  to  treat,  and current  options  often  come  with  side  effects  and  limited  efficacy. While various molecular and cellular changes have been associated

with  neuropathic  pain,  the  exact  molecular  causes  remain  unclear, hindering the development of effective treatments. To address this, the  researchers  employed  mass  spectrometry-based  metabolomics to  analyze  tissue  samples  from  rats  with  neuropathic  pain.  They focused  on  the  chronic  phase  of  pain  and  found  that  a  significant number of metabolic changes occurred specifically in the spinal cord, suggesting its central role in maintaining pain sensitivity.

One  of the most intriguing findings was  the dysregulation of sphingomyelin-ceramide metabolism in the ipsilateral dorsal horn of the spinal cord, the region involved in pain processing. Sphingomyelin metabolism is known to play crucial roles in various cellular  processes,  including  myelin  formation  and  cell  signaling. Dysregulated metabolites in this pathway, such as DMS, were found to be  significantly up-regulated  in  the  spinal  cord  of  rats with neuropathic  pain.  Importantly,  the  researchers  demonstrated  that administration of DMS induced mechanical allodynia in healthy rats, confirming its role in  pain  development.  Additionally,  they  observed that  DMS  triggered  the  release  of  inflammatory  mediators  from astrocytes,  supporting  the  involvement  of  glial  cells  in  neuropathic pain.

Overall,  this  study  sheds  light  on  the  chemical  basis  of neuropathic  pain  and  identifies  the  dysregulation  of  sphingomyelin metabolism,  particularly  the  up-regulated  metabolite  DMS,  as  a potential contributor to pain development. The findings suggest that targeting DMS  production  or its downstream  effects, such as inflammatory mediator release from astrocytes, could be a promising approach for the treatment of neuropathic pain. These insights open up  new  avenues  for  therapeutic  intervention  and  provide  hope  for improving  the  lives  of  individuals  suffering  from  this  debilitating condition.

## 9. Metabolite Discovery

## Identifying Metabolite N1,N12-Diacetylspermine: Bacteria Biofilms Cancer

<!-- image -->

9. Metabolite Discovery

This was a relatively straightforward study, published in Cell Metabolism in 2015 ( Figure 9.9 ),  and was  designed to investigate the role of colonic biofilms in colorectal cancer (CRC) development and their impact   on the tumor microenvironment. Mass spectrometry-based metabolomics was used to analyze CRC tumors and normal-flanking tissues from 30 human patients, focusing on the identification of major metabolites employing untargeted metabolomics  for  discovery  and  targeted  metabolite  profiling  for quantification validation.

The  results  showed  that  N1,N12-diacetylspermine  were upregulated  in  all  tumor  tissues.  However,  its  presence  was significantly enhanced  in  patients with  biofilm-positive  CRC. Targeted metabolite profiling further confirmed its upregulation and other metabolites in the polyamine pathway. NIMS imaging provided spatial  specificity  of  these  metabolites  in  tumor  versus  normal tissues.

Figure 9. 9. Targeted metabolomics concentrations of metabolites in cancers with (red) and without biofilm (green) (n.s.=not significant). Only N1,N12-diacetylspermine was deemed statistically significant.

<!-- image -->

The findings suggest that colonic biofilms can alter the tumor metabolome, resulting in increased levels of polyamines, which are known to regulate cell proliferation and tumor growth. The study highlights the potential biological significance of biofilms in CRC and their impact on the tumor microenvironment.

However, what I found especially intriguing about this study is  that  N1,N12-diacetylspermine  is  a  well-known  biomarker  for  at least  ten  cancers,  this  consistency  implies  a  larger  role  for  this molecule, possibly in immune suppression that the microbiome uses to stay viable.

## Overview

Urea was the starting point in unraveling the complex puzzle of  metabolism,  and  our  understanding  continues  to  grow.  From simple  molecules  like  urea  to more  intricate  ones  like acetyl-CoA, each discovery adds to our mechanistic knowledge. Metabolomics, the youngest  of  the  omics  fields,  has  played  a  vital  role  in  driving these discoveries through advancements in analytics and computation.  These  technologies  enable  us  to  comprehensively characterize metabolites and their metabolism, leading to a deeper understanding  of  how  they  influence  biological  systems.  The potential  of  these  technologies  extends  beyond  characterization; they hold the key to uncovering the biological activities of metabolites in health and disease. The concept of "Activity Metabolomics"  ( Chapter  10 )  aims  to  define  the  kinetics  of metabolism  and  explore  the  biological  effects  of  metabolites. As  activity  metabolomics  emerges,  it  challenges  the  traditional central  dogma  of  molecular  biology  by  recognizing  metabolites as powerful regulators of biological processes. These advancements  pave  the  way  for  a  new  era  of  research,  where metabolites  take  center  stage  as  master manipulators of biology.

## Metabolite Discovery

## Perspective

Metabolite  identification  is  a  significant  challenge  and  also presents  a  valuable  opportunity  in  the  field  of  biochemistry.  The comprehensive characterization  and  quantification  of  metabolites  in living  organisms  across  the  centuries  ( Figure  10.1 )  have  laid  the foundation for a vast biochemical knowledgebase, contributing to the resurgence of metabolism research in the 21st century. However, the identification of newly  observed  metabolites  continues  to  be  a persistent obstacle.

Figure 10.1. A broad depiction of the evolution of metabolic sciences and metabolite identification across the centuries as depicted by technology and (below) an art metaphor to van Gogh (credit Paul Giera).

In  this  final  chapter,  I  describe  an  aspect  of  metabolomics that I have been engaged in now for three decades, namely identifying active metabolites ( Figures 10.1-10.3 ). In particular we have been working toward identifying and understanding how to characterize which metabolites impact cellular physiology through modulation of other 'omic' levels, including  the  genome,  epi-genome,  transcriptome  and  proteome. This concept for identifying biologically active metabolites, or 'activity metabolomics',  and  is  already  having  broad  impact  on biology.

Figure 1 0 .2. In its simplest form, going from dataset comparative analysis to statistical assessment, and finally to activity determination is the goal. Although identifying the best candidates and assessing (and understanding) activity can be time consuming.

<!-- image -->

The  metabolome  transcends  the  genome  and  proteome, representing  the  most  downstream  stage  and  the  information  flow through  these  different  'omic'  levels  of  biochemical  organization  is described  as  the  central  dogma  of  molecular  biology.  Within  this framework,  the  metabolome,  has  become  widely  accepted  as  the dynamic  and  sensitive  measure  of  the  phenotype  at  the  molecular level, placing metabolomics  at the forefront of biomarker and mechanistic discoveries related to pathophysiological processes.

However, the perception of metabolites mainly as a downstream product - biomarkers (of gene and protein activity) - has minimized  the  awareness  of  their  far-reaching  regulatory  activity. Metabolite  activity  is  a  fascinating  aspect  of  metabolism  given  that the metabolome interacts with and actively modulates all other 'omic' levels ( Figure 10.1 ). Through  this interaction metabolites also serve as direct modulators of biological processes and phenotypes. This concept has been investigated for decades, especially through the seminal discoveries of glucose, fatty acids and other lipids as regulators of insulin secretion and sensitivity and nutrient and energy

sensing by the mTOR kinase. These findings have already shown the significant impact metabolites can have on biological systems.

(Middle) Bioinformatics-based analyses with the use of metabolic pathway databases can be applied to assign the candidate metabolites to biochemical pathways. Protein and gene expression data can be further used to support and help in pathway annotation. (Bottom) Metabolites can be tested for bioactivity using a wide variety of assays (Tables 1 and 2).

## How do 'active metabolites' work?

The  active  metabolome  drives  phenotype  modulation  in  a wide variety of ways. Oncometabolites are one of the best examples of active metabolites because of their early discovery and established  mechanisms  of  phenotype  modulation  in  cancer  cells. The  accumulation  of  these  oncometabolites  in  distinct  types  of cancer cells is a causal process in malignant transformation. Oncometabolites, including D-2-hydroxyglutarate, L-2hydroxyglutarate, succinate and fumarate, were found in cancerous tumors  that  had  mutations  in  the  enzymes  (including  Isocitrate

Dehydrogenase (IDH), Fumarase (FH) and Succinate Dehydrogenase (SDH) corresponding to  the  oncometabolites).  The accumulation of the oncometabolites in the tumor cells arising from these mutations resulted in a proliferative cancer phenotype.

These  oncometabolites  are  not  only  biomarkers  of  the diseases, depending on the activity of their respective enzymes, they can modify  and  interact  with  proteins  and  DNA  thereby  alter  the proteome  and  the  epigenome.  Specifically,  the  activity  of  these oncometabolites  stems  from  their inhibition  of  dixoxygenase enzymes  resulting  in  a  phenotype  mirroring  hypoxia,  where  the levels  of  transcription  factor  hypoxia  inducible  factor  (HIF)  are increased despite normal oxygen levels.

In addition  to  enzyme  inhibition,  other  distinct  biological activities for individual oncometabolites have been described. While the  full  scope  of  the  biological  effects  of  oncometabolites  is  still  an active  area  of  investigation,  it  has  been  demonstrated  that  they modulate  protein-protein  interaction,  alter  enzyme  activity,  lead  to changes in the protein posttranslational modifications and modify the epigenome, all with the effect of propagating cancer. Recent mechanistic insights have revealed that metabolites strongly impact all layers of the omics landscape, from the genome, epigenome and transcriptome to the proteome. Within this framework the metabolome has two overarching mechanisms to control the functions  of  DNA,  RNA  and  proteins:  chemical  modification  and metabolite-macromolecule interaction that are further detailed in the following sections.

## Metabolic modification of DNA, RNA and Proteins.

Metabolites  drive  pivotal  covalent  chemical  modifications  of proteins  (post-translational  modifications)  and  of  DNA  and  RNA (such  as  methylation)  which  significantly affect cellular function ( Figure  10.4 ). Post-translational  modifications  of  proteins  involve at least dozens of different small molecules that can be covalently  bound  to  distinct  amino  acids  as  for  instance  lysine acetylation (derived from  Acetyl-CoA)  or  cysteine  palmitoylation (derived from Acyl-CoA). Many other metabolites are responsible  for  post-

translational  modifications  including  UDP-glucose  for  glycosylation, and  itaconate for the alkylation of cysteine residues. Notably, abundance of many of these metabolite-induced protein modifications represent a powerful means of phenotype modulation.

DNA  methylation  (or  a  transfer  of  a  methyl  group  from  SAdenosyl  Methionine  to  cytosine)  starts  during  embryogenesis  and continues  throughout  our  lifespan.  Multiple  metabolites,  such  as  SAdenosyl  Methionine,  glycine,  pyruvate,  galactose  and  threonine function as co-factors for posttranscriptional RNA modifications that act  as  sensors  and  transducers  of  information  to  control  basic metabolic functions.

## Metabolite-macromolecule interactions

Cellular activity can be regulated through noncovalent interactions between metabolites and macromolecules. One way this happens  is  when  a  metabolite  competitively  binds  to  an  enzyme's active  site  or  at  a  different  site,  known  as  allostery  ( Figure  10.5 ). This  concept  applies  not  only  to  enzymes  but  also  to  various molecules  like  messenger  RNAs,  proteins,  and  G-protein  coupled

receptors  (GPCRs),  which  are  important  for  metabolite-activated signaling. GPCRs, for instance, play a crucial role in controlling blood pressure and other specialized cellular activations.

Transcription factors also participate in this regulation, determining  how  the  system  responds  to  cues  by  controlling  the expression of specific genes. Riboswitches are involved in metabolite-controlled transcription and translation, with various metabolites, such as lysine and glutamine, acting as controllers.

Notably,  glucose  sensing  in  the  brain  plays  a  vital  role  in regulating hormone  secretion, neuronal activity, and  behavioral phenotypes related to feeding and energy expenditure. Interestingly, many  active  metabolites  are  typically  considered  common  building blocks of cells,  like  amino  acids for proteins, pyrimidine  and purine bases for nucleic acids, and phospholipids for cell membranes.

Broader roles of metabolome in influencing global gene and protein  activity  have  become  more  evident,  for  example  dietary restriction  in  mouse models have shown profound changes in gene expression and improvement in aging phenotypes. It has also been found that the epigenome is influenced by metabolic status.

In another example, integrated analyses of yeast strains demonstrated that metabolite supplementation largely controls gene and  protein  expression,  suggesting  a  system-wide  regulation  by metabolites.

## Discovering active metabolites

Throughout  history,  metabolite  detection,  identification,  and quantification  have relied  on biochemical approaches. But now, the field  of  metabolomics  opens  up  new  opportinuities  for  discovery  at multiple  levels.  Unraveling  the  identity  of  active  metabolites  is  a crucial aspect of this journey.

Figure 1 0 .6. Metabolite activity demonstrated in stem-cell differentiation, oleamide observed in CSF during sleep deprivation, taurine enhances differentiation into mature oligodendrocytes, as part of a multiple sclerosis treatment, T-cell modulation by a metabolite derived solely from gut bacteria (3-IPA), and pain sensitivity amplified by DMS.

Mass  spectrometry-based  metabolomics,  helps  us  identify features,  annotate  these  features,  statistically  analyze  them,  and generate a list of potential metabolites. A number of peak detection and  alignment  softwares,  like  XCMS  Online,  MZmine2,  Open-MS, and MS-DIAL, are currently available allowing for annotating features and identifying metabolites using databases METLIN.

Further to this, bioinformatic metabolic pathway and network analysis simplifies the complex data, helping us prioritize metabolites involved in distinct modules of the metabolic network can simply the candidate filtering process. And once the candidate lists are established, this metabolomics-guided activity screening is accomplished  using  in  vivo  and  in  vitro  phenotypic,  omics,  and chemical  biology  strategies  to  identify  the  active  metabolites  and understand their mechanism of action.

## Metabolic Activity Screening Strategies

Identifying  active  metabolites  that  modulate  phenotype  can be achieved  through  a variety of effective strategies. Utilizing metabolomics in conjunction with orthogonal molecular biology  and computational approaches has proven to be successful in identifying active metabolites across various studies.

In  each  of  these  examples,  a  crucial  initial  step  involves implementing  an  appropriate  screening  strategy.  These  strategies encompass  gene  expression,  protein  expression,  protein  activity (such  as  enzyme  activity),  and  the  modulation  of  desired  cellular phenotypes. For a comprehensive overview, please refer to Table 1 , which outlines the principles underlying these assays.

In contrast to in vivo studies, cell-based assays offer several advantages, including high throughput capabilities and the ability to analyze  various  aspects  of  cell  biology,  such  as  cell  morphology, biophysical  function,  and  chemical  properties.  These  assays  also benefit  from  the  use  of  molecular  biology  tools  like  fluorescent  or luminescent reporters, providing valuable insights into cellular processes.

In the fields of metabolite-epigenome and metabolitegenome  interactions,  nucleotide  sequencing  approaches,  such  as chromatin  immunoprecipitation  and  sequencing  (ChIP-Seq),  and bisulfite  sequencing  for  detecting  methylated  DNA,  are  commonly employed.  Additionally,  chemical  proteomics  has  emerged  as  a valuable tool to study metabolite-protein interactions. Techniques like protein arrays and thermal proteome profiling (TPP) allow researchers to examine the binding of specific metabolites to various proteins, offering a deeper understanding of cellular processes.

However, some of these screening approaches can be timeconsuming,  costly,  and  restricted  to  specialized  laboratories.  To efficiently  identify  potential  candidates  from  metabolomics  data,  a combination of computational activity prediction strategies and chemical  approaches  can  be  used.  This  approach  accelerates  the assay process and enhances the selection of candidates for further investigation.

Advanced  prediction  methods,  such  as  neural  networks trained  with  large  datasets  from  the  ChEMBL  database,  are  being adopted to predict the bioactivity of  metabolites discovered through exploratory metabolomics. By leveraging this information, researchers can superimpose metabolomics data on activity constraints, optimizing the selection of metabolites for subsequent in vitro and in vivo bioactivity testing.

Additionally, knowledge from drug metabolism studies, which employ sophisticated in silico approaches to predict molecular sites prone  to  metabolic  activation,  can  contribute  valuable  insights  for these endeavors.

Overall, the integration of cell-based  assays,  nucleotide sequencing techniques, chemical proteomics, computational activity prediction, and drug metabolism knowledge offers a comprehensive approach  to  study  metabolite  interactions  and  identify  potential bioactive candidates for further investigation. These combined efforts help streamline the screening process and facilitate the discovery of metabolites with significant biological relevance.

## Multi-omics integration for determining activity

In  addition  to  metabolomics,  the  correlation  and  integration of multi-omic data present  a  useful approach  to  enhance  the selection process of metabolites. By combining metabolite candidates with transcriptomic and proteomic data, researchers can gain  deeper  insights  into  selected  pathways  of  interest.  This  multiomic  integration  has  been  applied  across  diverse  research  areas, ranging from cancer metabolism to plant physiology and microbiology, yielding valuable information about distinct metabolite activities through quantitative modeling. The  aim  is to enable targeted interventions on specific pathways.

To handle the vast  amount of  data  and  reduce  complexity, various  mathematical  approaches  can  be  employed.  For  instance, metabolite and other omics data can be added to curated pathways, or  novel  pathways  and  fluxes  can  be  modeled  using  the  data.  The field of multi-omics integration is continuously evolving, with multiple approaches being explored.

One  common  strategy  in  multi-omics  integration  involves using gene nomenclature linked to unique metabolite identifiers and combining  existing  pathway  information  (e.g.,  KEGG,  Reactome, Biocyc pathways, Recon) with metabolomic set enrichments (available via platforms like MetaboAnalyst) and the newly developed ChemRICH platform. By utilizing this pathway information, researchers can effectively reduce complexity and filter out noise.

However, integrating the metabolome and other omic layers can pose challenges. Complex datasets are often acquired without a preset  integration  strategy.  Addressing  data  robustness,  sample harvest artifacts (batch effects), and distinct features of different omic datasets is crucial. Challenges in multi-omic data integration include noise removal, data prefiltering, matching various identifiers, selecting data dimensionality reduction methods, choosing computational approaches and mathematical models, model validation, and integration into trans-omics network modules. Efficiently advancing  these  approaches  is  an  area of ongoing development.

Metabolic networks face validation challenges due to limited metabolite  coverage  resulting  from  analytical  bias.  Additionally,  the full  potential  of  omics  data  is  not  always  utilized  comprehensively, and  data  sharing  strategies  need  improvement.  However,  multilayered omic strategies, once acquired and integrated, can be highly useful, especially when applied to in vivo metabolism.

The  future  integration  of  genome-scale  modeling,  big  data analysis,  and  machine  learning  strategies  is  anticipated  to  further prioritize metabolite activity in biological systems. In vivo and in vitro modeling  studies  have  already  demonstrated  the  power  of  this integrative omics approach, accurately predicting biological behavior based on multi-layered omic data acquisitions and metabolic phenotypes.  Predictive pathway  analysis  within these platforms allows for straightforward and efficient metabolite mapping to background knowledge databases, be they curated reference pathway databases or genome-scale networks.

It is worth noting that current metabolic spectral databases only cover a fraction (up to 60%) of genome-scale metabolism, indicating a limitation due to the "dark" metabolome.

Ultimately,  these  integrated  approaches  aim  to  generate accurate  biological  models,  allowing  the  identification  of  the  most promising  candidates  for  activity  screening.  The  multidimensional integrated "omic" landscape offers exciting opportunities and unconventional  solutions  for  predicting  metabolites  that  modulate phenotype.

## Perspective: Applications of activity metabolomics

Activity  metabolomics  has  a  broad  range  of  applications, impacting  phenotypes  across  various  organisms,  from  simple

prokaryotes to complex human physiology. Its versatility is exemplified  by  its  ability  to  enhance  biotechnological  applications, such as boosting Bordetella pertussis vaccine and protein production in  E.  coli.  Additionally,  activity  metabolomics plays a significant role in  modulating  the  microbiome,  where  alterations  to  the  mammalian metabolome can influence microbial communities, with microbiomederived metabolites impacting immune cells and satiety.

In the emerging field of immunometabolism, specific metabolites  like  prostaglandin  E2  have  been  found  to  influence immune responses, promoting certain T cell types while suppressing macrophage  and  neutrophil  activity.  At  an  organ  level,  metabolites like  leukotrienes  control  pathophysiological  reactions,  such  as  in asthma. In complex organisms, nutritional interventions, like omega3  fatty  acid  supplementation,  have  shown  multiple  benefits  without severe side effects.

In pharmacology and toxicology, metabolites are administered to reduce toxicity, such as using ethanol to counteract methanol poisoning or administering scavenger metabolites to mitigate  the  effects  of  certain  chemotherapeutics.  Drug  synergies with endogenous metabolite classes are also utilized for therapeutic purposes.  Even  simple  metabolites  like  glutamine  have  proven effective  in  treating  complex  diseases  like  sickle  cell  disease,  as evidenced in phase 3 clinical trials.

These  examples  highlight  the  wide  applicability  of  active metabolites  in  modulating  biological  processes,  cellular  metabolic states, cell activation, differentiation, proliferation, and  complex tissue  functions.  Notably,  the  effect  of  a  metabolite  is  contextdependent, and its  induced  phenotype  can  vary  significantly  based on  the biological system  it is applied to. The  goal  of  activity metabolomics is to provide a framework to understand and systematically quantify these phenotypic changes.

One  such  example  is  Î± -ketoglutarate (AKG),  an  active metabolite that alters phenotypes in a context-dependent manner. It regulates  glucose  metabolism  and  uptake  in  bacteria,  extends  the lifespan in Caenorhabditis elegans through mTOR inhibition, supports  regulatory  T-cell  differentiation  from  Th1  cells  in  immune cells, and enhances tissue and muscle regeneration in humans via

processes  involving  ERK  and  other  factors.  Its  binding  to  the  Gprotein-coupled receptor Oxgr1 translates into increased transporter synthesis and hypertension through salt reabsorption in the kidney. An  overarching  theme  in  these  settings  may  be  the  modulation  of anabolic  cell activity, which  could  be  considered  the  "common denominator" of AKG's role in the activity metabolome.

The  current  challenge  in  activity  metabolomics  is  to  link metabolites systematically and quantitatively to an organism's phenotype ("phenome"). Achieving this goal will necessitate comprehensive  metabolomics  and  phenotypic  data,  as  well  as  the computational  integration  of  other  omic  data.  Through  such  efforts, activity metabolomics  holds  promise in unraveling the intricate connections between metabolites and phenotypes, contributing to a deeper understanding of biological systems, and paving the way for innovative therapeutic strategies.

## Conclusions

Increasing attention is being drawn to the idea that metabolites can act as controllers, not just cogs in a system. Termed "activity metabolomics,"  this  approach  employs  metabolomics  to identify  active  metabolites.  The  central  focus  is  to  identify  master metabolites, achieved through computational integration of metabolomics,  systems  biology,  and  bioactivity  data.  This  enables the identification of potent  metabolites  that modulate  biological processes and cell physiology.

Many  challenges, such as metabolite identification and annotation,  have  already  seen  significant  progress. Figure  10.1 illustrates the goal: leveraging metabolomics-driven screening methods  to  identify  these  master  regulators.  Once  accomplished, activity metabolomics stands to impact multiple scientific disciplines.

## Endogenous Metabolite Success Stories

On  a  final  note,  it  is  worth  mentioning  a  few  of  the  many success  stories  for  highly  recognizable  endogenous  metabolites. These  clinically relevant endogenous  molecules  each  generate hundreds of millions to over ten billion dollars a year in revenue.
