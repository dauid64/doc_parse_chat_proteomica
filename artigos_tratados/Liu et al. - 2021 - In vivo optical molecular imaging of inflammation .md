## Abstract

Inflammation is the phenotypic form of various diseases. Recent development in molecular imaging provides new insights into the diagnostic and therapeutic evaluation of different inflammatory diseases as well as diseases involving inflammation such as cancer. While conventional imaging techniques used in the clinical setting provide only indirect measures of inflammation such as increased perfusion and altered endothelial permeability, optical imaging is able to report molecular information on diseased tissue and cells. Optical imaging is a quick, noninvasive, nonionizing, and easy-to-use diagnostic technology which has been successfully applied for preclinical research. Further development of optical imaging technology such as optoacoustic imaging overcomes the limitations of mere fluorescence imaging, thereby enabling pilot clinical applications in humans. By means of endogenous and exogenous contrast agents, sites of inflammation can be accurately visualized in vivo. This allows for early disease detection and specific disease characterization, enabling more rapid and targeted therapeutic interventions. In this review, we summarize currently available optical imaging techniques used to detect inflammation, including optical coherence tomography (OCT), bioluminescence, fluorescence, optoacoustics, and Raman spectroscopy. We discuss advantages and disadvantages of the different in vivo imaging applications with a special focus on targeting inflammation including immune cell tracking.

Inflammation is an immunological defense response to potentially harmful stimuli or intruders such as pathogens or irritants and acts by removing those injurious stimuli and initiating the healing process [1, 2]. But the immune system can also perceive cells of its own body as harmful, resulting in autoimmune diseases, such as diabetes type I or rheumatoid arthritis. The innate immune response is the first defense mechanism that is activated shortly after infection and orchestrates long-term adaptive immunity. However, an uncontrolled acute inflammation can lead to the progression and pathogenesis of chronic diseases [2, 3]. Therefore, early detection of inflammatory sites is crucial for a timely treatment initiation in order to efficiently circumvent the establishment of chronic diseases. Besides its role in the early initiation and progression of diseases, such as cancer, inflammation similarly plays an important role in the resolution of diseases, such as myocardial infarction. Thereby, a balanced inflammatory response is decisive in order to

achieve proper healing instead of disease progression and aggravation.

While  ex  vivo  methodologies  such  as  histology, proteomics, metabolomics, and others provide snapshots of inflammation, molecular imaging provides a way to visualize, identify, and quantify inflammation in vivo and track biomarkers of inflammation dynamically over time [5, 6]. So far, various imaging techniques have been developed and clinically approved for in vivo imaging, such as positron emission tomography (PET), single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computerized tomography (CT), and ultrasound imaging. However, their disadvantages limit their utilities for molecular imaging. Ionizing radiation in case of radiography, CT, and nuclear imaging can cause tissue damage, which has especially to be considered in younger patients. Relatively poor tissue contrast resolution (radiography, CT, ultrasound, nuclear imaging), high cost (MRI, nuclear imaging), and long acquisition times with ensuing patient discomfort (MRI, PET) are further disadvantages. Optical imaging exhibits superior imaging advantages for early diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring without using ionizing radiation, being cheap and potentially applicable at the patients' bedside [7, 8]. With respect to inflammation, only nuclear imaging is able to target specific aspects of inflammation such as increased glucose metabolism of immune cells. Contrast-enhanced CT and MRI, besides morphologic imaging, can only depict indirect aspects of inflammation such as increased perfusion and altered endothelial permeability. Optical molecular imaging is a method of obtaining biological information by detecting specific molecules or elementary groups within cells or tissues using light/photons of various wavelengths and energies [8, 9]. The optical techniques have evolved rapidly and can be divided into optical coherence tomography (OCT), bioluminescence, fluorescence, optoacoustics, and Raman spectroscopy [10]. Besides, the development of targeted contrast agents promotes the sensitivity and specificity of optical imaging [11, 12]. Since inflammation is characterized by the presence of soluble factors (e.g., prostaglandins, cytokines), immune cells, increased vascularity, and potentially neoangiogenesis [2, 4, 13, 14], these characteristics can be used as biomarkers for in vivo optical imaging of immunity and inflammation.

In this review, we introduce major optical imaging techniques by means of imaging technologies and contrast agents (Table 1), highlighting the most recent in vivo optical imaging approaches used for the detection of inflammation and give an outlook about the development of current technologies.

## Optical imaging modalities

## OCT

The functional principle of OCT imaging is based on light interference, which is the core of any OCT setup [15]. Although different types of interference configurations have been constructed, the optical fiber-based Michelson setup still relies on the light interference. Briefly, the light generated by a low-coherence source is split into two beams by the coupler, where each beam travels separately within an arm of the interferometer (reference and sample arm). Then, the light backscattered from these two reunites at the coupler and subsequently produces an interference pattern, recorded by a single point detector.

OCT is used to visualize the internal microstructures in biological systems by measuring the magnitude of backscattered light and echo time delay [16]. OCT images have a resolution of 1 to 15 µm which reflects the optical backscattering in a cross-sectional plane through the tissue [17]. This also allows real-time imaging without tissue destruction, which broadens the use of OCT for numerous clinical applications including ophthalmology, dermatology, dentistry, and cardiology. Due to the micrometer resolution, it is possible to detect pathological changes at cellular resolution, making OCT an attractive imaging modality in the clinic [16].

OCT typically relies on the backscattering of nearinfrared (NIR) light from endogenous scatters (such as mitochondria and cell nuclei) to resolve tissue morphology [18]. To enable visualization of specific molecules and cells within biological tissues using OCT, functionalized plasmonic nanoparticles, such as gold nanorods or nanoprisms, have been developed as OCT contrast agents as they scatter enough light to counteract the endogenous tissue signal [19-21].

## Bioluminescence imaging

Bioluminescence imaging employs luciferase-based gene reporters to directly visualize molecular and cellular processes in living subjects [22, 23]. The luminescence is persistently produced due to a reaction between the luciferin substrate and luciferase enzyme. This avoids the excitation light's irradiation and offers longitudinal imaging in autofluorescence-free images in vivo [24]. Thereby, bioluminescence imaging exhibits a high signal to background ratio, high sensitivity, and high specificity for cellular and molecular processes. Besides, it is relatively easy to perform small animal imaging by bioluminescence, which requires three steps: (1) genetic engineering of bioluminescent reporter genes in animals, (2) injecting the luciferin

substrate to the animals, and (3) acquiring and processing the luminescence images [24, 25]. Today, this technique is restricted to preclinical use owing to the limited tissue attenuation of light, potential toxicity of luciferin, and the potential immunogenicity of luciferases [26].

Luciferases from sea pansy Renilla reniformis, North American firefly Photinus pyralis, marine copepod Gaussia princeps, and click beetle Pyrophorus plagiophthalamus are the most commonly used reporter proteins for bioluminescence imaging. Luciferases from marine organisms employ coelenterazine analogs as substrates; the luciferases from terrestrial organisms use firefly luciferin as substrate and ATP,   Mg 2+ , and   O 2 as co-factors [25]. Another method for the production of bioluminescence uses the ability of luminol to emit light (425 nm) when exposed to an oxidizing agent like hypochlorous acid (a product of myeloperoxidase activity within activated neutrophils) [27, 28]. In addition, to create brighter bioluminescence images, bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) are established to shift their emission to the NIR region [29].

## Fluorescence imaging

Fluorescence imaging is a high-sensitive image method that uses fluorescent agents as labels to visualize biological processes, such as molecular interactions in cells and tissues or the dynamics of gene or protein expression [8]. Because of the superior advantages (high spatial resolution, portability,

real-time display, and detailed molecular profiling), fluorescence imaging can be used for both preclinical and clinical applications. Fluorescence-guided surgery allows the precise detection of tumor cell accumulations and tumor margins in real-time during open or endoscopic surgical procedures. The commonly implemented strategy is to employ a light source with an appropriate wavelength to illuminate the tissue for fluorophores' excitation and detect the emitted fluorescence using a digital camera. Differently designed setups include epi-illumination fluorescence imaging, transillumination fluorescence imaging, and fluorescence molecular tomography (FMT) [30]. Epi-illumination and transillumination provide easily operated ways for in vivo imaging, but quantitative observations are limited owing to the inability to resolve depth [30]. FMT can use tomographic principles to attenuate this problem. It depicts the three-dimensional tomography of whole tissues by utilizing multiple photon sources and detectors [31].

NIR fluorescent agents are efficiently applied for visualizing in vivo molecular targets with reduced scattering in the NIR spectrum improving spatial resolution and signal quantification [32]. So far, various synthetic and formulation methods are used to develop fluorescence agents with NIR-I emission (700-950 nm) or NIR-II emission (1000-1700 nm) [33-36]. They mainly include inorganic agents and organic agents [35]. Inorganic agents are semiconductor quantum dots, rare-earth-based nanoparticles, silica dots, and gold nanoclusters. While inorganic agents have a good fluorescent quantum yield, the existence of metal might have some

concerns for in vivo studies due to due to low biocompatibility and long deposition times in the body after systemic administration [37]. Organic agents are small-molecule organic fluorophores such as cyanine, squaraine, BODIPY, porphyrin, aggregation-induced emission dots, or conjugated co-polymers, providing good biocompatibility and bioavailability [38].

## Optoacoustic imaging

Optoacoustic imaging is based on the optoacoustic effect, where the optoacoustic contrast agent absorbs the optical energy of a pulsed laser and converts it into thermal energy, which generates thermoelastic expansion, creating a subsequent ultrasonic signal. It combines the advantages of traditional optical imaging and ultrasound imaging with improved contrast and spatiotemporal resolution compared to fluorescence imaging [39-41]. Due to the advantageous features of high-resolution and an imaging depth of several centimeters, it can effectively investigate the structure, function, and molecular characteristics of biological systems in health and disease including metabolism [42]. Optoacoustic imaging has great potential for clinical translation, and the technology has already been evaluated in humans for breast imaging, dermatologic imaging, vascular imaging, musculoskeletal imaging, gastrointestinal imaging, and adipose tissue imaging [42]. Because of an inherently scalable method, optoacoustic imaging allows visualization at the microscopic (micrometer range), mesoscopic (1-5-mm range), and macroscopic scale (beyond 5 mm), achieving an acoustic readout with a resolution ranging from tens to a few hundred microns, which cannot be achieved using an optical readout [43-48]. On the microscopic scale, optoacoustic microscopy utilizes focused laser beams to illuminate the target tissue, which can achieve submicron resolution, with a few hundred microns of penetration depth [46]. Optoacoustic microscopy thereby enables to study immune cells, microvasculature, and cell-tissue interaction in vivo in superficial tissues. On the mesoscopic scale, optoacoustic imaging uses ultrasound detectors (10-100 MHz) to visualize the tissues with ~30-100 mm lateral resolution and a few millimeters of penetration [46]. On the macroscopic scale, optoacoustic tomography systems employ 5 MHz ultrasound detectors to image the tissues with ~100-400 mm resolution and several centimeters of depths [46-48].

Biological tissues contain various endogenous NIRabsorbing chromophores, such as hemoglobin, lipids, and melanin, which can be used for label-free structural, functional, and molecular optoacoustic imaging [49, 50]. However, to enable significantly richer profiling of biological activities, exogenous contrast agents have been developed for enhancing the image contrast. The ideal optoacoustic

contrast agent should have a high molar absorption coefficient, a sharp NIR absorption spectrum, high photostability, and efficient conversion of heat energy [51]. So far, various optoacoustic agents have been reported, mainly including metal nanocrystals (e.g., gold nanoparticles, palladium nanoplates), carbon-based agents (e.g., carbon nanotubes, graphenes), 2D graphene analogs (e.g., CuS, WS2,    MoS ,  FeS,    Bi 2 2 S3 ),  organic  dyes  (e.g.,  cyanine, BODIPY, porphyrin, squaranine, croconaine), and organic dye-derived nanoparticles, and semiconducting polymer nanoparticles [40, 52-55].

## Raman spectroscopy

Raman spectroscopy is an optical technique that utilizes inelastic scattering of photons from vibrating molecules. This effect can be used to visualize the chemical composition of cells and tissues [56]. The generated Raman spectrum (2000-400   cm -1 ) is depending on the scattering of light due to the excitation of molecules by laser light and the resulting vibrations. The emitted photons have various wavelengths corresponding to the spectral molecular fingerprint of the excited biological sample [57]. Besides, the produced spectra enable to quantify the biochemical changes of samples at spatial resolutions down to 1 μM [58]. Due to the high chemical specificity, minimal sample preparation, and sensitive detection of Raman spectra, it has evolved as a preclinical and clinical diagnostic tool for inflammation and cancer, such as ulcerative colitis or breast cancer [56, 59].

Owing to the relatively  low  efficiency  of  inelastic light scattering, the updated Raman technology promotes in vivo applications, such as non-linear Raman scattering, termed stimulated Raman scattering (SRS), and coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) [60]. Meanwhile, surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), which utilizes plasmonic effects to enhance the strong electromagnetic field from the surface of metallic nanoparticles, has developed leading to enhanced Raman signals [61, 62]. Various metallic nanoparticles, especially made from gold and silver, have been commonly synthesized to couple with different frequencies of light [61]. To actively target inflammatory areas, nanoparticles are frequently functionalized using peptides or antibodies together with a reporter dye, which can be used to measure and quantify the signal intensities in a multiplexed way [61].

## In vivo optical imaging of inflammatory disease

## OCT imaging of inflammation

Kim  et  al.  employed  conventional  OCT  to  image  the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced skin inflammation on the

mouse ear [79]. Structural and angiography OCT images showed that tissue swelling and vasodilation can persist for over an hour. Lam et al. applied OCT imaging of preinvasive bronchial lesions by inserting a bronchoscope-fiberoptic probe into the airways of 138 volunteers [80]. Quantitative measurements of the epithelium in OCT images from different histologic grades showed a progressive increase in the thickness owing to a multilayer structure and larger nuclei as the epithelium changes. Wang et al. utilized an OCT angiography (OCTA) system with 1310-nm wavelength to measure the microvascular and structural features of different skin conditions [81]. As an example, Fig. 1a, b show the enface vascular images and B-scans of healthy nail fold and of systemic sclerosis, which indicates the vascular abnormalities and structural deformation in systemic sclerosis [81]. Thus, OCTA technology paves a new way for visualizing the blood flow and structural features of inflamed skin. OCT is also applicable for understanding the pathological changes of neurosensory retina in uveitis which provides an accurate depiction of the microvasculature morphology of the retinal and choroidal blood vessels [66, 67]. For example, Behcet uveitis can be detected with OCT as occlusive vasculitis in the retina is a primary target of the disease. One study showed the wedge-shaped defects in the peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) from OCT images, which indicates an acute focal damage to the ganglion cell layer and the RNFL (Fig. 1c-e) [69]. To achieve intravascular imaging with OCT, Costa et al. employed a 0.019-inch OCT wire for OCT imaging of the mouse aorta and direct visualization of the atherosclerosis plaque in an atherosclerosis model revealing an excellent correlation to standard histology [82]. Additionally, endoscopic OCT enables two-/three-dimensional imaging of

long swaths of internal luminal organs [83, 84]. Shen et al. used endoscopic OCT for diagnosing inflammatory bowel disease with 90% of sensitivity and 83.3% of specificity [69]. Similar results were also confirmed in ulcerative colitis [70].

## Bioluminescence imaging of inflammation

Owing to the high expression of myeloperoxidase (MPO) in neutrophils, monocytes, and macrophages during the inflammatory process, accurately assessing the MPO activity in vivo can help to monitor the inflammatory activity of myeloid cells [85]. Luminol is an efficient luciferin substrate to identify MPO in vivo [86]. Gross et al. present bioluminescence imaging of MPO in phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-induced dermatitis and lipopolysaccharide-induced acute arthritis after the administration of luminol to   MPO +/+ and   MPO -/-mice [28]. The bioluminescence signal was locally emitted from PMA-treated earlobes and LPS-treated joints of   MPO +/+ mice. However, the blue emission of luminol ( λ max = 425 nm) only allowed detection of superficial inflammatory foci due to the limited penetration depth of short wavelengths. Thus, some groups integrated BRET and FRET to red-shift luminol-emitted blue light to NIR light, enabling MPO-dependent inflammation imaging in deeper tissues. Liu et al. constructed the BRET-FRET system by loading two tandem dyes (DiI and DiD) into nanobubbles. Then the mixture (nanobubbles and luminol) was administered to the LPS-induced mice [87]. The luminescence signal from this group was much stronger than in the control groups (Fig. 2a, b). Xu et al. designed self-illuminating nanoparticles by combining luminol, a fluorescent acceptor (chlorin e6 (Ce6)), and an amphiphilic polymer (PEG) [88]. Under

oxidative conditions and in the presence of MPO, fluorescent signals led to the direct detection of inflamed sites. The authors evaluated their nanoparticles in different mouse models (peritonitis, acute liver injury, colitis) and showed that all particle-treated groups exhibited a much stronger signal at the inflamed site than the saline and luminol treated groups (Fig. 2c). Besides, several groups engineered molecular probes that produce firefly luciferin in situ upon metabolic changes (such as hydrogen peroxide release, caspase activity, hydrogen polysulfide release). Van de Bittner et al. presented such a method for dual-analyte detection in a murine model of acute inflammation [89]. Additionally, with help of bioluminescence imaging, macrophages tagged with two reporter genes (firefly luciferase and human sodium iodide symporter) were used to track macrophage migration in turpentine oilinduced inflammatory foci [23, 90, 91].

## Fluorescence imaging of inflammation

So far, fluorescence imaging of inflammation is based on detecting NIR-I and NIR-II emission with NIR-I-emitting agents being the most common ones [35]. So far, indocyanine

green (ICG) is the only FDA-approved NIR dye for clinical use. Vinegoni et al. reported that ICG enables to target inflamed atheroma and offers strong fluorescent signals for in vivo diagnosis of atheromatous plaques in atheromabearing rabbits [92]. Furthermore, Bhatnagar et al. reported the detection of NIR dye IRDye800CW in inflamed joints of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mouse model compared with healthy ones [93]. Zhou et al. developed a hypoxiaactivatable and cytoplasmic protein-powered fluorescence cascade amplifier (HCFA) for in vivo fluorescence imaging of hypoxia in an inflammatory bowel disease model [94]. In a hypoxic environment, the nanoparticles could be cleaved, and the fluorescence amplifier is getting activated which was detectable by whole-body fluorescent imaging. Besides, various immune cells labeled with fluorophore can be used to monitor the inflammatory diseases [95]. For example, Lee et al. employed fluorescent magnetic nanoparticles labeled primary macrophages to monitor the macrophage migration toward acute inflammatory lesions by both NIR fluorescence and MR imaging [96, 97]. However, these epi-illumination images have some limitations in regard to depth and visualization of the 3D structure. With the development of hybrid

FMT and X-ray computed tomography (XCT), in-depth imaging was made possible [98]. Ma et al. demonstrated the detection of inflammation in a preclinical asthma model due to the special feature to merge anatomical and fluorescencebased biological contrast (Fig. 3a) [99]. In addition, Glinzer et al. employed FMT-XCT to assess neutrophil elastase activity in a murine atherosclerosis model (Fig. 3b) [100]. Using a neutrophil elastase-specific fluorescent agent, inflamed atherosclerotic plaques in the aortic root and arch were detectable.

However, traditional fluorescent probes with 700-950 nm emission are facing some problems for in vivo applications due to undesired photon scattering and autofluorescence from tissue. This obstacle can be overcome by using NIR-II fluorescence imaging which is able to explore deep-tissue information in the range of centimeter and to obtain micron-level resolution at the millimeter depth [101]. Liu et al. demonstrated NIR-II optical imaging in a mouse model of LPS-induced inflammation in the brain using aggregation-induced emission (AIE) luminogens

(2TTo C6B) (Fig. 3c, d) [102]. The PEGylated AIEs were able to penetrate neutrophils which can pass the bloodbrain-barrier and being retained at the inflammation site. Furthermore, Zhao et al. introduced an in vivo crosslinking strategy using glutathione-modified NIR-II lanthanide nanoparticles [103]. Due to the ROS-responsive cross-linking property, the ROS generation at the inflamed region can be visualized in real-time by means of NIR-II fluorescence. Wang et al. reported NIR-II emissive ratiometric nanomicelles that respond to HOCl used for sensing lymphatic inflammation. The system was based on a competitioninduced emission mechanism between Cy7.5 fluorophores and lanthanide nanoparticles [104]. With these nanoprobes, the authors were able to detect inflamed lymphatic vessels and lymph nodes in mice following intradermal LPS administration.

Currently, various clinical trials have been initiated to evaluate optical imaging for fluorescence-guided surgery and endoscopy [71, 105, 106].

## Optoacoustic imaging of inflammation

Compared to the previously mentioned imaging techniques, optoacoustic imaging enables improved quantification of biological processes at increased spatial resolution. A range of specific absorbers has been applied in preclinical and clinical research, including endogenous hemoglobin and exogenously synthesized contrast agents.

Deoxy-hemoglobin (Hb) and oxy-hemoglobin   (HbO 2 ) have relative optical absorption contrast in the visible to NIR region, which are conductive to label-free optoacoustic imaging of inflammatory-based diseases [107]. Bhutiani et al. used multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) to detect Hb and   HbO  intensity of colitis in mice [108]. 2 The   HbO  signal increased significantly during progressive 2 bowel inflammation, validated by colonoscopy and histology. Meanwhile, Waldner et al. employed a handheld MSOT system (3-4 MHz, 256 transducer elements, 700-, 730-, 760-, 800-, 850-, 900-nm excitation wavelength) to examine the intestinal wall of patients suffering from Crohn's disease [109]. They found increased   HbO  values and oxygen 2 saturation   (sO 2 ) in patients compared to healthy volunteers. This functional information correlated well with the level of disease activity.

Concerning optical imaging of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), the group of Xueding Wang utilized hemoglobin for noninvasive optoacoustic detection of joint inflammation [110]. They applied optoacoustic tomography with 1064-nm and 532-nm wavelengths to image RA-affected rats. Compared to the non-induced control animals, inflammatory arthritis showed an increased optoacoustic signal for blood hemoglobin. Ding et al. employed the optoacoustic technology to explore the effect of acupoint sensitization on structural changes in microcirculation in knees in an osteoarthritis mouse model [111]. In the next step, the group of Wang moved toward the clinic and examined RA patients using a novel point-of-care optoacoustic-ultrasound dual-imaging system [112]. By applying optoacoustic imaging with multiple wavelength settings, they found increased hyperemia and increased hypoxia in the synovia of arthritic patients compared to uninflamed joints. In another study, van den Berg et al. also showed the feasibility of a portable optoacoustic imaging system for the detection of synovitis [113]. Their handheld setup does not require the application of a contrast agent and is suitable for outpatient clinics. For the detection of inflammation-related skin diseases like psoriasis, Aguirre et al. employed raster-scan optoacoustic mesoscopy (RSOM) with ultrabroadband (10-180 MHz) for visualizing the skin morphology and vascular features of psoriatic skin, which achieved quantitative measures of inflammation without applying exogenous contrast agents [77]. In contrast to healthy skin, psoriatic skin showed thicker epidermis, elongated capillary collar closed to the skin surface, loss of

melanin, and increased dermal vascularization which was confirmed by histological staining (Fig. 4a). This technology provides quantitative metrics and structural information about inflammation-induced changes within the skin during inflammation.

However, to enhance the image contrast of inflamed regions, various exogenous contrast agents are developed to target specific aspects of inflammation. Beziere et al. reported polyglycerolsulfate (dPGS)-labeled ICG for optoacoustic imaging of RA using MSOT [114]. dPGS has a high affinity to adhesion molecules which are increasingly expressed during inflammation, which can enhance the optoacoustic signal from RA compared to healthy joints. Wu et al. designed an ICG@PEGAg2S nanoprobe for optoacoustic imaging of atherosclerosis. Due to the lipophilicity of the PEG chain, ICG@PEGAg2S feature prolonged blood retention and preferably accumulated within atherosclerotic plaques [115]. Lu et al. constructed a bovine serum albumin-manganese dioxide-ubiquicidin 29-41 -ICG-gentamicin (BMUIG) agent which combines high-resolution optoacoustic imaging with antibiotic properties as a theranostic agent in osteomyelitis [116]. As the manganese within the particles reacts with the hydrogen peroxide in the inflammatory regions, oxygen is produced, which in turn enhanced photodynamic therapy and optoacoustic readout. Ge et al. reported an osteopontin antibody (OPN Ab) together with ICG modified   Ti C 3 2 nanosheets (OPN Ab/Ti 3 C2/ICG) for enhanced optoacoustic imaging of vulnerable atherosclerotic plaques [117].   Ti C 3 2 nanosheets with large surface areas can load many ICG molecules to evidently improve the optoacoustic signal. Meanwhile, OPN Ab conjugation to the nanosheets specifically targeted the atherosclerotic plaques due to the high expression of OPN in foam cells within the plaque. The optoacoustic images exhibited a clear signal specifically in vulnerable plaques along the aortic arch.

NIR-II absorbing agents for optoacoustic imaging can enable deeper tissue penetration and a higher signal-tonoise ratio than NIR-I agents. Ye et al. developed Ag shell coated Pd-tipped gold nanorods (Au-Pd@Ag NR) with a H2O2-responsive feature [118]. The existence of   H O  can 2 2 etch and oxidize the Ag shell to become Ag ions, which not only kill bacteria effectively but also induce an absorption shift from 700 to 1260 nm. The ratiometric optoacoustic imaging at 1260 and 700 nm accurately quantifies   H O  in 2 2 models of bacterial infection, abdominal inflammation, and osteoarthritis. Chen et al. reported tocilizumab conjugated polymer nanoparticles (TCZ-PNPs) for the imaging-guided therapy of RA using NIR-II optoacoustic imaging [119]. TCZ-PNPs not only enable active targeting of RA to specify NIR-II optoacoustic signaling but also significantly inhibited the progression of RA. Importantly, the powerful NIR-II optoacoustic imaging evidently visualized the therapeutic effect of tocilizumab and the reduction of inflammation

within the paws (Fig. 4b, c). Xie et al. constructed anti-CD36 labeled semiconducting polymer NPs (PBD-CD36 NPs) for in vivo optoacoustic imaging of inflammatory components in carotid atherosclerotic regions in a mouse model [120]. The administration of PBD-CD36 NPs led to the optoacoustic identification of atherosclerotic plaques after 24 h, confirmed by immunohistochemistry (Fig. 4d, e).

## Raman spectroscopy of inflammation

Raman spectroscopy using an integrated Raman probe mounted at the top of an endoscopic catheter allowed for the detection of colitis in the clinical setting [59]. Tefas et al. summarized the publications in which Raman spectroscopy was used for the detection of colitis [87]. The diagnostic specificity and sensitivity in inflammatory bowel diseases ranged from 57 to 99% and 82 to 99% respectively. Impressively, accuracies up to 95% were reported, highlighting the practicability of this technique as an effective tool for the  diagnosis  of  colitis  and  Crohn's  disease.  As  SERS allows noninvasive imaging with sufficient depth, two studies showed its further applicability for in vivo imaging of

vascular inflammation. For the first time, McQueenie et al. reported anti-ICAM-1 conjugated gold nanoparticles as an endothelial-specific probe for SERS measurements in mice [121]. Due to the altered expression of ICAM-1 during early inflammation, the nanoparticles specifically targeted regions with increased leukocyte adhesion molecule expression, which can be detected by SERS with the corresponding Raman spectra. In addition, Noonan et al. employed multiple antibody-labeled gold nanoparticles for multiplex imaging of VCAM-1, ICAM-1, and P-selectin in a human adipose engraftment mouse model [122]. After i.v. injection of receptor-targeted and non-targeted gold nanoparticles in two groups, in mice of the targeted group, all the 3 reporter molecules were detected while in the non-targeted group no signal was observed (Fig. 5).

## Labeling and tracking of immune cells

Besides in vivo imaging of inflammation, optical and optoacoustic reporters can be used to label immune cells with subsequent tracking in living organisms. Fluorescent lipophilic dyes such as DiR can be incorporated into the lipid

double-layer of the cell membrane for labeling purposes [123]. Similarly, fluorescent dyes can be coupled to a variety of nanoparticles which are incorporated into cells via phagocytosis. Especially myeloid cells such as monocytes and macrophages, but also neutrophils, allow high labeling efficiencies with subsequent high contrast-to-noise ratios [124]. Labeling thereby can occur ex vivo with subsequent injection of the labeled cells into the circulation; similarly, fluorescent nanoparticles, nanorods, nanoprisms, and others can be injected into the animal with subsequent uptake by phagocytes in the circulation in vivo.

Nanoparticles are especially favored as they allow multimodality imaging by combining optical, magnetic resonance, and radionuclide properties [125, 126]. Labeled immune cells can be tracked dynamically over multiple days, accumulating more or less specifically at sites of acute and chronic inflammation, such as in atherosclerosis [127].

Label-free detection of immune cells has been shown to be possible using Raman spectroscopy. Besides, Raman spectroscopy  can  identify  the  purified,  unfixed,  and untouched populations of major immune cell (T lymphocyte subsets, B cells, natural killer cells) subsets from healthy human donors, although these works only limit to in vitro identification [128-130].

Besides labeling cells, also cell derivatives such as extracellular vesicles can be labeled by lipophilic optical imaging agents and subsequently be tracked in vivo. Gerwing et al. used DiR-labeled tumor-derived extracellular vesicles to investigate target sites of metastasis [131]. Here, inflammation

has been shown to be present in the premetastatic niche, before the actual seeding of cancer cells [132].

## Conclusions and perspectives

Optical techniques have unparalleled advantages for highsensitive imaging of inflammation as morphology, function, and molecular information can be captured in vivo. Moreover, combining optical techniques with ultrasound readout in optoacoustics, imaging of inflammation can be performed at multiple scales. Optical imaging in deeper tissue will always be limited by an impaired penetration depth. This limitation is currently being improved by shifting fluorescence to higher wavelengths within the NIR-II window, which can be applied both in fluorescence and optoacoustic imaging techniques. The future of in vivo optical imaging of inflammation will inevitably focus on the optimization of NIR-II devices and the development of targeted NIR-II probes. While this will initially be confined to the preclinical setting, deeper penetration depths and increased spatial resolution will foster translation of these techniques toward the clinics, applying optical techniques for fluorescence-guided surgery, endoscopy, and intravascular imaging in order to target inflammation as a central pathomechanism in multiple diseases.
