Intestinal ischemia/reperfusion is a prevalent pathological process that can result in  intestinal  dysfunction,  bacterial  translocation,  energy  metabolism  disturbances, and subsequent harm to distal tissues and organs via the circulatory system. Acute  lung  injury  frequently  arises  as  a  complication  of  intestinal  ischemia/ reperfusion, exhibiting early onset and a grim prognosis. Without appropriate preventative measures and efficacious interventions, this condition may progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome and elevate mortality rates. Nonetheless, the precise mechanisms and efficacious treatments remain elusive. This paper synthesizes  recent  research  models  and  pertinent  injury  evaluation  criteria within the realm of acute lung injury induced by intestinal ischemia/reperfusion. The objective is to investigate the roles of pathophysiological mechanisms like oxidative stress, inflammatory response, apoptosis, ferroptosis, and pyroptosis; and to assess the strengths and limitations of current therapeutic approaches for acute lung injury stemming from intestinal ischemia/reperfusion. The goal is to elucidate potential targets for enhancing recovery rates, identify suitable treatment  modalities,  and  offer  insights  for  translating  fundamental  research into clinical applications.

## 1 Introduction

Intestinal ischemia/reperfusion (II/R) commonly occurs in the context of severe shock, infection,  traumatic  injury,  mesenteric  artery  embolism,  intestinal  volvulus,  intestinal obstruction,  small  bowel  transplantation,  liver  transplantation,  cardiopulmonary  bypass surgery, and abdominal aortic aneurysm surgery. The associated morbidity and mortality remain significant (1). This is closely linked to the anatomical structure of the intestine and the body's prioritization of ensuring blood supply to vital organs such as the heart and brain during acute ischemic stress (2). Following the relief of the cause of intestinal ischemia through surgery or other means, although the intestinal tissue can restore blood perfusion, the body undergoes a series of pathophysiological changes during II/R. These changes include ischemic injury due to hypoxia and lack of essential energy substances, resulting in damage to the intestinal tissue and increased vascular permeability. Subsequent reperfusion injury leads to metabolic disorders, activation of inflammatory signaling pathways and oxidative stress pathways, intracellular

calcium overload, mitochondrial damage, and cell death (3). Oxygen and nitrogen free radicals, as well as inflammatory factors produced during II/R, are released into the blood, rapidly activating immune cells and triggering systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) (4). Additionally,  the integrity of the intestinal mucosal  barrier  is compromised,  allowing  intestinal  bacteria,  endotoxin,  and  other substances to enter the circulatory system, causing distal tissue and organ damage, and potentially leading to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) (5), posing a threat to patients' lives.

Among the various distal organs, the lung, being the sole recipient of all cardiac output, is highly sensitive to II/R and is particularly vulnerable. It exhibits early and severe characteristics of injury (6). Pathological manifestations of lung injury include alveolar epithelial and pulmonary capillary endothelial destruction, alveolar edema, neutrophil infiltration, and  hyaline membrane  formation  (7), involving various interrelated pathophysiological mechanisms such as inflammatory response, oxidative stress, apoptosis, autophagy, and ferroptosis.  Figure  1  summarizes  the  main  processes  and  related mechanisms of acute lung injury induced by intestinal  ischemia/ reperfusion (Figure 1). Failure to adequately manage patients with acute lung injury caused by intestinal ischemia/reperfusion may lead to disease progression  and  subsequent  development  of  acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), characterized by a significantly high mortality rate of approximately 40% (8). However, the underlying mechanism of II/R-induced ALI (II/R-ALI) and effective methods to alleviate lung injury after II/R are not well-defined.

This article seeks to examine the animal models utilized in recent preclinical investigations of II/R-ALI, focusing on diagnostic criteria for acute lung injury, signal transduction pathways, injury-associated cytokines, treatment modalities, and existing challenges within this domain. The objective is to elucidate potential pathogenic mechanisms, identify relevant biomarkers, investigate novel targeted therapeutic approaches,  and  offer  insights  for  both  fundamental  research  and clinical translation.

## 2 Animal models and indicators for lung injury assessment

## 2.1 Animal models

Numerous studies on II/R-ALI lack standardized animal models and diagnostic criteria for lung injury. Researchers have employed various animal species to establish II/R models in order to fulfil the requirements for detecting corresponding indicators. For example, Li et al. (9) utilized C57BL/6J mice, Chen et al. (10) employed SpragueDawley rats, Bian et al. (11) utilized pigs, and Anderson et al. (12) utilized horses. Moreover, the timing of sample collection for intestinal tissue  ischemia  and  reperfusion  varies.  The  duration  of  intestinal ischemia induced by clamping the superior mesenteric artery ranged from 30 min to 2 h. The shortest duration for removing the artery clip to  restore  blood  perfusion  of  the  superior  mesenteric  artery  was 60 min, while the longest was seven days.

## 2.2 Assessment of lung injury

In animal studies, the assessment of II/R-ALI primarily encompasses the following dimensions. Physiological impairment,

such as reduced arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO ) in blood gas 2 analysis; diminished lung compliance: decreased static compliance of lung tissue, elevated airway resistance; heightened permeability of the alveolar capillary membrane: increased total protein concentration in alveolar lavage fluid, augmented extravasation of FITC fluorescent dye, elevated extravascular lung water content, and increased wet/dry weight ratio of lung tissue; escalated pathological damage score of lung tissue: accumulation of neutrophils in alveoli or pulmonary interstitium; formation of hyaline membrane, presence of protein fragments  in  the  alveolar  space,  thickening  of  alveolar  walls; inflammatory response in lung tissue: increased absolute number of neutrophils in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, heightened activity of myeloperoxidase (MPO) in lung tissue, and increased concentrations of  pro-inflammatory  cytokines  (IL-1 β , TNF- ,  IL-6,  IL-18)  and α chemokines (CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL8) in lung tissue or bronchoalveolar  lavage  fluid  (13);  exacerbated  oxidative  stress: elevated  concentrations  of  malondialdehyde  (MDA)  and  reactive oxygen  species  (ROS)  in  lung  tissue  and  blood,  and  decreased concentration of glutathione (GSH) and superoxide dismutase (SOD); apoptosis of lung tissue: increased number of TUNEL-positive cells in lung tissue, decreased ratio of Bcl-2/Bax, and increased expression of pro-apoptotic factors caspase-3, caspase-8, and caspase-9. Table 1 summarized recent animal models of II/R-induced lung injury and associated assessment indicators (Table 1).

## 3 The mechanism of intestinal ischemia/reperfusion-induced acute lung injury

## 3.1 Oxidative stress

Oxidative  stress  is  a  pathological  process  characterized  by excessive production of oxidizing substances and an imbalance in the body's antioxidant defence system. This leads to the infiltration of inflammatory  cells, increased secretion of proteases, and  the generation  of  a  large  number  of  intermediate  products,  such  as reactive oxygen species and active nitrogen, which the body is unable to neutralize. This process has detrimental effects on the body and is considered a crucial factor in ageing and disease (31). The classical mechanism of oxidative stress is crucial in II/R-ALI.

## 3.1.1 Production of reactive oxygen species

ROS, primarily produced by mitochondria, are the metabolites of oxygen molecules and the highly reactive chemicals derived from them.  They  are  direct  participants  and  important  biomarkers  of oxidative stress (32). Under normal physiological conditions, cells produce a small amount of ROS as part of physiological processes such as pathogen inactivation, wound healing, and tissue repair (33). During intestinal ischemia, tissue cell metabolism slows down or stops, leading to the inability of mitochondrial metabolism to recover coenzymes (NADH, H + , and FADH2). Upon reperfusion, the release of  a  large  number  of  electrons  from  the  coenzymes  exceeds  the transfer capacity of the respiratory chain, producing a large amount of ROS. Additionally, the change in respiratory chain compounds caused by ROS exacerbates mitochondrial dysfunction and disrupts mitochondrial ROS production. Furthermore, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase uses NADPH and H + as substrates  to  catalyze  the  reduction  of  O   to  ROS  (34).  Calcium 2

overload and reduced ATP synthesis lead to the activation of xanthine oxidase  (XO)  and  the  production  of  ROS.  Nitric  oxide  synthase (NOS) exists as a homodimer under physiological conditions, while it exists as a monomer that contributes to the production of ROS during  II/R,  which  is  involved  in  producing  ROS  (35).  A  large amount of ROS produced by the body through the above pathways enters  the  blood  circulation,  accelerating  ischemia/reperfusion injury.  The  excessive  production  of  ROS  overwhelms  the  body's processing  capacity of antioxidant substances, such  as SOD, glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and catalase (CAT), triggering systemic oxidative stress and tissue damage (36).

## 3.1.2 Oxidative stress-induced lung injury

Studies  have  confirmed  that  oxidative  stress  can  reduce  the oligomerization of tight junctions (TJs) in the alveolar barrier, recruit

neutrophils to cross the alveolar barrier, secrete cytotoxic substances, and increase pulmonary capillary permeability (37). Increased ROS production also leads to the decomposition of TJs in lung tissue, up-regulation  of  pro-inflammatory  cytokines  and  chemokines, amplifying tissue damage and pulmonary edema, and accelerating the destruction of the alveolar barrier (38). In a model of II/R, the content of  MDA  in  lung  tissue  increased.  At  the  same  time,  the  total antioxidant capacity (TAC) decreased, and the expression of inducible nitric  oxide  synthase  (iNOS)  and  its  product  NOx  in  lung  tissue increased by 5.5 times and 2.1 times, respectively. The total score of pathological injury of lung tissue was also increased significantly. This led to robust inflammatory reactions, alveolar edema, hemorrhage, and alveolar emphysema. However, treatment with the antioxidant cilostazol restored the balance between MDA and TAC, significantly alleviating  lung  injury.  Furthermore,  enhancing  NADPH  oxidase

activity and mast cell activation were found to be related to II/RALI. Inhibition of mast cell degranulation can protect lung endothelial cells from oxidative stress and improve lung function (39).

## 3.1.3 Oxidative stress-related signaling pathways

Studies have indicated that the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway is closely  associated  with  oxidative  stress,  and  its  activation  can effectively inhibit oxidative stress-induced apoptosis (40). PTEN, a negative regulator of the PI3K/Akt pathway, is enhanced in ischemia/ reperfusion injury, leading to reduced Nrf2 activity, oxidative stress, and impaired intestinal and lung functions (41). Research has shown that bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell derived-exosomes (BMSCexos) significantly regulate the PTEN/AKT/Nrf2 signaling pathway, reducing  apoptosis  and  oxidative  stress  and  improving  intestinal injury (42). Additionally, miR-144-3p, which can inhibit the synthesis of  target  gene  proteins,  was  found  to  target  PTEN  expression. Regulating  BMSC-exos  on  the  PTEN/AKT/Nrf2  pathway  and oxidative  stress  is  achieved  by  regulating  miR-144-3p,  providing

evidence for the potential application of BMSC-exos in the treatment of ischemia/reperfusion injury (43).

## 3.2 Inflammatory response

As  a  crucial  digestive  organ,  the  intestine  harbors  a  diverse microbial flora. During II/R, the release of intestinal flora into the bloodstream triggers SIRS (44). The activation of the NFκ B signaling pathway, Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling pathway, and NOD-like receptor  protein  3  (NLRP3)  inflammasome  are  identified  as  the primary cause of ALI in this context.

## 3.2.1 NFκ B signaling pathway

NF- B is a rapid-acting nuclear transcription factor that governs κ essential cellular signal transduction pathways. Following I/R, the disruption  of  the  intestinal  mucosal  barrier  and  compromised immune  function  led  to  the  influx  of  bacteria,  endotoxins,

inflammatory mediators, and oxidative stress-related factors into the circulation.  These  substances  bind  to  cell  surface  receptors  and activate the I κ B kinase (IKK) complex through various adaptors and signal kinases. The activation of IKK complex phosphorylates I κ B , α an inhibitor of NFκ B, resulting in the release and translocation of NF- B dimer to the nucleus. This process regulates the transcription κ of target genes, leading to the production and release of inflammatory mediators (45). Previous research has demonstrated that  the  activation  of  the  NFκ B signaling pathway significantly upregulates the expression of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6,  and  TNFα in  lung  tissue.  This  activation  also  increases neutrophil infiltration in lung tissue. It reduces the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), resulting in lung tissue congestion, edema, and widespread infiltration of inflammatory cells  in  the  alveoli  and  interstitial  lung  tissue.  Additionally,  it damages  the  integrity  of  the  alveolar  barrier  (46).  TNFα , in particular,  not  only  directly  causes  lung  tissue  damage  but  also forms a positive feedback loop with NFκ B, inducing endothelial cells to produce IL-1 β , IL-6, and other inflammatory factors, thereby triggering a cascade effect of inflammatory factors and exacerbating secondary lung injury (15). In animal experiments, overexpression of miR-146 reduced the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines by inhibiting  the  TNF  receptor-associated  factor  6  (TRAF6)/NF κ B signaling pathway, inhibited the apoptotic response in the intestine and lung tissues of mice with II/R-ALI, and protected mice from II/R-ALI (47).

## 3.2.2 TLR4 signaling pathway

Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are a class of type I transmembrane protein receptors that identify pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs)  on  microorganisms  and  damage-associated  molecular patterns (DAMPs) from host's damaged cells and are crucial for innate immunity (48). TLR4 is a pattern recognition receptor within the TLRs  family,  primarily  recognizing  exogenous  ligands  such  as lipopolysaccharide, as well as specific endogenous ligands including free fatty acids, heat shock proteins, and high mobility group protein B1  (HMGB1).  Upon  ligand  binding,  the  TLR4  receptor  domain interacts with cytoplasmic adaptor proteins (MyD88, TIRAP/MAL, and TRIF) to activate various signal transduction pathways, including extracellular  signal-regulated  kinase  (ERK),  c-Jun  NH2  terminal kinase (JNK), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and nuclear factor  kappa  B  (NFκ B)  pathways,  resulting  in  the  production  of pro-inflammatory  cytokines  and  chemokines  (49).  During  II/R, intestinal wall permeability decreases, leading to increased circulating blood  lipopolysaccharide  levels.  This  triggers  the  TLR4  signal transduction  pathway,  inducing  a  cascade  reaction  through  the myeloid  differentiation  factor  88-dependent  factor,  resulting  in excessive activation of the mononuclear macrophage system, immune response, cytokine storm, and ultimately ALI (50).

HMGB1, a primary DAMP released by necrotic intestinal cells following II/R, activates the TLR4/MyD88 signaling pathway, driving neutrophil  recruitment  to  lung  tissue.  Activated  neutrophils  can release  DNA and granular proteins, forming cytotoxic neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), which damage the alveolar barrier and exacerbate lung tissue injury. Blocking HMGB1 reverses these effects, protecting lung tissue from inflammation (6). In a porcine II/R model, propofol pretreatment decreased inflammatory factor and oxidative stress-related substance levels in lung tissue, improved II/R-induced

hypoxemia and acidemia, reduced airway resistance, and protected lung function by inhibiting the expression of the HMGB1/TLR4/PKR signaling  pathway  (11).  In  the  oxygen  and  glucose  deprivation/ reoxygenation  (OGD/R)  model  of  mouse  lung  epithelial  cells, silencing Nrf2 increased OGD/R-induced upregulation of TLR4 and MyD88, and exacerbated apoptosis and autophagy, revealing the role of the Nrf2/TLR4/MyD88 axis in inflammation-related lung injury (25). The TLR4/NFκ B signaling pathway is a classical mechanism triggering  an  inflammatory  response  in  the  ischemia/reperfusion model.  Activation  of  TLR4  can  promote  NFκ B  p65  activation, stimulate downstream inflammatory factor and chemokine production, and lead to ALI. BMSC-exos can inhibit TLR4/NFκ B signal  transduction,  control  the  inflammatory  response,  downregulate  the  critical  protease  caspase-3  in  the  apoptotic  cascade, reduce pulmonary microvascular epithelial cell apoptosis, and play a protective role in lung function (51).

## 3.2.3 NLRP3 inflammasome

NLRP3 is a receptor that contains NOD-, LRR-, and pyrin domain-containing  3.  It  has  the  ability  to  detect  damageassociated molecular patterns (DAMPs) from pathogens and the host, thereby initiating the formation of NLRP3 inflammasome complex (52). As a major participant in II/R-ALI, NLRP3 becomes activated following II/R and aggregates with ASC (the adaptor protein in the NLRP3  inflammasome),  which co-activate caspase-1 and promote the conversion of pro-IL-1 β and pro-IL-18 into IL-1 β and IL-18, causing acute inflammatory response and oxidative stress in lung tissue, leading to ALI (53). Furthermore, II/R  stimulation  can  induce  the  production  of  intestinal  lipid mediators, such as 12-HETE, 11-HETE, and 13-HODE, which have  regulatory  effects  on  both  innate  and  adaptive  immune responses.  These  mediators  enhance  the  activation  of  NLRP3 inflammasome and the production of IL-1 β in pulmonary vascular endothelial cells, contributing to ALI (54). It is now recognized that gut-derived lipid mediators hold the potential as regulators for treating and preventing II/R-related diseases. Over-activation of NLRP3 leads to the assembly of NLRP3 inflammasome complex and triggers pyroptosis through GSDMD-NT, resulting in plasma membrane rupture, production of inflammatory cytokines, and excessive release of LDH (55).

(17) observed increased expression levels of NLRP3 and NLRP3 inflammasome complex activation markers, such as caspase-1 and GSDMD, in in  vivo mouse II/R models and cell experiments of OGD-R, along with elevated LDH activity.

## 3.3 Apoptosis

Apoptosis is a regulated cell death process characterized by cell shrinkage, plasma membrane protrusions, chromosome condensation, and nuclear fragmentation (56). Under  normal  physiological conditions, apoptosis occurs spontaneously in intestinal epithelial cells (IEC),  maintaining  the  normal  morphology  and  function  of  the intestine and ensuring intestinal homeostasis (57). However, under certain pathological conditions, apoptosis is the predominant outcome of inflammatory response and oxidative stress (58).

In  the  context  of  the  II/R  model,  excessive  apoptosis  of  IEC following ischemic stress leads to increased intestinal permeability,

secondary bacterial translocation, and apoptosis of distal lung tissue through a series of complex pathophysiological reactions. The acute inflammatory response in lung tissue induced by II/R triggers the binding of the death receptor Fas to its ligand FasL in lung epithelial cells (59). Additionally, the tumor necrosis factor receptor-1 (TNFR1) binds to its ligands TNFα and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), initiating the mechanism of exogenous apoptosis. This leads to the recruitment of adaptor proteins, such as the Fas-associated death domain (FADD), to form a death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) that activates caspase-8 and its downstream apoptotic proteins. Simultaneously,  cytochrome  c  is  released  into  the  cytoplasm, triggering  the  activation  of  caspase-9-dependent  caspase-3  and initiating the downstream apoptotic cascade (60). Furthermore, the expression ratio of Bcl-2/Bax protein in lung tissue decreases (17), and the number of positive cells increases significantly, as indicated by TUNEL staining (16). Previous studies have demonstrated that in the II/R-ALI model, TNFα and reactive oxygen species (ROS) can initiate endogenous or exogenous apoptotic pathways, increase the formation of caspase-3 and promote cell death (61).

As a member of the Shc A family, p66Shc is expressed in most cells  except  hematopoietic  cell  lines  and  plays  a  crucial  role  in apoptosis by inducing DNA fragmentation, cytoskeleton degradation, and the formation of apoptotic bodies (62). Studies have shown that after II/R, protein kinase Cβ (PKCβ ) is activated explicitly in lung tissue (63), leading to a significant up-regulation of p66Shc expression and increased sensitivity of lung tissue to oxidative stress (64). The phosphorylation and activation of Ser36 of p66Shc by PKCβ result in its translocation to mitochondria, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and promoting apoptosis of lung tissue cells (65). The specific inhibitor of PKC- II,  LY333531,  has  been  found  to β significantly inhibit the activation of p66Shc, mitochondrial translocation, and binding to cytochrome c, thereby reducing II/Rinduced  acute  lung  tissue  injury,  inflammatory  cell  infiltration, oxidative  stress,  and  apoptosis  (66).  Additionally,  Feng  et  al.  (64) found that the upstream regulator of the p66Shc pathway, prolylisomerase Pin1, plays a similar role to PKCβ . II/R increased Pin1 protein expression and enzyme activity, promoting the translocation of p66Shc to mitochondria and accelerating apoptosis. Injection of the Pin1 inhibitor Juglone before II/R in rats effectively reduced secondary lung injury and improved the survival rate after II/R in rats. Functional analysis showed that p66Shc silencing significantly reduced OGD/Rinduced human colonic adenocarcinoma cell line Caco-2 damage, increased cell viability, reduced mitochondrial superoxide levels, and reduced TUNEL-positive cells and caspase-3 activation.

## 3.4 Ferroptosis

The concept of ferroptosis was initially introduced by Dixon et al. (67) in 2012 as a novel form of regulated cell death distinct from traditional cell death programs. Ferroptosis is characterized as an iron-dependent and caspase-independent non-apoptotic cell demise. The underlying mechanism involves iron catalyzing the generation of lipid free radicals and glutathione deficiency or inactivation of the lipid  repair  enzyme  GSH  peroxidase  4  (GPx4)  (68),  leading  to impairment of the intracellular antioxidant system. This is manifested by the accumulation of iron and lipid reactive oxygen species (L-ROS) in mitochondria, reduction or disappearance of mitochondrial cristae,

increased  mitochondrial  membrane  density,  and  rupture  of  the mitochondrial  outer  membrane,  ultimately  resulting  in  cellular dysfunction (69). Previous research has demonstrated that polyunsaturated fatty acids, oxygen, iron, and antioxidants are pivotal factors in inducing ferroptosis (70, 71). Current investigations have established a close association between ferroptosis and various human diseases,  including  cardiovascular  and  cerebrovascular  diseases, tumors, respiratory diseases, and ischemia/reperfusion injury (72).

Scholars have identified ferroptosis as a critical factor in II/R-ALI, and the inhibition of ferroptosis has been shown to have a protective effect against II/R-induced organ damage (9). In the II/R-ALI model, the levels of endogenous iron, ferrous iron, ferritin, and MDA in lung tissue were significantly elevated, while the level of reduced glutathione was markedly reduced (73). Transmission electron microscopy results revealed  characteristic  structural  changes  of  ferroptosis  in  the mitochondria of type II alveolar epithelial cells in II/R mice (74). Conversely, intervention with ferrostatin-1 in mice with II/R-ALI reduced lung tissue damage, improved lung epithelial cell viability, and restored epithelial barrier function (75). These findings indicate that ferroptosis is a crucial participant in II/R-ALI.

Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a critical transcription factor that responds to intracellular oxidative stress and is closely associated with ferroptosis. It becomes activated in high oxidative stress conditions, leading to the transcription of target genes and binding to the antioxidant response element (ARE) in the nucleus. This activation promotes the translation of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory proteins (76), regulates the ferroptosis pathway by controlling glutathione, iron, and  lipid metabolism,  and influences mitochondrial  function  (77),  ultimately  playing  a cytoprotective role. Studies have shown that Nrf2 activation in the nucleus can effectively prevent ALI (78). Additionally, the inhibitor of apoptosis-stimulating protein of p53 (iASPP) exerts p53-independent anti-ROS activity in the cytoplasm, promoting the accumulation and nuclear translocation of Nrf2, and increasing the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 α (Hif-1 α ).  This process reduces the content of transferrin (TF) and ferritin-related proteins FTH1, NQO-1, and HO-1, thereby protecting cells from ferroptosis by regulating the Nrf2-dependent Nrf2/HIF-1/TF signaling pathway (9). Furthermore, Nrf2 silencing has been observed to exacerbate ferroptosis  in  lung  epithelial  cells  and  reduce  the  expression  of telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) and SLC7A11. TERT has been reported to alleviate cell damage caused by ROS by going to mitochondria, while SLC7A11 is crucial in maintaining cell redox homeostasis (79, 80). The Nrf2/TERT/SLC7A11 axis has been shown to regulate ferroptosis, providing a potential new target for treating II/R-ALI  (19).  Additionally,  signal  transducer  and  activator  of transcription 3 (STAT3) has been found to be involved in ferroptosis after II/R, being phosphorylated by Nrf2 to pSTAT3 and regulating SLC7A11 expression alongside Nrf2 (73). Further research is needed to explore the interaction between Nrf2 and STAT3 in ferroptosis. Activation of Nrf2 has also been shown to up-regulate the expression of heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1), another ROS detoxification enzyme (81). HO-1 content increases compensation with Nrf2 in II/R or OGD/R models, exerting an anti-iron ion effect (74). However, some studies  have  indicated  that  HO-1,  in  addition  to  acting  as  an antioxidant enzyme to prevent ferroptosis caused by oxidative stress after  II/R,  can  induce  ferroptosis  under  hypoxic  conditions  by releasing  Fe 2+ through  its  upstream  regulator  Hif-1 α .  Therefore,

further  investigation  is  required  to  understand  the  dual  role  of HO-1 in II/R-induced ferroptosis in lung tissue cells (22).

## 3.5 Autophagy

Autophagy is a ubiquitous biological process found in eukaryotic cells. It involves the formation of autophagosomes, which are doublelayered membranes that encapsulate cytoplasmic proteins or organelles. These  autophagosomes  are  derived  from  the  rough  endoplasmic reticulum and subsequently fuse with lysosomes to form autolysosomes. Within  these  autolysosomes,  the  enclosed  contents  are  degraded, contributing to the regulation of homeostasis and immune response (82). Autophagy is considered a highly conserved cellular self-protection mechanism in evolution and is also recognized as a mechanism of cell death juxtaposed with apoptosis and necrosis (83). Its involvement in physiological  and  pathological  processes  makes  its  role  in  various diseases  intricate  and  contradictory.  In  the  context  of  II/R,  an inflammation-related illness, the relationship between autophagy and disease  progression  is  closely  intertwined  (84).  Researchers  have proposed differing perspectives on the role of autophagy in this context.

## 3.5.1 Moderate autophagy

One potential  mechanism  is  that  following  II/R,  the  body  can effectively eliminate ectopic flora resulting from changes in intestinal mucosal permeability by activating autophagy. This process helps to maintain intestinal microecological balance, protect lung function, and regulate homeostasis (85, 86). For instance, using transmission electron microscopy, Yan et al. (25) observed a significant increase in the number of autophagosomes in lung tissue cells after II/R. Western blot results also confirmed the up-regulation of autophagosome markers LC3 and Beclin-1  in  lung  tissue.  Further  investigation  into  the  mechanism revealed  that  Nrf2  could  regulate  the  expression  of  p62,  which  is recruited into autophagosomes to participate in the degradation of target  proteins  through  the  autophagy-lysosomal  pathway,  thereby contributing to lung protection. Several studies have indicated that II/R can lead to autophagy dysfunction (87). Jiang et al. (88) also found autophagy dysfunction and abnormal activation of intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) in the II/R model. By promoting the expression of autophagy-related genes Beclin-1 and Atg16 and activating the NOD2/Beclin-1 pathway, the autophagy of IELs can be enhanced, the  inflammatory  response  of  intestinal  mucosal  epithelium  can be reduced, and the energy balance and cell homeostasis of intestinal tissue during ischemia can be maintained, thereby improving ALI.

## 3.5.2 Excessive autophagy

Other researchers have suggested that abnormal and excessive autophagy of intestinal cells after intestinal ischemia can exacerbate intestinal mucosal barrier dysfunction and secondary lung injury (89). Previous studies have shown that II/R-ALI can generate significant complement C5a in lung tissue (90). Alveolar macrophages, as resident macrophages in lung tissue, exhibit up-regulated expression of their C5a receptor (C5aR) (91). Upon C5a binding to C5aR in alveolar macrophages, downstream signal transduction is initiated, promoting autophagy and activating macrophage autophagy. This eventually leads to apoptosis of alveolar macrophages and disrupts lung homeostasis. To investigate the specific mechanism, Hu et al. (92) established atg5deficient  mice  (Mf-ATG5/mice)  in  macrophages  to  inhibit  the

occurrence of macrophage autophagy. The results showed that the production of inflammatory cytokines in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of Mf-ATG5/mice was significantly reduced, the expression of autophagosome-related proteins was decreased, and lung injury was alleviated. It was confirmed that C5a interacted with C5aR to induce autophagy  and  subsequent  apoptosis  of  alveolar  macrophages  by promoting the degradation of Bcl-2 by Beclin-1, which aggravated ALI. Conversely, inhibition of autophagy can alleviate II/R-ALI.

Therefore, the role of autophagy in II/R-ALI remains controversial, and a critical threshold may exist between its protective and promoting effects, necessitating further research exploration.

## 3.6 Others

Other than the previously mentioned classic mechanisms of II/RALI, scholars have suggested that pyroptosis, formation of NETs, and alterations in intestinal flora and their metabolites may also play a role.

## 3.6.1 Pyroptosis

NLRP3-related pyroptosis has been shown to induce subsequent cell death by mediating the initial inflammatory response and plays an important role in various I/R injuries such as heart (93), liver (94), and kidney (95). Li et al. (17) found that in the intestine, like the above organs,  when  II/R  leads  to  severe  stress,  NLRP3  inflammasome activates  the  caspase-1  pathway  while  causing  an  inflammatory response, promoting the maturation of IL-1 β and GSDMD, and leads to pyroptosis of distal lung tissue cells. The same results were observed in  the  co-culture  model  of  IEC-6  and  MLE-12  cells  induced  by OGD/R.  In  the  rat  II/R  model  prepared  by  Yang  et  al.  (96), immunofluorescence  results  showed  that  the  expression  level  of pyroptosis marker GSDMD in lung tissue was significantly increased, and the application of inhibitors to block the formation of pyroptosis key factor NLRP3 complex can reverse the above phenomenon. It is suggested that pyroptosis is involved in the development of II/Rinduced intestinal and distal lung injury, and inhibiting the occurrence of pyroptosis through appropriate pathways can effectively prevent organ damage.

## 3.6.2 Neutrophil extracellular traps

Studies have found that after intestinal ischemia, HMGB1 released by  necrotic  intestinal  epithelial  cells  drives  lung  recruitment  and excessive  activation  of  neutrophils  through  the  MyD88  signaling pathway  to  undergo  morphological  changes,  nuclear  membrane rupture, the release of DNA and granular proteins into the cytoplasm, and finally plasma membrane rupture, leading to the formation of extracellular NETs, thereby aggravating ALI. Lung cell death and new NETs  formation  exacerbated  II/R-ALI  (97).  Zhan  et  al.  (6)  also confirmed that NETs degradation and HMGB1 pathway inhibition can be used as an effective targeted therapy strategy to reduce ALI caused by intestinal ischemia-reperfusion, and may be suitable for critically ill patients with acute intestinal ischemic diseases. However, some scholars have also proposed that appropriate NETs formation can prevent bacterial translocation caused by II/R, promote the repair of intestinal mucosal injury, and maintain the stability of intestinal epithelium (98). Therefore, like other immunomodulatory methods, it is particularly important to balance the advantages and disadvantages  of  NETs  formation  in  some  specific  cases.  Future

research should focus on the effects of NETs induction, inhibition, and degradation on pharmacological targets of diseases.

## 3.6.3 Intestinal flora and their metabolites

In recent years, the rapid development of microbial sequencing technology has provided a good platform for researchers to explore the mechanism of disease occurrence and development from a more microscopic perspective. Through sequencing technology, scholars have  found  that  II/R  inevitably  causes  changes  in  the  intestinal microenvironment  and  habitat  microorganisms.  This  ecological imbalance is characterized by the proliferation of Enterobacteriaceae bacteria and the reduction of beneficial symbiotic bacteria (such as Lactobacillus)  (99).  This  gut  microbiota  pattern  can  amplify  the damage to organs such as the intestine, kidney, and lungs caused by II/R (100, 101). Studies have shown that succinic acid produced by gut microbiota metabolism acts as an important mediator of the gut-lung axis during II/R. 16S rRNA sequencing showed that II/R could lead to the  imbalance  of  bacteria  producing  succinic  acid  and  bacteria consuming succinic acid in the intestine. The Simpson index and the ratio of Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes in the lung microbiota decreased significantly, resulting in the production and accumulation of succinic acid in the lung through the gut-lung axis, followed by SUCNR1dependent  macrophage  polarization  and  promotion  of  alveolar epithelial cell apoptosis to aggravate lung injury. The laboratory test results of patients with cardiopulmonary bypass also confirmed the above phenomenon, indicating that succinic acid may become a new biomarker for II/R-ALI (102).

From this point of view, the mechanisms of II/R-ALI are complex and closely related, such as the interaction between inflammation, oxidative  stress,  and  pyroptosis,  the  interaction  between  NETs formation and gut microbiota (103), which still need more research in the future to reveal.

## 4 Treatment approach

## 4.1 Pharmacological intervention

Numerous domestic and international researchers have conducted extensive investigations into drug therapies targeting the pathophysiological  mechanisms  of  II/R-ALI,  yielding  significant advancements. In addition to the well-established anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-apoptotic medications, surprising findings have emerged regarding the protective effects of propofol (104), dexmedetomidine  (105),  and  other  anesthetic  agents  commonly utilized during surgical procedures. It is worth mentioning that a clinical  case  report  published  in  2023  mentioned  that  the  use  of propofol during intestinal transplantation in a 20-year-old male infant effectively reduced the secondary damage caused by II/R (106). These anesthetic  drugs  not  only  contribute  to  patient  comfort  but  also demonstrate advantages in safeguarding perioperative organ function. However, more prospective and large-scale clinical trials in the future are still needed to provide strong evidence to support the reliability of laboratory-proven  methods  for  the  safe  and  effective clinical application of patients diseases.

With the increasing public attention to their health in recent years, people gradually realize the irreplaceable role of intestinal flora and its metabolites in the occurrence and development of diseases.

Microbiota  transplantation,  oral  probiotics  and  the  use  of  gut microbiota-derived metabolites have been proven to be prospective methods for the prevention and treatment of II/R-ALI, which can be safely and effectively applied in clinical practice (107, 108).

Moreover, drug administration has evolved from traditional oral or intravenous routes to the utilization of extracellular vesicles, such as exosomes (109), to facilitate targeted drug delivery to specific sites for pharmacological effects. At present, the separation of intestinalderived  exosomes  in  mouse  II/R  models  can  be  realized  at  the technical level, which will be very helpful for researchers to conduct follow-up clinical trials (110).

## 4.2 Surgical intervention

Operative treatments encompass ischemic preconditioning (IPC) and remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC).

IPC involves subjecting organs or tissues to one or more transient ischemia/reperfusion cycles before prolonged ischemia and reperfusion (111). Wang et al. (112) confirmed that intestinal IPC enhances the tolerance of the intestine and distal organs to subsequent prolonged ischemia, significantly enhances the body's antioxidant capacity,  suppresses  the  release  of  pro-inflammatory  cytokines  to mitigate SIRS, and reduces II/R-induced lung tissue apoptosis.

Remote ischemic  preconditioning  refers  to  the  application  of repeated transient non-lethal ischemia/reperfusion in organs or limbs to shield against subsequent distal organ ischemia/reperfusion injury. Hummitzsch et al. (113) demonstrated that subjecting Wistar rats to three bilateral hindlimb ischemic preconditioning sessions for 5 min each time significantly ameliorated local and distal intestinal damage caused by subsequent II/R. This may be due to the biologically active substances produced by the body after stimulation and released into the systemic circulation are transferred to the distal target organ or tissue for protection.

Although IPC has achieved good results in the prevention of II/R injury in animal experiments, it will bring side effects to patients in clinical  practice.  On  the  contrary,  RIPC,  an  effective,  simple  and low-risk  method,  can  be  easily  induced  by  transient  blood  flow obstruction using blood pressure cuffs (114), thereby enhancing its clinical translational potential. Other studies have corroborated that combined pretreatment with IPC and RIPC exerts a significantly more robust protective effect in the late stage of II/R (115). Future research can explore how to combine the two safely and effectively.

## 4.3 Stem cell therapy

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are pluripotent cells derived from the mesoderm, possessing self-renewal potential. As a prominent member of the stem cell family, MSCs find wide application in various clinical diseases (116). Research has demonstrated the protective effect of  bone  marrow-derived  mesenchymal  stem  cells  (BMSCs)  on II/R-ALI (117). The mechanism primarily involves two categories: (1) exogenous MSCs migrate to locally damaged intestinal tissues and differentiate into IEC, thereby ensuring the integrity of the intestinal barrier, reducing bacterial translocation, and mitigating distal lung injury; (2) exogenous MSCs exert anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative, anti-apoptotic effects, promote cell proliferation, and angiogenesis

through the release of cytokines. However, the protective effect of MSCs on II/R injury is limited to basic experiments such as cells and animals, and there is no relevant clinical study. Scholars are trying to make more MSCs reach the target tissue after intravenous injection to play  a  role  and  improve  the  efficiency  of  treatment.  MSCs  offer valuable insights for future research and clinical trials, representing a promising new treatment approach for II/R injury.

## 4.4 Traditional Chinese medicine therapy

With  its  extensive  historical  background,  traditional  Chinese medicine has witnessed significant growth in treatment approaches as an  understanding  of  its  theory  has  evolved.  Currently,  prominent

traditional Chinese medicine treatments for II/R-induced systemic diseases  include  conventional  Chinese  medicine  treatment  and acupuncture treatment. The effectiveness of Artesunate (18), Corilagin (17, 118), and Nervilifordin F (30), active ingredients of Artemisia annua ,  ellagic  tannin,  and Nervilia  fordii ,  has  been  confirmed  in preclinical studies of II/R-related diseases. The potential mechanism aligns with the aspects mentioned above. Traditional Chinese medicine offers the advantages of multi-target, multi-channel, multi-level, and minimal adverse reactions, providing a crucial guarantee for its safe and  practical  application  in  clinical  practice.  Acupuncture  is  a traditional Chinese medicine therapy. However, acupoint electrical stimulation (119) is a novel treatment method combining modern electroacupuncture therapy with standard acupuncture, which has the advantages of being non-invasive, safe, and not limited by time and

<!-- image -->

place. Acupoint electrical stimulation has been clinically utilized for many  years  to  prevent  and  treat  diseases  caused  by  ischemia/ reperfusion  of  various  organs  and  gastrointestinal  diseases  (120), yielding satisfactory results. It achieves the effect of 'Fuzheng Quxie' and  balancing  'Yin  and  Yang'  by  stimulating  the  conduction  of meridians and collaterals of the whole body and adjusting 'Gas-Blood and Zang-Fu.' Geng et al. (121) confirmed that acupoint electrical stimulation therapy not only directly improves systemic inflammation caused by II/R but also indirectly promotes the differentiation of MSCs, playing a synergistic therapeutic role. Therefore, the combination of traditional Chinese and Western medicine holds broad application prospects, offering new hope for treating various II/R-induced diseases.

## 4.5 Others

In the process of exploring the treatment of II/R-ALI, scientists have also  proposed  that  low-dose  laser  therapy  (122),  hyperbaric oxygen  therapy  (123),  hydrogen  inhalation  therapy  (124),  and microRNA-targeted regulation strategies (125) have specific mitigating effects on II/R-ALI (Figure 2). However, the specific dosage, treatment time and appropriate administration method still need to be  further  studied,  which  will  increase  the  challenge  of  clinical transformation of treatment methods.

## 5 Summarized and prospected

In  recent  years,  domestic  and  international  scholars  have conducted extensive research and exploration into the pathogenesis and treatment of II/R-ALI animal models. They have elucidated the mechanisms  of the inflammatory response, oxidative stress, apoptosis, ferroptosis, autophagy, and changes in the intestinal flora and their metabolites caused by II/R-ALI, leading to pathological changes in distal lung tissue. Significant progress has been made in strategies  aimed  at  improving  or  treating  ALI.  However,  current research  on  II/R-ALI  faces  several  challenges  that  hinder  the advancement  of  disease  treatment.  Firstly,  most  studies  about II/R-ALI are still in the preclinical research stage, primarily involving animal models or cell experiments, and there is a need for more relevant clinical case studies. Secondly, the pathophysiological and molecular mechanisms of II/R-ALI are complex, interrelated, and mutually reinforcing, with diverse manifestations of damage, making it  difficult  to  intervene  accurately  against  a  single  mechanism  or target.  This  significantly  complicates  the  exploration  of  disease treatment methods. Finally, the timing of administration, dosage, adverse  reactions,  pharmacokinetics,  and  toxicological  effects  of existing therapeutic drugs still need to be determined. The treatment

fficiency is low, as only a few MSCs reach the target tissue after intravenous  injection.  The  use  strategy  of  acupoint  electrical stimulation therapy in treating cerebral ischemia/reperfusion and myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury is relatively clear. Still, the exact mechanism of the therapeutic effect of II/R-ALI remains to be explored. Although many methods for the treatment of II/R-ALI have their advantages, they still have some limitations, which makes it impossible for scholars to reach a consensus on this, which will increase the challenge of clinical transformation of existing treatment methods. Therefore, actively seeking vital pathogenic mechanisms, proposing  new  research  perspectives  and  treatment  approaches, accelerating the development of clinical trials, and early intervention to halt the progress of II/R-ALI are expected to improve the cure rate of II/R-ALI.
