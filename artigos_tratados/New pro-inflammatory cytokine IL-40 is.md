## ABSTRACT

Objective Interleukin (IL)-  40 is a new cytokine related to immune system function and malignancies. Recently, an association of IL-  40 with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and externalisation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETosis) was found. As neutrophils are implicated in RA development, we investigated IL-  40 in early stages of RA (ERA).

Methods IL-  40 was determined in serum of treatment naïve patients with ERA at baseline (n=60) and 3 months after initiation of conventional therapy and in healthy controls (HC; n=60). Levels of IL-  40, cytokines and NETosis markers were measured by ELISA. NETosis was visualised by immunofluorescence. In vitro experiments were performed on peripheral blood neutrophils from ERA patients (n=14). Cell-  free DNA was analysed in serum and supernatants.

Results Serum IL-  40 was elevated in ERA compared with HC (p&lt;0.0001) and normalised after 3 months of therapy (p&lt;0.0001). Baseline serum IL-  40 correlated with rheumatoid factor (IgM) (p&lt;0.01), anti-  cyclic citrullinated peptide (p&lt;0.01) autoantibodies and NETosis markers (proteinase 3; neutrophil elastase (NE); myeloperoxidase) (p&lt;0.0001). Levels of NE significantly decreased after therapy (p&lt;0.01) and correlated with the decrease of serum IL-  40 (p&lt;0.05). In vitro, neutrophils enhanced IL-  40 secretion following NETosis induction (p&lt;0.001) or after exposure to IL-  1 β , IL-  8 (p&lt;0.05), tumour necrosis factor or lipopolysaccharide (p&lt;0.01). Recombinant IL-  40 upregulated IL-  1 β , IL-  6 and IL-  8 (p&lt;0.05 for all) in vitro. Conclusion We showed that IL-  40 is significantly up-  regulated in seropositive ERA and decreases after conventional therapy. Moreover, neutrophils are an important source of IL-  40 in RA, and its release is potentiated by cytokines and NETosis. Thus, IL-  40 may play a role in ERA.

## INTRODUCTION

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic autoimmune  disease  characterised  by  persistent synovial inflammation and articular damage. 1

,

1,2

## WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPIC

- ⇒ Interleukin  (IL)-  40  (IL-  40)  is  a  novel  B-  cell  associated  cytokine  related  to  immune  system  function, malignancies and autoimmune diseases.

## WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS

- ⇒ Elevated serum IL-  40 in early stages of rheumatoid arthritis  (RA)  patients  is  associated  with  increased externalisation of neutrophil extracellular traps and normalises following conventional pharmacological therapy.
- ⇒ We are the first to demonstrate IL-  40 as a neutrophilderived cytokine with pro-  inflammatory properties.

## HOW THIS STUDY MIGHT AFFECT RESEARCH, PRACTICE OR POLICY

- ⇒ The pro-  inflammatory cytokine IL-  40 is involved in the autoimmune response of the early stage of RA and may therefore become a future therapeutic target. Serum IL-  40 may serve clinicians as a predictive biomarker of treatment response in RA.
- ⇒ Given the novelty of IL-  40, our findings may initiate further  studies  on  IL-  40  in  other  autoimmune  diseases or neutrophil driven disorders.

During the last two decades, characterisation of  new  cytokines  and  their  signalling  pathways  has  helped  to  develop  new  treatment strategies  in  RA ;  however,  there  is  still  a 2 considerable number of patients who do not respond  to  the  standard-  of-  care  therapy  or progress rapidly after the onset of symptoms. 3 Timely  diagnosis  offers  the  opportunity  of starting  the  targeted  therapy  at  an  earlier stage of arthritis within the 'window of opportunity'  and  thereby  preventing  the  irreversible joint damage and disability.  As patients 4 with early RA (ERA) show a specific cytokine profile,  which  is  transient  and  no  longer

present in long-  standing RA, 5 6 it is urgent to search for new cytokines of the early phase of RA that could potentially serve as predictive biomarkers of RA development or treatment response.

Interleukin (IL)-  40  (encoded  by  the  C17orf99  gene) represents  one  of  the  newly  described  cytokines  implicated in autoimmune inflammation. 7-12 IL-  40  was  identified in 2017 as a small (27 kDa) secreted protein with a  unique  structure  distinct  from  any  known  cytokine family.  Initially, IL-  40 was detected in organs associated 7 with  the  immune  system  such  as  the  fetal  liver,  bone marrow or activated B-  cells potentiated by IL-  4 and transforming growth factor (TGF β )-  1. 7 8 13 Recent data show that IL-  40 is also expressed by other leucocytes or fibroblasts. 9 11 In mice, IL-  40 expression peaks with lactation, and C17orf99 / --mice  exert  microbiome  alternations, reduced  IgA  levels  and  impaired  B-  cell  functions.   In 7 addition, a link between IL-  40 and malignancy has been proposed based on the differential expression of IL-  40 found in B-  cell lymphomas. 7 14 15

To date, very little is known about the involvement of IL-  40 in immune processes. In 2012, IL-  40/C17orf99 was identified  as  one  of  the  specific  markers  distinguishing autoimmune hepatitis from healthy individuals. 16 A recent study by Gao et al revealed that IL-  40 expression decreases under anti-  inflammatory conditions in vitro. 17 Moreover, emerging evidence shows an implication of IL-  40 in the pathogenesis of autoimmune rheumatic diseases. 9-12 Rizzo et al demonstrated that IL-  40 is elevated in the serum and salivary glands of patients with primary Sjörgren syndrome (SS), and the tissue expression of IL-  40 correlates with the expression of pro-  fibrotic molecules IL-  4 and TGFβ . 9 In addition, recent data imply that altered expression of IL-  40 may be associated with lupus nephritis. 10 Very recently, an

upregulation of IL-  40 in RA was demonstrated. 11 12 Based on our study on RA, 11 the elevation of IL-  40 in RA is associated with disease activity, autoantibodies and the externalisation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETosis). We also demonstrated that elevated serum levels of IL-  40 significantly decreased following B-  cell depletion therapy (rituximab) in RA patients. According to our in vitro studies, IL-  40 acts as an inducer of chemokines, and metalloproteinase release by RA synovial fibroblasts. 11

Based  on  the  above-  mentioned  considerations,  we aimed to assess the implication of IL-  40 in the early phase of RA development by analysing serum levels of IL-  40 in treatment-  naïve ERA patients and investigating the relationship between IL-  40 and neutrophils.

## MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients

The  study enrolled 60 treatment naïve ERA  patients (40  women and 20 men) with a mean (SD) age of 52.4 (15.9) years and a symptom duration of up to 6 months. Serum from ERA patients was obtained in two intervals: at baseline and 3  months after the introduction of conventional pharmacological therapy. The patients fulfilled the 2010 American College  of  Rheumatology/EULAR  criteria. 18 The  control group consisted of 60 sex-  matched and age-  matched healthy individuals (healthy controls (HC), 40  women and 20 men) with a mean (SD) age of 52.4 (12.9) years. The characteristics of all participants are listed in table 1. For all in vitro experiments, peripheral blood from ERA patients was obtained (n=14 in total).

## Laboratory measurements

Serum  samples  from  ERA  patients  (n=60)  and  HC (n=60) were obtained and immediately stored at -80°C.

Disease activity was assessed by the Disease Activity Score for  28  joints  (DAS28)  using  erythrocyte  sedimentation rate. C reactive protein (CRP) was measured by turbidimetry (Olympus Biochemical Analyser; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan), and the levels of serum anti-  cyclic citrullination peptide  (anti-  CCP) antibodies and  IgM  rheumatoid factor (IgM-  RF) were evaluated by ELISA kits (both from TestLine  Clinical  Diagnostics,  Brno,  Czech  Republic). Antinuclear antibodies (ANA) were detected by indirect immunofluorescence  (Immuno  Concepts,  Sacramento, CA, USA) and further characterised by the Line Immuno Assay (LIA) method (IMTEC, Wiesbaden, Germany).

## In vitro experiments on neutrophils from patients with ERA

Neutrophils  were  separated  from  the  peripheral  blood of  ERA  patients  using  Ficoll  gradient  separation  and dextran  sedimentation,  followed  by  hypotonic  lysis  of erythrocytes as previously described. 17 The viability and the cell count of isolated neutrophils were determined by Countess II FL Automated cell counter (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA) using Trypan Blue staining (mean 95%). The purity of isolated neutrophils was assessed by flow  cytometry  (CD45,  CD15  and  CD16  positive  cells, mean 98%). As isolation technology may affect neutrophil function, 19 we  reproduced part our in vitro experiments on neutrophils purified using negative selection by magnetic beads (EasySep Magnet and EasySep Direct Human Neutrophil Isolation Kit, StemCell Technologies, USA). All isolated neutrophils were transferred into 6-  well plates  (1×10   per  well)  in  RPMI-  1640  culture  medium 6 (Thermo Fisher) containing  10%  heat-  inactivated  fetal bovine serum (Biowest, Nuaillé, France), 0.2% GlutaMax and 0.2% HEPES solution (both from Sigma-  Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA).

To assess the effect of extracellular IL-  40 on neutrophils in vitro, neutrophils were stimulated with recombinant IL-  40 (10, 50, 100 and 250 ng/mL, Aviva Systems Biology, San Diego, CA, USA) and with lipopolysaccharide as a positive control (LPS, 100 ng/mL, LPS from E. coli O26:B6, Sigma-  Aldrich) for an interval of 4 hours and/or 24 hours at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO . Simultaneously, to induce NETosis, neutro2 phils were treated with phorbol 12-  myristate-  13-  acetate (PMA;  100 nM,  Sigma-  Aldrich)  for  4 hours  under  the conditions  described  above.  In  order  to  evaluate  the potential  inducers  of  IL-  40,  neutrophils  were  treated with recombinant proteins IL-  1 β , IL-  6 and IL-  8, tumour necrosis  factor  (TNF)  (all  10 ng/mL,  R&amp;D  Systems, Minneapolis,  MN,  USA),  and  LPS  for  24 hours  as described  above.  Cell  supernatants  were  collected, centrifuged  at  86 g  for  10 min  at  room  temperature (RT), and stored at -80°C until use. LPS serotype from E. coli O26:B6 (Sigma-  Aldrich) was selected as a positive control that induces an inflammatory response but not NETosis. 20 21 The IL-  40 dose was selected based on the serum and synovial fluid levels found in patients with long-  standing RA. 11

## Immunofluorescence visualisation of NETosis

Following isolation, ERA neutrophils were seeded onto poly-  L-  lysine  (Sigma-  Aldrich)  coated  coverslips  (3×10 4 cells  per  coverslip)  which  were  placed  into  the  12-  well plates with 500 µL of cultivation medium and treated by IL-  40 (250  ng/mL) and PMA (100 nM) in concentrations and conditions described above. After 4 hour, neutrophils were  fixed  with  4%  formalin  solution  (Sigma-  Aldrich) for 30  min at RT, 2x washed with PBS and incubated with wheat  germ  agglutinin  (WGA)  Alexa  Fluor  488  conjugate (5 µg/mL, Thermo Fisher) for 10 min at RT. Consequently,  cells  were  3x  washed  with  PBS  and  permeabilized with 0.2%Triton X (Sigma-  Aldrich) for 5 min at RT. Next, cells were 3x washed with PBS and incubated with 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS for 1 hour at RT. Slides were incubated with mouse anti-  human myeloperoxidase (MPO) monoclonal antibody over night at 4°C (1:200,  Invitrogen,  Carlsbad,  CA,  USA)  and  C17orf99 rabbit  anti-  human  polyclonal  antibody  (1:700,  Sinobiological, Eschborn, Germany) for 3 hours at RT. Following 3x wash in PBS, slides were treated with secondary antibodies  goat  anti-  mouse  Abberior  STAR  RED  and  goat anti-  rabbit  Abberior  STAR  580  (both  1:500,  Abberior Instruments  GmbH,  Göttingen,  Germany)  for  1 hour at  RT.  Finally,  slides  were  3x  washed  with  PBS,  treated with 4 ,6-  diamidino-  2-  phenylindole (DAPI, 1:1000. Invit-' rogen) for 10 min at RT, samples were 3x washed in PBS and  1x  in  distilled  water  and  mounted  with  Abberior Mount Liquid Antifade (Abberior Instruments GmbH). All antibody dilutions were made in 2% BSA in PBS. All incubations were performed in humid chamber.

## Microscopy analysis

The  images  were  obtained  using  a  combination  of confocal and superresolution microscopy. DAPI and WGA 488 were acquired in confocal mode and images of MPO (STAR RED) and IL-  40 (STAR 580) in cell detail were acquired  using  stimulated  emission  depletion  (STED) microscopy. The imaging was performed on an Abberior Expert Line STED system (Abberior Instruments GmbH) equipped with a Nikon Eclipse Ti-  E body (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan), QUAD beam scanner and Nikon CFI Plan Apo 60x/NA  1.40  oil-  immersion objective (Nikon). The samples were illuminated with 405 nm, 485 nm, 561 nm and 640 nm lasers. The fluorescence excited with 561 and 640 nm laser was depleted by a pulsed 775 nm STED laser in 2D donut shape. The fluorescence signal passed the pinhole set to 1 AU, was filtered by emission filters (422467 nm, 506-594 nm, 580-630 nm and 650-720 nm) and the  signal  was  detected  with  single-  photon  counting detectors (Excelitas Technologies, Waltham, MA, USA). The  images  were  obtained  by  the  Inspector  software (Abberior Instruments GmbH).

## Analysis of IL-40, cytokines and NETosis markers

IL-  40 levels in the serum and supernatants were assessed by  a  commercially  available  ELISA  kit  (MyBioSource, San Diego, CA, USA) with a detection limit of 0.25 ng/

mL and inter-  assay and intra-  assay reliability  &lt;15%. The levels of NETosis-  related markers, such as MPO, neutrophil  elastase  (NE)  (both  Abcam,  Cambridge,  UK)  and proteinase 3 (PR3) (BioVendor, Brno, Czech Republic), were measured using commercially available ELISA kits in  the  serum  and  supernatants.  Similarly,  the  levels  of TNF,  IL-  1 β ,  IL-  6  and  IL-  8  were  analysed  by  ELISA  kits in  the  supernatants  (Invitrogen).  All  ELISA  tests  were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions, and the analysis was performed at 450 nm using a Sunrise ELISA reader (Tecan, Salzburg, Austria).

## Analysis of cell-free DNA

Circulating cell-  free DNA (cfDNA) was isolated from the serum of patients with ERA and from neutrophil supernatants by use of QIAamp Circulating Nucleic Acid Kit (Quiagen,  Hilden,  Germany).  The  concentration  of cfDNA was analysed by Agilent High Sensitivity DNA Kit on Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (both Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA).

## Statistical analysis

Data are presented as mean (SEM) unless stated otherwise.  The  normal  distribution  was  determined  using the  Kolmogorov-  Smirnov  test.  Wilcoxon  matched-  pairs signed rank test was used to compare IL-  40 levels in ERA patients at baseline and after 3 months of therapy. Fisher's  exact  test  was  used  to  determine  if  the  proportion of  patients  with  decreasing  IL-  40  significantly  differs between double seropositive and seronegative patients. It  was  also  used  for  in  vitro  experiments  to  compare cytokines levels in treated versus non-  treated neutrophils. Mann-  Whitney test was used to assess the differences in IL-  40 levels between HC and ERA patients. The association of IL-  40 with laboratory and clinical parameters and cytokines was determined by Spearman correlation. The results were considered significant when p was less than 0.05  (*p&lt;0.05,  **p&lt;0.01,  ***p&lt;0.001,  ****p&lt;0.0001). For data analysis,  GraphPad Prism 6 software was used (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA).

## RESULTS

## Increased IL-40 correlates with autoantibody levels and decreases after conventional treatment in the serum of ERA patients

The levels of IL-  40  were  elevated  in  the  serum  of  ERA patients (n=60) compared with HC (n=60) (4.51 (0.91) vs 1.47 (0.09) ng/mL, p&lt;0.0001) and were normalised after 3 months of conventional treatment (4.51 (0.91) vs 1.98 (0.24)  ng/mL; p&lt;0.0001) (figure 1A). Moreover, levels of IL-  40 were significantly higher in double-  seropositive (RF  (IgM) anti-  CCP )  (n=23)  compared  with  double-+ + seronegative (RF (IgM) anti-  CCP ) -(n=26) patients (7.77  (2.15)  vs  1.95  (0.23)  ng/mL;  p&lt;0.0001)  and  also in double-  seronegative patients compared with HC (1.95 (0.23) vs 1.47 (0.09) ng/mL, p&lt;0.01) (see colour coding in figure 1A). The decrease of IL-  40 levels following the therapy  was  more  pronounced  in  double  seropositive

(p&lt;0.0001) in contrast to double seronegative (p&lt;0.05) patients  (figure  1B,C).  Using  Fisher's  exact  test,  we showed that the proportion of patients with decreasing IL-  40 in both groups is significant (p=0.026).

We were interested in whether patients with high and low  IL-  40  levels  have  a  different  treatment  response. Therefore, we divided the group of seropositive patients into  two  subgroups:  high  and  low  IL-  40  (cut-  off  value 6  ng/mL) and analysed the effect of treatment on inflammation  and  disease  activity  in  each  subgroup.  When evaluating  the  treatment  response  in  double  seropositive RA patients with high and low IL-  40 levels, we found no significant  difference  in  the  decrease  of  CRP  levels (p&lt;0.01 for both). However, double seropositive patients with high IL-  40 levels appeared to have a better statistically significant improvement in clinical disease activity as assessed by DAS28 (p&lt;0.01) compared with patients with low IL-  40 levels (p&lt;0.05). Thus, it can be speculated that elevated IL-  40 levels in the context of seropositivity may represent a suitable biomarker of treatment response.

In  all  ERA  patients,  serum  IL-  40  strongly  correlated with the levels of both autoantibodies RF (IgM) (r=0.461, p&lt;0.01) and anti-  CCP (r=0.407, p&lt;0.01) (n=60) (figure  1D,E).  In  addition,  16  out  of  60  patients  with ERA  tested  positive  for  ANA  autoantibodies;  however, the levels of IL-  40 were comparable between ANA positive and ANA negative patients (figure 1F). IL-  40 did not correlate with any other clinical or laboratory parameters of interest, with the exception of a weak positive correlation (r=0.290, p=0.035) of IL-  40 with CRP levels after 3 months of therapy (online supplemental data 1).

## Serum IL-40 is associated with NETosis markers and with the changes of serum NE levels after therapy in patients with ERA

Given our previous finding of the link between IL-  40 and NETosis in RA, 11 we sought to analyse this phenomenon in the early phase of RA. Here we show that the levels of NETosis markers MPO, PR3 and NE were up-  regulated in all ERA patients at baseline (n=60) in contrast to HC (n=60)  MPO:  125.80  (16.01)  versus  43.59  (2.95)  ng/ mL; p&lt;0.0001, PR3: 204.30 (18.05) versus 103.80 (6.55) ng/mL; p&lt;0.0001 and NE: 360.00 (35.63) versus 122.90 (9.43)  ng/mL;  p&lt;0.0001)  (figure  2A).  At  baseline,  the levels of IL-  40 correlated with peripheral blood neutrophil  count  (r=0.351,  p&lt;0.05)  (figure  2B)  and  with  the surrogate  NETosis  markers  (n=60)  such  as  neutrophil granule enzymes PR3 (r=0.581, p&lt;0.0001), NE (r=0.613, p&lt;0.0001), MPO  (r=0.593,  p&lt;0.0001)  (figure  2C-E) and with the levels of cfDNA (r=0.314, p=0.066) (n=35) (figure 2F).

Moreover,  the  levels  of  prime  neutrophil  granule enzymes  MPO  and  NE  positively  correlate  with  the increased levels of cfDNA (n=35) (MPO: r=0.355, p=0.036; NE:  r=0.450,  p=0.007),  which  rules  out  possible  causes of their upregulation other than NETosis. Only a trend towards  the  association  between  PR3  and  cfDNA  was found (r=0.291, p=0.090). To assess whether the therapy modulates  the  serum  IL-  40  levels  simultaneously  with

Figure 1 The levels of IL-  40 are significantly elevated in the serum of ERA patients at baseline (n=60) compared with HC (n=60) and normalise after 3  months of therapy (A). The decrease in IL-  40 levels is more prominent in double seropositive (B) compared with double seronegative (C) patients in response to the therapy. Serum IL-  40 is associated with serum levels of RF (IgM) (D) and anti-  CCP (E) autoantibodies in all ERA patients at baseline (n=60). There was no significant difference between serum levels of IL-  40 in ANA positive and negative ERA patients at baseline (F). Horizontal lines represent the mean (SEM). The association of IL-  40 with autoantibodies was analysed using Spearman correlation. *p&lt;0.05; ****p&lt;0.0001.

NETosis, we analysed levels of NE, as one of the NETosis parameters, in ERA patients both before and after the therapy. We showed a significant decrease of the serum NE after therapy (361.80 (35.08) vs 213.40 (23.40) ng/ mL;  p=0.002),  which  was  positively  associated  with  the downregulation of serum IL-  40 (r=0.360, p&lt;0.05) (n=46).

## Activated neutrophils increase IL-40 secretion, which, in turn, can promote a positive inflammatory feedback loop

The  association  of  IL-  40  with  activated  neutrophils  is underlined by our in vitro experiments showing an abundant  release  of  IL-  40  by  ERA  neutrophils  undergoing NETosis  (n=11)  on  PMA  stimulation  compared  with untreated  neutrophils  (3873  (677)  vs  1361  (286)  pg/ mL, p&lt;0.001) (figure 3A). This is further confirmed by the immunofluorescence  staining  demonstrating  the externalisation  of  IL-  40  during  PMA-  induced  NETosis (figure 4). This analysis provided additional data regarding the possible subcellular localisation of IL-  40 in

neutrophils. Based on our observation, IL-  40 was localised in the cytoplasm and within the cytoplasmic membrane (WGA)  in  unstimulated  cells.  In  PMA-  treated  cells,  a partial  overlap  of  IL-  40  with  membrane  was  detected. Interestingly, IL-  40 did not colocalise with either MPO or DNA in both, unstimulated or PMA-  treated cells.

In  addition  to  NETosis  as  a  trigger  for  IL-  40  release, we also demonstrated that neutrophils activated by proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-  1 β , IL-  8 and TNF, but not IL-  6, increased IL-  40 secretion compared with untreated cells  (n=9)  (IL-  1 β :  1770  (263)  vs  1296  (299)  pg/mL, p&lt;0.05; TNF: 3816 (671) vs 1296 (299) pg/mL, p&lt;0.01; IL-  8: 1902 (207) vs 1296 (299) pg/mL, p&lt;0.05). Similarly, neutrophils exposed to LPS significantly enhanced IL-  40 production in contrast to untreated cells (8163 (924) vs 1296 (299) pg/mL, p&lt;0.01) (figure 3B). Finally, we show that recombinant IL-  40 has the potential to trigger the release of pro-  inflammatory cytokines IL-  1 β (100 ng/mL

The representative images show fluorescent staining of DNA (blue), wheat germ agglutinin that binds to the plasma membrane (WGA, magenta), and immunofluorescent staining of neutrophil marker myeloperoxidase (MPO, red) and IL-  40 (green) and their merged images. In non-  NETotic neutrophils (ctrl), IL-  40 partially overlaps with the intact plasmatic membrane (white arrow). A small proportion of IL-  40 signal can also be observed in the cytoplasmic area (white arrow heads). IL-  40 in the central part of the cell does not merge with MPO. PMA-  treated neutrophils release decondensed chromatin that does not colocalise with IL-  40 (green arrows). Similarly, DNA-  appendant MPO does not merge with IL-  40. There is a partial overlap in IL-  40 signal and plasma membrane remnants (blue arrows).

Recombinant IL-  40 in the concentration 10 ng/mL did not  affect  the  secretion  of  pro-  inflammatory  cytokines (figure  3C-F).  As  different  techniques  of  purification may  affect  the  activity  of  neutrophils, 19 these  results were  further  verified  on  neutrophils  isolated  by  negative  selection  by  magnetic  beads.  Consistent  with  our results described above, recombinant IL-  40 significantly

up-  regulated  the  secretion  of  IL-  1 β and  IL-  8  in  dose dependent manner (data not shown).

Finally,  we  proved  that  recombinant  IL-  40  does  not induce NETosis in neutrophils from  ERA  patients, as demonstrated by immunofluorescence staining (figure  5A)  and  analysis  of  cfDNA  and  MPO  levels (figure 5B,C) in neutrophils exposed to IL-  40.

## DISCUSSION

In this study, we demonstrate for the first time that IL-  40 is produced by activated neutrophils and is implicated in the early stage of RA development. IL-  40 is elevated in the serum of ERA patients and correlates with the levels of autoantibodies, neutrophil count and NETs formation. Our  in  vitro  experiments  show  increased  IL-  40  secretion  in  neutrophils  on  exposure  to  pro-  inflammatory

cytokines or during NETosis. Moreover, IL-  40 positively regulates  inflammation  in  neutrophils  via  secretion  of IL-  1 β , IL-  6 and IL-  8.

Here, we show that IL-  40 is up-  regulated in the serum of ERA  patients  compared  with  healthy  individuals, which  is  in  agreement  with  studies  on  patients  with RA 11 12 and SS  and further highlights the role of IL-  40 in 9 the pathogenesis of autoimmune inflammation. As this study  was  performed  simultaneously  with  the  study  on RA 11 with sample replicates to assess plate-  to-  plate consistency, we can state that the levels of IL-  40 in patients with ERA are approximately two times lower compared with long-  standing  RA. 11 This  could  be  partly  explained  by

the fact that early acute stages of RA are accompanied by a specific cytokine milieu in concentrations that are transitional  and  different  from  those  present  during chronic inflammation. 5 6 22 Similar to long-  standing RA, 11 IL-  40 levels were higher in double seropositive compared with seronegative patients. However, as the seronegative subgroup  still  shows  upregulation  of  IL-  40  compared with healthy individuals, we believe that the occurrence of  IL-  40  is  not  strictly  related  to  the  presence  of  autoantibodies alone. Accordingly, downregulation of IL-  40 after therapy was more pronounced in double seropositive patients; however, also significant for the seronegative subgroup. Interestingly, there was no association of

IL-  40 with parameters of inflammation or disease activity, except for a weak correlation with CRP after 3 months of  therapy,  which  should  be  interpreted  with  caution, as  no  analogous  correlation  of  these  two  parameters were found at baseline or during the therapy. Moreover, serum  IL-  40  levels  positively  correlate  with  peripheral blood  neutrophil  count  in  ERA,  which  is  in  line  with the  neutrophil-  related  expression  of  IL-  40  found  in the synovial fluid and tissue of long-  standing RA. 11 It  is well  established  that  neutrophils  play  an  essential  role in  the  initiation  and  progression of RA 23 ;  furthermore, dysregulation  of  NETosis  in  RA  has  been  described. 24 Our findings of elevated NETosis markers in the serum of  ERA  patients  and  their  association  with  cfDNA  and serum IL-  40 further highlight the link between IL-  40 and activated  neutrophils  in  the  early  phase  of  RA.  As  the presence of autoantibodies increases the NETs production in RA 25 and IL-  40 is related to both autoantibodies and NETosis in ERA, we can speculate that IL-  40 may be involved  in  the  pathological  crosstalk  between  neutrophils  and  B-  cells.  This  is  underscored  by  the  fact  that the  upregulation  of  serum  IL-  40  and  NETosis  markers is  more  pronounced  in  double  seropositive  compared with  seronegative  patients  (data  not  shown).  However, this  requires  further  investigation.  In  addition  to  that, we  found  a  positive  correlation  between  the  decrease in  serum  IL-  40  and  the  selected  NETosis  marker  NE following conventional pharmacological therapy in ERA patients.  In  this  context,  studies  suggested  an  indirect inhibition  of  NETs  production  via  downregulation  of reactive  oxygen  species  following  conventional  therapy with  either  methotrexate 26 or  glucocorticoids. 27 Thus, based  on  the  abovementioned  evidence  and  on  the parallel downregulation of IL-  40 and NE, we believe that neutrophils undergoing NETosis are a significant source of IL-  40 in treatment-  naïve ERA patients. In support of this, our in vitro data demonstrate that PMA-  challenged neutrophils undergoing NETosis abundantly release IL-  40 Indeed, we showed that pro-  inflammatory cytokines

involved  in  RA  immunopathology,  TNF  in  particular, could  stimulate  neutrophil  secretion  of  IL-  40  in  vitro. Although TNF was the most potent inducer of IL-  40 in neutrophils  among  all  the  studied  cytokines,  anti-  TNF therapy does not seem to have significant effect on the levels of IL-  40 in RA patients. 11 Considering the novelty and the lack of data on IL-  40, TNF may represent only one of many IL-  40  inducing  factors  just  as  neutrophils may be only one fraction of its potential cellular sources.

The observed extracellular release of IL-  40 from activated  neutrophils  is  in  line  with  the  presence  of  IL-  40 in  the  cytoplasm  of  neutrophils  detected  by  immunofluorescence.  All  this  is  consistent  with  the  description of IL-  40 as a soluble secreted protein.  Nevertheless, we 7 also demonstrated that IL-  40 associates with the plasma membrane, which is agreement with study of Zhang et al , 28 who predicted IL-  40 to be an 'intrinsic component of the plasma membrane'. It should be noted that the colocalisation of IL-  40 with WGA (plasma membrane marker) in  NETotic  cells  must  be  interpreted  with  caution,  as WGA may have also affinity for some intracellular carbohydrates  that  are  exposed  during  NETosis.  Overall,  we could  speculate  that  IL-  40  may  potentially  exist  as  two variants, a soluble and a membrane-  bound form. Future studies should therefore focus on addressing some of the questions raised by these results.

Given the accumulation of IL-  40 in the circulation of patients with ERA, we sought to explore the interaction between IL-  40 and neutrophils in vitro. We showed that extracellular  IL-  40  potentiates  neutrophils  to  release cytokines IL-  1 β ,  IL-  6  and  IL-  8,  some  of  which  could  in turn  stimulate  the  secretion  of  IL-  40  by  neutrophils, and thereby perpetuate the inflammatory loop. Importantly, IL-  1 β , IL-  6 and IL-  8 are among the key cytokines dominating RA from the very beginning. 29 In  addition, the  potential  of  IL-  40  to  induce  IL-  8  was  previously observed in RA synovial fibroblasts. 11 Nevertheless, it is important  to  note  that  the  pro-  inflammatory  effect  of IL-  40 on neutrophils was observed at the concentrations

of IL-  40 (50-250  ng/mL) that rather reflect the inflammatory milieu in the joint than in the blood circulation. Our data on pro-  inflammatory role of IL-  40 are further supported by the study of Gao et al who explored the antiinflammatory effects of IL-  38 on poly (I:C)-  induced lung inflammation  in  vitro  and  showed  that  IL-  38  reduces IL-  40 gene expression. 17 Collectively, our findings imply that IL-  40 may be involved in the neutrophils associated inflammatory response in the early phase of RA development (figure 6).

However, this study has some limitations. First, a longterm  longitudinal  study  would  be  beneficial  to  follow the  kinetics  of  IL-  40  in  relation  to  disease  activity  and radiographic progression. Moreover, our study involved the analysis of IL-  40 in the serum but not in the synovial  fluid  samples,  which  altogether  would  provide  a more complete overview of the implication of IL-  40 in RA  development  and  progression.  Since  IL-  40  seems to be more linked to the autoantibody-  positive form of RA,  studies  elucidating  the  cross  talk  between  B-  cells and  neutrophils  should  be  performed  in  the  future. Finally, the molecular mechanisms underlying the proinflammatory  effect  of  IL-  40  on  neutrophils  need  to be  investigated.  Despite  these  limitations,  this  study provides a better understanding of the role of recently discovered  cytokine  IL-  40  in  the  pathogenesis  of  RA and  demonstrates  that  activated  neutrophils  are  an important source of IL-  40 in early RA.

## CONCLUSIONS

Taken together, this study brings a new insight into the contribution of IL-  40 to the pathogenesis of seropositive RA. IL-  40 is elevated in the serum of patients with ERA and correlates with levels of autoantibodies, neutrophil count and markers of NETosis, indicating its role in the acute  flare-  up  and  impaired  immune  response.  More importantly, we demonstrate that IL-  40 is a neutrophilderived  cytokine,  whose  secretion  requires  a  specific pro-  inflammatory  environment  that  seems  to  be  met in  the  ERA. In addition, extracellular IL-  40 exerts proinflammatory effects on neutrophils and thereby participates in the amplification of the immune reaction in RA.
