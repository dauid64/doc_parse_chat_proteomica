## Sex differences in immune responses

Sabra L. Klein 1  and Katie L. Flanagan 2

Abstract | Males and females differ in their immunological responses to foreign and self-antigens and show distinctions in innate and adaptive immune responses. Certain immunological sex differences are present throughout life, whereas others are only apparent after puberty and before reproductive senescence, suggesting that both genes and hormones are involved. Furthermore, early environmental exposures influence the microbiome and have sex-dependent effects on immune function. Importantly, these sex-based immunological differences contribute to variations in the incidence of autoimmune diseases and malignancies, susceptibility to infectious diseases and responses to vaccines in males and females. Here, we discuss these differences and emphasize that sex is a biological variable that should be considered in immunological studies.

Sex is a biological variable that affects immune responses to both self and foreign antigens (for example, those from fungi, viruses, bacteria, parasites and allergens). The sex of an individual is defined by the differential organization of chromosomes, reproductive organs, and sex steroid levels; it is distinct from gender, which includes behaviours and activities that are determined by society or culture in humans. Male and female differ­ ences in immunological responses may be influenced by both sex and gender, with sex contributing to physio  logi­ cal and anatomical differences that influence exposure, recognition, clearance, and even transmission of micro­ organisms. By contrast, gender may reflect behaviours that influence exposure to microorganisms, access to healthcare or health­seeking behaviours that affect the course of infection. Although we acknowledge that both sex and gender influence the immune response, the focus of this Review will be on the biological factors that influence immunological differences between the sexes. Despite a growing body of literature illustrating sex­based differences in immune responses, immunol­ ogy ranks the lowest of ten biological disciplines for reporting the sex of animal or human subjects in pub­ lished papers, with fewer than 10% of articles analysing data by sex . The field of sex­based biology is under­ 1 going a revolution, in which research funding agencies and journals have launched policies to promote greater consideration, reporting and analyses of sex and gender in the biomedical sciences in an effort to improve rigour and reproducibility (BOX 1) .

It is increasingly important to acknowledge sex dif­ ferences in immune responses when we consider the marked differences seen between males in females in various diseases. For instance, 80% of autoimmune dis­ ease occurs in females, women with acute HIV infection

have 40% less viral RNA in their blood than men, men show an almost twofold higher risk of death from malignant cancer than women and antibody responses to seasonal influenza vaccines are consistently at least twice as strong in women than men. Generally, adult females mount stronger innate and adaptive immune responses than males. This results in faster clearance of pathogens and greater vaccine efficacy in females than in males but also contributes to their increased suscepti­ bility to inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. In this Review, we explain how these immunological differences between the sexes reflect hormonal, genetic and environ­ mental effects on the immune system that can change throughout life in humans.

## Phylogeny of sex differences in immunity

Mounting immune responses that are necessary for the recognition, response and clearance of pathogens requires metabolic resources that might otherwise be used for other biological processes, such as growth, maintenance of secondary sex characteristics and reproduction. Trade­ offs are likely to exist for life strategies that affect survival and reproduction . Several theories posit that increased 2 pathogen loads and reduced immune function among males are an adverse side effect of positive selection for other traits or characteristics that increase reproduc­ tive success and survival . Sex differences in immune 2 responses have evolved in diverse species ranging from insects to lizards, birds and mammals; in all of these species, both innate and adaptive immune responses are typically lower in males than in females (TABLE 1) . In Drosophila melanogaster , for example, many of the genes that encode for innate signalling proteins are found on the X chromosome and show sex­specific induction following fungal or bacterial infection 3,4 . In lizards, the

## Box 1 | A brief history of sex and gender-based research in the US

The history of excluding females from clinical studies is reflected in the 1977 US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidelines advising that women of childbearing potential should be excluded from drug trials. These recommendations resulted in inadequate representation of women in clinical trials for decades. In the early 1990s, the FDA and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in the US, with advocacy from US Congresswomen, recommended that clinical trials should include female subjects. Although women are now included in clinical trials of drugs, devices and biologics, there remains inadequate analysis of whether outcomes differ between men and women or boys and girls. Of drugs withdrawn from the US market from 1997-2000, the US Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported that 8 out of 10 drugs taken off the market had greater adverse effects in women. In 2015, the US GAO documented that although more women than men currently enrol in NIH-funded clinical research, the NIH does not ensure that these studies are designed to identify differences between men and women in disease processes and responses to treatment. Preclinical studies in animal models and cell culture systems could help to prevent these costly mistakes but, here too, analysis of potential sex effects has been lacking. Following behind policy changes in Canada and Europe, in 2015 the NIH announced new policies to ensure that sex is considered as a biological variable in preclinical research in an effort to increase rigour and reproducibility.

phagocytic activity of macrophages is greater in females than in males owing to the suppressive effects of andro­ gens on male macrophage activity . In birds, females 5 exhibit higher antibody and cell­mediated immune responses to immune challenges, and these effects are often most pronounced during the mating season when male testosterone concentrations are highest 6,7 .

## Sex differences in innate immunity in mammals

Among mammals, males and females differ in their innate immune responses, which suggests that some sex differences may be germline encoded (TABLE 2) . For example, innate detection of nucleic acids by pat­ tern recognition receptors (PRRs) differs between the sexes. The Toll­like receptor 7 ( TLR7 ) gene, encoded on the X chromosome, may escape X inactivation result­ ing in higher expression levels of TLR7 in females than males 8 . Exposure of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) to TLR7 ligands in vitro causes higher pro­ duction of interferon­α (IFNα) in cells from women than from men 9 ; in addition, plasma  cytoid dendritic cells  (pDCs) from female humans and mice have higher basal levels of IFN regulatory factor 5 (IRF5) and IFNα production following TLR7 ligand stimu­ lation 10 . Transcriptional regulation of IRF5 in female mice is under the control of signalling through oestro­ gen receptor­α (ERα) 10 . Stimulation of DCs with CpG, a TLR9 ligand, results in no sex bias in IFNα production . 9 Transcriptional analyses reveal sex differences in the expression of genes along TLR pathways and induction of type I IFN responses. Following either   vaccination in adult humans or virus challenge in adult rats, the expression of TLR­pathway and pro­  inflammatory genes (for example, TLR7 , myeloid differentiation pri­ mary response gene 88 ( MYD88 ), retinoic acid indu  cible gene­I ( RIGI ), IRF7 IFNB , , Janus kinase 2 ( JAK2 ), sig­ nal transducer and activator of transcription ( STAT3 , ) nuclear factor­κB ( NFKB ), IFNG and tumour necrosis factor ( TNF )) is higher in female than male PBMCs from humans and tissues from rats 11,12 . Putative androgen

R

response elements (AREs) and oestrogen response ele­ ments (EREs) are present in the promoters of several innate immunity genes, suggesting that sex steroids may directly cause dimorphic innate immune responses 12 .

The production of cytokines and chemokines by innate immune cells also differs between the sexes. Activation of TLR9 with viral or synthetic ligands in PBMCs from human males results in greater   interleukin­  10 (IL­10) production compared with PBMCs from females, which is positively correlated with androgen concentration in males 13 . PBMCs from human males produce more TNF than PBMCs from females following lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation 14,15 . Neutrophils from human males express higher levels of TLR4 and produce more TNF than female neutrophils both constitutively and follow­ ing activation with LPS 16 . Peritoneal macrophages from male mice express higher levels of TLR4 and produce more CXC­chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL10) follow­ ing LPS stimulation than macrophages from females 17 . Peritoneal macrophages isolated from female rodents produce higher levels of anti­inflammatory prostanoids than male­derived cells following LPS treatment 17 . Because TLR4 expression is greater on immune cells from males than females, stimulation with LPS results in greater pro­inflammatory cytokine production by male immune cells, which can be reversed by removal of androgens in male rodents 18 . By contrast, higher expres­ sion of TLR7 in immune cells from females compared with males seems to cause greater cytokine production by female immune cells and is regulated by sex chromo­ some expression. The sex differential expression of PRRs is crucial for interpreting sex­specific activity of innate immune cells following stimulation.

The number and activity of cells associated with innate immunity differ between the sexes. Males have higher natural killer (NK) cell frequencies than females 19 . The phagocytic activity of neutrophils and macrophages is higher in females than males 20 . Antigen­presenting cells (APCs) from females are more efficient at present­ ing peptides than APCs from males 21 . Finally, sex dif­ ferences are also seen in innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), which are innate­like lymphocytes that regulate an array of tissue immune responses through the production of effector cytokines. Dysregulation of ILCs is linked to the development of autoimmune diseases, and females reportedly have reduced numbers of type 2 ILCs, which is hypothesized to contribute to their increased suscep­ tibility to demyelination in a mouse model of multiple sclerosis 22 .

## Sex differences in adaptive immunity in mammals

Sex influences multiple aspects of adaptive immunity (FIG. 1; TABLE 2) . The thymus plays a pivotal part in the development of the adaptive immune system by produ­ cing the peripheral T cell pool. Early in life, male rats have larger thymuses, greater thymocyte counts and differential distribution of thymocyte subsets compared with female rats 23,24 .

Among adult humans, sex differences in lympho­ cyte subsets - including B cells, CD4 + T cells and CD8 +  T cells - are described for multiple ethnic groups

including Europeans, Asians, and Africans. Females (both children and adults) have higher CD4 + T cell counts and higher CD4/CD8 ratios than age­matched males 19,25-27 ; whereas males have higher CD8  T cell fre­ + quencies 25-27 . Following in vitro stimulation of PBMCs, women have higher numbers of activated CD4 + T cells and CD8 + T cells and proliferating T cells in peripheral blood compared to men 19,28 . Transcriptional analyses indicate greater cytotoxic T cell activity in adult females, with PMA-ionomycin­stimulated T cells from women upregulating more antiviral genes (such as IFNG RIGI , , SPINK5 OAS1 , and IFI6 ) and pro­inflammatory genes (for  example, IL12RB2 , IL1F5 , CXC3CL1 , CXCL2 and IL16 ) compared with T cells isolated from men 29 . Notably, half of the activated genes in female T cells have EREs in their promoters 29 .

The activity and distribution of CD4  T cell subsets + differ between the sexes. Adult female mice produce higher levels of T helper 1 (T H 1)­type cytokines (for example, IFNγ) than males, at least following parasitic infections, such as Leishmania major and Plasmodium chabaudi ,  in  which females are better protected 30 . Polyclonal activation of human PBMCs with the mito­ gen phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) results in higher pro­ duction of T H 2­type cytokines, including IL­4 and IL­10 in female PBMCs than in male PBMCs 31 . The T H 1-TH 2 dichotomy in males and females may not always hold true in humans. Naive CD4  T cells from human females + preferentially produce IFNγ upon stimulation, whereas naive T cells from males produce more IL­17 (REF. 32) . Expression of IL­17A is higher in males 29 or females 28 , depending on the stimulation and purity of the T cell population. Mouse studies investigating sex differences in regulatory T (T reg ) cells describe contradictory results

regarding organ­specific T reg cell frequencies in various diseases, whereas human studies suggest there are higher numbers of T reg cells in healthy adult males compared with females 33 .

Regardless of age, females tend to show greater anti­ body responses than males, higher basal immunoglobu­ lin levels and higher B cell numbers 19,34,35 . Global analysis of B cell gene­expression signatures reveal that the majority of genes differentially expressed between the sexes are significantly upregulated in B cells from females compared with males 36 .

## Genetic mediators

Sex chromosomes. Many genes on the X chromosome regulate immune function and play an important role in modulating sex differences in the development of immune­related diseases 37 (BOX 2) . These genes code for proteins ranging from PRRs (for example, TLR7 and TLR8 )  to  cytokine  receptors  (for  example, IL2RG and IL13RA2 ) and transcriptional factors (for example, FOXP3 ). The Y chromosome also contains numerous regulatory response genes, and Y chromosome poly­ morphisms affect sex­dependent susceptibility to viral infection 38 .

The SRY gene on the Y chromosome causes testes formation and testosterone synthesis, leading to male phenotypic development, whereas the absence of SRY expression results in ovaries and female­typic develop­ ment. The 'four core genotypes' (FCG) mouse model was developed to investigate the impact of sex chromosomes (XX versus XY) and gonadal type (testes versus ovaries) on phenotypes. Deletion of Sry from the Y chromosome results in XY minus (XY ) FCG mice that are gonadal -females (that is, with ovaries). Insertion of the Sry trans­ gene onto an autosome in XX or XY  FCG mice (XX -Sry and XY Sry ) results in gonadal males (that is, with testes). Depletion of gonadal steroids by gonadectomy of FCG mice unmasks effects of sex chromosome complement on multiple functions, including susceptibility to auto­ immune disease and viral infection 39,40 . In experi  mental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE) and lupus, for example, the presence of the XX sex chromosome complement worsens disease progression, relative to that in the XY mice, and results in decreased production of IL­4, IL­5 and IL­13, but increased IL­13Rα2 expression on DCs 39 .

Klinefelter and Turner syndromes are two inheri­ ted disorders that further exemplify the effects of the X chromo  some on immunity. Klinefelter syndrome occurs when males have an extra X chromosome, result­ ing in low testosterone, increased gonadotrophins and elevated oestrogen concentrations. Immunologically, men with Klinefelter syndrome respond more like females, with higher immunoglobulin concentrations, CD4 +  T cell numbers, CD4/CD8 T cell ratios and B cell numbers than XY male controls 41 . The immunologi  cal effects of Klinefelter syndrome are reversed by testoster­ one therapy 41 , illustrating that both sex chromo  somes and sex steroids regulate immune responses. By con­ trast, women with Turner syndrome (that is, who have only one X chromosome (X0) or have major X chromo­ some deletions 42 ) have lower IgG and IgM   levels and

lower T cell and B cell levels compared to XX females 43 . Both patients with Klinefelter syndrome and patients with Turner syndrome show increased development of  autoimmune disease, pointing to a major role for the X   chromosome in influencing susceptibility to autoimmunity 42 .

MicroRNAs and long non-coding RNA. Much of the mammalian genome encodes for transcripts that are not translated into proteins, including microRNAs (  mi  RNAs) and long non­coding RNAs (lncRNAs). Despite the fact that male and female invertebrates and higher organisms differentially express mi  RNAs, few studies have addressed the role of mi  RNAs in sex dif­ ferences in diseases 44 . The X chromosome contains 10% of the ~800 mi  RNAs in the human genome, whereas the Y chromosome only contains 2 mi  RNAs 45 . MiRNAs

R

- including miRNA­18 and miRNA­19, which are encoded on the X chromosome - play a role in sex dif­ ferences in immune responses 46 . MicroRNA expression can be under sex hormone control 47 . The high density of mi  RNAs on the X chromosome means that females may express more owing to incomplete X inactivation (BOX 2) , further contributing to sex differences in susceptibility to certain diseases.

The lncRNAs play a vital role in the regulation of multiple immunological processes, including transcrip­ tional regulation of innate and adaptive immunity 48 and as a catalyst of X inactivation in a manner that has been shown to be sex­differential 49 .

Genetic polymorphisms. Polymorphisms or variabil­ ity in sex chromosome and autosomal genes encoding immunological proteins can have sex­differential effects on immunity. For example, sex­based differences in HLA alleles and genes that encode for IL­4, IL­10 and the IL­12 receptor, have each been associated with differential antibody responses to vaccines against measles, mumps, hepa  titis A, tetanus and diphtheria in children and adults 11 . Whether sex­based differences in the expres­ sion of gene variants are caused by differential selection pressures acting on each sex, hormone­  dependent effects, or epigenetic mechanisms remain to be determined but, because these differences are apparent early in life and remain over the life course, genetic as opposed to hormonal mechanisms are likely to be involved 50 .

## Hormonal mediators

Oestradiol. Levels  of  oestrogen,  for  example, 17β­  oestradiol (E2), are variable during the menstrual cycle, high during pregnancy and low after menopause in females. ERs are expressed in various lymphoid tis­ sue cells, in lymphocytes, macrophages, and DCs. The two ER subtypes for classical oestrogen signalling, ERα and ERβ, exhibit differential expression among immune cell subsets; ERα is highly expressed in T cells and ERβ is upregulated in B cells 51 . Non­classical ER signalling also occurs in immune cells, enabling protein-protein inter­ actions between ERs and ERE­independent transcrip­ tion factors, including NF­κB, specific protein 1 (SP1) and activator protein 1 (AP­1) 52 . Differential effects of oestrogens on immune function reflect not only oestro­ gen concentration but also the density, distribution and type of ERs in immune cells.

E2 affects many aspects of innate immunity (TABLE 3) , including the functional activity of innate immune cells that influence downstream adaptive immune responses. Treatment of either humans or mice with E2 increases neutrophil numbers in the blood and lungs, respec­ tively 53,54 . Exposure of NK cells to E2 in vitro enhances production of IFNγ and overall cytotoxicity 55 , but also downregulates expression of NK cell surface activation markers and FAS ligand (FASL), and reduces their secre­ tion of granzyme B in mice 56 . E2 has bipotential effects on monocytes and macrophages derived from humans, with low doses enhancing the production of pro­ inflammatory cytokines (such as IL­1, IL­6 and TNF) and high concentrations reducing their production of

Nature Reviews   Immunology | Figure 1 | Changes in immune responses in human males and females over the life course. Multiple immunological factors vary between the sexes throughout the course of life. For certain factors (for example, pro-inflammatory responses), the sex differences change at puberty and then wane in later life suggesting hormonal effects. For other factors the sex difference remains constant from birth to old age (for example, higher numbers of CD4 + T cells and CD4/CD8 T cell ratios in females). The paucity of studies in this area is notable, particularly in utero sex differences in which results are conflicting. IL-10, interleukin-10; NK, natural killer; T reg , regulatory T.

these cytokines 57 . E2 also enhances the expression of PRRs, including TLR4, on the surface of peritoneal macrophages in rodents 58 . In vitro E2 exposure facili­ tates the differentiation of bone marrow precursor cells into functional CD11c  DCs + 59 and increases the synth­ esis of CXCL8 and CC­chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) by immature DCs in mice 60 . Treatment of ovariectomized mice with physiological doses of E2 increases production of pro­  inflammatory cytokines by CD11c  DCs + 61,62 . E2 acts primarily through ERα, not ERβ, to regulate DC differentiation in mice 59 . In response to granulocytemacrophage colony­stimulating factor (GM­CSF) in human monocyte cell systems, E2 promotes differenti­ ation of   monocytes into inflammatory DCs, which show increased production of IFNα and pro­inflammatory cytokines, increased TLR7 and TLR9 signalling, and greater internalization and presentation of antigen to naive T cells 63 . This is most likely to contribute to the greater type I IFN activity seen in immune cells from females than in males.

E2  enhances  both  cell­mediated  and  humoral immune responses (TABLE 3) . Generally, low E2 concen­ trations promote T H 1­type responses and cell­mediated immunity, whereas high E2 concentrations augment TH2­type responses and humoral immunity in diverse species and cell culture systems 64 . Binding of E2 to ERs

increases Ifng transcription via EREs in the promoter region of the Ifng gene 65 . Low dose E2 also upregulates mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK), T­bet, and select   mi  RNAs to increase production of IFNγ by T cells, an effect reversed by the ER antagonist ICI 182,780 in murine studies 66-68 .  E2  regulates pro­inflammatory responses that are transcriptionally mediated by NF­κB through a negative   feedback and/or transrepressive nteraction with NF­κB i 64 .

Exogenous E2 enhances the expansion of T reg cell populations in mice and healthy women and, in vitro , E2 increases the number of T reg cells generated from PBMCs 69,70 . Treatment of mice with high doses of E2 decreases IL­17 production by T H 17 cells 71 , whereas ovariectomy of female mice increases T H 17 cell num­ bers and IL­17 production 72 . E2 at physiological con­ centrations also stimulates humoral responses to infection 73 . Numbers of antibody­secreting cells and antibody levels are highest before ovulation in females 73 . Oestrogen also induces somatic hypermutation and class switch recombination in B cells via the upregulation of ctivation­induced deaminase a 74 .

Progesterone. Progesterone (P4) is produced by the cor­ pus luteum during the menstrual cycle and at high levels by the placenta during pregnancy. P4 signals through

## Box 2 | Sex chromosomes and X inactivation

In humans, sex chromosomes are heterologous in males (XY) and homologous in females (XX). The human Y chromosome contains approximately 100 genes, including SRY , which encodes for the testis determining factor, and regulatory genes that may be important for immune responses in autoimmune and infectious diseases 38,144 . The human X chromosome contains over 1,100 annotated genes, representing approximately 5% of the human genome, and includes a significant number of immune related genes, such as interleukin 2 (IL-2) receptorγ chain, IL-3 receptorα chain, IL-13 receptorα chains, Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7), TLR8, GATA1, IL-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1), CD40 ligand and FOXP3 (REF. 145) . Several crucial transcriptional and translational control effectors, that function downstream of activated cytokine receptors, are encoded on the X chromosome. The implications are that X-linked genes are determinants of sex differential immune responses. For genes on the X chromosome, outside of the pseudoautosomal regions, one copy has to be silenced to ensure only a single copy functions in each sex. Inactivation is initiated by the X-inactive specific transcript ( XIST ) gene. Approximately 15% of X genes in humans and 3% in mice escape X inactivation and are found in higher copy number in females than males. For X-linked genes that are inactivated in females, the random process of inactivation of copies derived from the maternal or paternal X chromosome results in a mosaic in females, but not in males. Genomic imprinting is an epigenetic mechanism that is responsible for an imbalance in expression of maternal and paternal inherited genes according to the parent-of-origin. It varies in different tissues and at different developmental stages. In mice, the expression levels of certain imprinted genes vary between the sexes 146 . In addition to sex differences in transcription, there are also sex differences in post-transcriptional mechanisms.

the progesterone receptor and to a lesser extent, through glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid receptors. proges­ terone receptors are present on many different immune cell  types,  including  NK  cells,  macrophages, DCs, and T cells 75 .

P4 has broad anti­inflammatory effects (TABLE 3) . P4­exposed macrophages and DCs have a lower state of activation and produce lower amounts of IL­1β and TNF compared with untreated cells 76,77 . P4 treatment of mouse bone marrow­derived macrophages induces the expression of FIZZ1 and YM1, both markers of alternatively activated macrophages, and reduces pro­ duction of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and nitric oxide (NO) 78 . TLR and the NF­κB pathways can also be antagonized by the action of P4 (REFS 76,79) . Treatment of human NK cells with P4 reduces activation and production of IFNγ via caspase­dependent apopto­ sis 80 . Progesterone can promote skewing of CD4  T cell + responses from T H 1­type towards T H 2­type responses, as characterized by increased IL­4, IL­5, and IL­10 pro­ duction 81 . When cord blood cells are treated with P4, the percentage of FOXP3  T + reg cells increases, while T H 17 cell frequencies decline 82 . Whether P4 contributes directly to male-female differences in the skewing of CD4  T cell + responses requires consideration.

Androgens. Androgens, including dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and testosterone, occur in higher concentrations in post­pubertal men than women, and they generally suppress immune cell activity 30 (TABLE 3) . Exposure to testosterone in vivo reduces NK cell activity in mice 83 . Surface expression of TLR4 on macrophages is reduced by exposure to testosterone both in vitro and in vivo , driv­ ing increased susceptibility to endotoxic shock   following gonadectomy of male mice 18 . Testosterone reduces the

R

synthesis of TNF, iNOS and NO by macrophages 84 . Testosterone and DHT increase IL­10 and transforming growth factor­β (TGFβ) synthesis, causing increased anti­inflammatory responses via androgen receptor sig­ nalling 84,85 . Androgens also suppress pro­  inflammatory responses by reducing extracellular signal­regulated kinases and leukotriene formation in neutrophils 86 .

Men with androgen deficiencies have higher concen­ trations of inflammatory cytokines (for example, IL­1β, IL­2 and TNF), antibody titers and CD4/CD8 T cell ratios than men with normal testosterone levels 87-90 . Men treated with a gonadotropin­releasing hormone antago­ nist, which significantly reduces testosterone levels, have lower peripheral blood T reg cell counts and higher NK cell counts compared with placebo­treated men or men treated with both the gonadotropin­releasing hormone antagonist and exogenous testosterone 91 . Castrated male mice have higher numbers of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells 92 and higher numbers of macrophages and antigen­  specific CD8 +  T cells following viral infection than gonadally intact males 93 . Treatment of female mice with   testosterone inhibits secretion of IFNγ by natural killer T cells 94 .

The immunosuppressive effects of androgens may reflect the inhibitory effects of androgen receptor sig­ nalling on transcriptional factors for pro­inflammatory and antiviral cytokines 95 . Androgens also enhance the expression of peroxisome proliferator­activated recep­ tor­α (PPARα) in T cells by engaging AREs in the pro­ moter of the PPARα gene, which repress the activity of NF­κB and JUN to control inflammation 96 . Taken together, these studies illustrate that sex steroids are potent regulators of immune responses.

## Environmental mediators

Although genes and hormones are the most well charac  terized mediators of sex differences in immune responses, environmental factors can also modulate the functioning of the immune system differentially between males and females.

Nutrition. The nutritional environment of the fetus can have differential effects depending on its sex. Maternal micronutrient supplementation during pregnancy in a Gambian placebo­controlled study reported sex differ­ ences in CpG methylation of genes involved in immu­ nity and defence against infection (for example, genes encoding CD4, defensins and genes associated with IFN signalling), and female fetuses were most affected in the supplemented group whereas males were most affected in the non­supplemented group 97 . The study demonstrates that sex­differential developmental trajectories com­ mence in utero and persist to 9 months of age, indicating long­term epigenetic reprogramming in relation to nutri­ tion during pregnancy. A high­fat diet also enhances, whereas prenatal exposure to famine reduces, placental gene expression and DNA hypomethylation to a greater extent in female than in male fetuses 98 . Several studies also suggest that the immunomodulatory effects of breast milk may benefit infant females more than males, with breastfeeding reducing the risk of neonatal respiratory tract infection in female but not male infants 99 .

Androgens (including testosterone), oestrogens (including 17 β -oestradiol), and progesterone can have distinct and overlapping effects on the recruitment and activity of diverse immune cell populations in humans, rodents and primary cell culture systems. Generally, testosterone and progesterone are anti-inflammatory, suppressing several of the immune responses necessary for inflammation. Oestradiol has bipotential effects: low concentrations of oestradiol (for example, during the follicular stage of the reproductive cycle) can be pro-inflammatory, whereas high concentrations of oestradiol (for example, during the luteal phase of the reproductive cycle or during pregnancy) can be anti-inflammatory.

There is accumulating evidence that micronutri­ ents act differently in males and females. Perinatal and postnatal vitamin B, vitamin C and vitamin E supple­ ments are associated with a 32% reduction in mortality among females but not males in a randomized placebo­ controlled trial of Tanzanian mothers infected with HIV 100 . Studies conducted in African and Asian infants suggest that females may benefit more than males from maternal micronutrient supplements 101,102 . Vitamin A supplementation (VAS), given with measles vaccination to children between 6 and 23 months of age, have sex dif­ ferential immunomodulatory effects compared to a pla­ cebo, including decreased leukocyte subsets in males, and increased numbers of leukocytes and IFNγ   production by ex vivo stimulated cells from females 103 .

Microbiota. A perturbed microbiome - referred to as dysbiosis - contributes to various disease processes including inflammation and diabetes. Sex influences the host microbiome outside of the reproductive tract, which probably involves sex steroid hormones 104,105 . During early life, sex does not influence the micro  biome composition. Deep sequencing of colonic contents in pre­pubescent mice report no sex difference in bacterial community composition, suggesting that sex does not influence the microbiome in this age group 106 . A num­ ber of mouse studies, however, show sex differences in host gene expression in the gastrointestinal tract before puberty, demonstrating that sex­specific gene regulation occurs even in the absence of high levels of circulating sex hormones 106 . After puberty, female rodents have lower frequencies of Bacteroidetes than males 104,105 .

In a mouse model of spontaneous type 1 diabetes, adoptive transfer of gut commensals from male mice into females resulted in systemic hormonal changes and protected against disease 104,105 . Similar to what is seen in mice, the human female microbiome is less abundant in Bacteroidetes spp. than males 107 . A study specifically analysing for a sex-diet interaction in diverse vertebrate species including fish, mice, and humans confirmed that diet has sex­specific effects on the gut microbiome in two species of fish, affects Fusobacteria spp. levels in humans, but does not seem to affect the microbiome in laboratory mice 108 . The lack of effect of diet on sex dif­ ference in the gut microbiome in laboratory mice may reflect the highly simplified diets they are fed and the artificial environment in which they are maintained 109 . Whether sex differences in the effects of diet on the gut microbiome in humans contributes to sex differences in diseases associated with dysbiosis, such as inflamma­ tory bowel disease requires consideration. These data also imply that therapeutic approaches to treat diseases associated with dysbiosis may need to be different for males and females.

## Effects of age and reproductive status

The age and reproductive status of an individual are also important determinants of sex­related differences in immune responses (FIG. 1) . In the following section, we highlight some of the key immunological differences that are seen between the sexes at different stages of life.

In utero. Adverse fetal conditions may cause epi­ genetic adaptations leading to altered gene activity that can persist throughout life, including immunologi­ cal programming 110 . Sex­differential developmental programming in utero results in sex differences in the local milieu and immune system development. Female fetuses have greater adaptability to intra­uterine stress than males. The placentas from premature (that is, born at &lt;32 weeks gestation) male fetuses tend to be more chronically inflamed compared with those from female fetuses 111 , providing females survival benefits from bet­ ter cardiovascular stability and lower levels of circulat­ ing cytokines. Human male testes produce androgens from 10 weeks of gestation 112 , leading to early develop­ ment of androgen­dependent sex differences in immu­ nity. Male neonates have higher cord blood IgE levels than females 113 , a fetal product that may predict the development of atopy.

Birth to 5 years of age. At birth the fetus transitions from the placenta to the outside environment and is bombarded with new antigens. Multiple studies have investigated neonatal immunity using cord blood sam­ ples due to the availability of large blood volumes, but few have specifically looked for sex differences. Cord blood mononuclear cell reactivity to TLR agonists in full term infants and pre­term infants that were born at &lt;33 weeks of gestation is not affected by sex in either group 114 . However, human male infants have higher monocyte and basophil counts compared to females up until 13 months of age, at least in high pathogen bur­ den settings 115 . NK cell frequencies are higher in male than female children 25 . Infant males have greater pro­ inflammatory responses than females following stimu­ lation with either LPS or mitogens 116 , all suggesting that males develop more robust innate immunity compared with females in early life .

Female cord blood contains higher numbers of CD4 +  T cells, higher CD4/CD8 T cell ratios and lower numbers of CD8 + T cells and NK cells than cord blood from males, and these differences persist throughout childhood. By contrast, B cell numbers are compar­ able in male and female children 25,26 . The existence of these sex differences before puberty is often interpreted as evidence for genetic differences between the sexes. Neonatal castration experiments in rodents illustrate that the neonatal sex steroid milieu influences thymic development causing sex differences in the peripheral T cell compartment, including lower CD4/CD8 T cell ratios and higher NK T cell and CD4 CD25 + + FOXP3 + Treg cell numbers in neonatal males 117 . By contrast, there are no sex differences in human T reg cell frequencies in Australian infants from birth to one year of age 118 . Nigerian female children (aged 5-12 years) have lower IgA levels, but equivalent IgG and IgM levels, compared with males 119 .

Puberty. The multiple effects of sex steroids on immune cells play a prominent role in sex differences in inflam­ matory status during puberty. Although infant males may produce higher inflammatory responses than

females, after puberty inflammatory responses are con­ sistently higher in females than in males 120 . Females continue to have higher CD4  T cell counts and higher + CD4/CD8 T cell ratios than males throughout adult­ hood 27,121 ,  whereas males have higher numbers of Treg cells 33 . Gene expression studies in mice show that post­pubertal females show increased expression of genes associated with the adaptive immune response (for example, immunoglobulin and B cell receptor genes), whereas males show increased expression of genes that are associated with innate responses (for example, serum amyloid A, haptoglobin and plasminogen activator inhibitor 2 as well as Ccl9 and Ccr1) 122 .

Because sex steroids profoundly affect the immune response, it is not surprising that hormonal changes dur­ ing the female menstrual cycle underlie cyclical changes in immune function and exacerbation of diseases, with pronounced fluctuations in immune cell numbers and function occurring over the menstrual cycle, including increased numbers of T reg cells when E2 concentrations are highest before ovulation 123 .

Reproductive senescence. Women, worldwide, have a longer lifespan than males, with biological factors, including changes in sex steroid concentrations and X chromosome diploidy, having a significant role 124 . With age, concentrations of sex steroids decline rapidly for females and more gradually for males, paralleling a progressive functional decline in the immune system of both sexes 125 . One of the most well characterized attrib­ utes of an ageing immune system is an aberrant chronic low­grade pro­inflammatory state, thought to occur to a greater extent in females than males 35 . NK cell num­ bers increase with age, with the kinetics of this rise being greater for females than males 126 . Female menopause is associated with a decline in certain lymphocyte subsets, but elderly males experience a more rapid decline in numbers of B cells and various CD4  T cell subsets and + show lower levels of T cell proliferation than females, along with a more modest increase in CD4 + memory T cells following antigen re­exposure 34,126 . A popula­ tion of B cells referred to as 'age­associated B cells' has been linked with the development of autoimmune dis­ eases in mice and humans, and these cells are found in higher   frequencies in aged female mice than in aged male mice 127 .

## Sex differences in the pathogenesis of diseases

Autoimmune diseases. Women represent ~80% of all cases of autoimmunity in the US 128 . Sex differences in the incidence of autoimmunity are most pronounced for Sjögren syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, thy­ roid diseases (such as Hashimoto thyroiditis and Graves disease), scleroderma, and myasthenia gravis, with significantly more women afflicted than men (FIG. 2) . Although less common, there are some autoimmune diseases, including myocarditis and idiopathic pulmo­ nary fibrosis, that show greater incidence in males than females, which is hypothesized to reflect higher T H 1 cell responses to self antigens during the acute phase of these autoimmune diseases 129 .

Nature Reviews   Immunology | Figure 2 | Sex bias in infectious diseases, inflammatory diseases and cancers. At the extremes, males and females show robust differences in their susceptibility to autoimmunity and cancers. Generally, females show increased susceptibility to autoimmune disease development and males show increased susceptibility to non reproductive malignant cancers. Although at a less pronounced magnitude, sex differences are also seen in susceptibility to various infectious diseases. Reproductive status, including pregnancy, as well as immune-mediated pathology contributes to female-biased infectious diseases, whereas pathogen-associated damage, including delayed clearance, is associated with male-biased infectious diseases.

Animal models, including the experimental auto­ immune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model of multiple sclerosis and the nonobese diabetic (NOD) mouse model of spontaneous type 1 diabetes, have been used to characterize the immunological and hormonal causes of sex differences in autoimmune diseases. The incidence and severity of autoimmune disease in NOD mice and in EAE models is higher in female than in male mice. Castration of males increases, whereas ovariectomy of females decreases, the incidence of autoimmune diseases in mouse models 130 . In EAE mice and in PBMCs from patients with multiple sclerosis, females show greater activation of T H 1 cells and increased levels of IFNγ production, whereas males exhibit greater T H 17 cell responses owing to androgen receptor regulation of PPARα expression in T cells 32 . In female mice with EAE and women with severe forms of multiple sclerosis, administration of high doses of oestrogens suppress cell­mediated immune responses and relieves disease symptoms 130,131 . In men with multiple sclerosis, topi­ cal treatment with a gel containing testosterone slows brain atrophy and shifts peripheral immune responses by reducing the numbers of CD4 + T cells and PBMC production of IL­2 and increasing numbers of NK cells and PBMC production of TGFβ 132 Thus, administration of hormone supplements to patients with autoimmune diseases may have novel therapeutic applications.

Malignancy. Sex is an important factor in the patho­ genesis and prognosis of many cancers that occur out­ side of the reproductive tract (FIG. 2) . For the majority of cancers throughout life, the risk of malignancy is higher for males 133 . Males have an almost twofold greater risk of mortality from all malignant cancers than do females 134 , with sex­differential outcomes being greatest for larynx,

oesophagus, bladder and lung cancers 134 . This male­ biased mortality is hypothesized to reflect differences in cancer aetiology 134 , including sex differences in viral infection, immune function, hormonal regulation, gene expression, sex chromosome complement, oxidative damage, autophagy, or a combination of factors 134,135 . Even treatments for cancers show sex­specific out­ comes. Immune checkpoint inhibitors are revolution­ izing cancer treatment, and some treatments, including programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PDL1)­specific monoclonal antibodies, appear to be more efficacious in female patients compared with male patients with melanoma 136 . The sex­differential effects of cancer chemotherapies with immunomodulatory properties and cancer vaccines require dedicated research.

Infectious diseases. The sexes differ in the severity, preva  lence, and pathogenesis of infections caused by viruses, bacteria, parasites and fungi, with males gener­ ally more susceptible to these infections than females 137 (FIG. 2) . These differences are observed for infectious diseases acquired via multiple routes such as person­ to­  person, vector­borne, blood­borne, and food and water borne 124 , with sex differences in immunity playing a major role 138 . Newborn males are more vulnerable to infections and death than females 139 . In several devel­ oping countries, school­age male children have higher rates of protozoan infections (such as, malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum , visceral leishmaniasis and Entameba histolytica induced amoebic liver abscess), trematode infections (such as, schistosomiasis caused by Schistosoma mansoni ) and nematode infections (such as those with Necator americanus , Toxocara spp. and Wuchereria bancrofti ) 140 . Among adults, untreated HIV­1­infected women have greater CD8 + T cell acti­ vation than men when adjusted for viral load and over 40% less circulating HIV RNA than men; however, when matched with men by HIV RNA load, woman have a 1.6­fold higher risk of developing AIDS 141 . Although exposure to influenza A viruses is often higher in men, fatality following exposure to patho­ genic influenza A viruses is higher in women; by con­ trast, the prevalence of serum hepatitis B virus (HBV) surface antigen, HBV DNA titers and development of hepatocellular carcinoma is higher in men than women. In most countries, tuberculosis notification is twice as high for men than women. Clinical cryptococcosis is 10 times higher for immunocompromised men than women. Heightened immunity to pathogens among females contributes to lower intensity (that is viral load within an individual) and prevalence (that is number of infected individuals within a population) of many infec­ tions for females than males, but it may increase dis­ ease symptoms and severity among females compared with males 137 .

Vaccines. Sex differences have been described in immu­ nity to multiple vaccines, including both inactivated vaccines (such as vaccines against brucellosis, diph­ theria, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, herpes simplex virus­2 infection (genital herpes), influenza, meningococcal

meningitis, pneumococcal disease (using pneumo­ coccal polysaccharide), rabies and tetanus) and live vaccines (such as those against measles, rubella, small­ pox, Venezuelan equine encephalitis, and yellow fever), in both children and adults 142 . The biological differ­ ences between the sexes is a major source of variation in the immune response to vaccination 11,124 (TABLE 4) .

Antibody responses to bacterial and viral vaccines are often higher in females than males (TABLE 4) . This could mean that the effective vaccine dose is lower for females than for males. For example, in dose response studies with the inactivated influenza vaccine, human females vaccinated with a half dose influenza vaccine achieved equivalent antibody titres to males vaccinated with full dose vaccine 143 . Females consistently report more frequent and severe local and systemic   reactions to viral and bacterial vaccines than males, at least among young and ageing adults 11,124,142 , reflecting either a reporting bias or greater inflammatory responses among females than males 11 . Whether sex differences in immune responses to vaccines are caused by genetic, hormonal and environmental factors, or a combination, requires consideration.

## Conclusions and perspective

The basis for personalized medicine is that unique aspects of our biology, including our immune responses, will define novel targets for more effective prevention and treatment of immune­related diseases. In this Review, we provide evidence that sex is one variable that influences innate and adaptive immune responses, resulting in sex­specific outcomes from infectious and autoimmune diseases, malignancies, and vaccines. If the long­term goal of personalizing treatments for immune­mediated diseases is effective treatment for all individuals, then will we ultimately treat males and females differently in an effort to protect them equally? Future studies must identify the precise factors medi­ ating sex differences in the immune responses, know­ ing that this will probably reflect complex interactions among hormones, genes and our environment (both biotic and abiotic). Sex­based differences in the activ­ ity of the innate and adaptive immune responses likely have evolved through a process of convergent evolution, in which the fundamental mechanisms that under­ lie increased survival and reproductive success have sex­specific effects on immune function.
