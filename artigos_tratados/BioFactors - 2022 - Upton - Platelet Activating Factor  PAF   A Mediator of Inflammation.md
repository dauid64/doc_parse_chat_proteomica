## Abstract

Platelet-activating factor (PAF) is a phospholipid-derived mediator with an established role in multiple inflammatory states. PAF is synthesized and secreted by multiple cell types and is then rapidly hydrolyzed and degraded to an inactive metabolite, lyso-PAF, by the enzyme PAF acetylhydrolase. In addition to its role in platelet aggregation and activation, PAF contributes to allergic and nonallergic inflammatory diseases such as anaphylaxis, sepsis, cardiovascular disease, neurological disease, and malignancy as demonstrated in multiple animal models and, increasingly, in human disease states. Recent research has demonstrated the importance of the PAF pathway in multiple conditions including the prediction of severe pediatric anaphylaxis, effects on blood -brain barrier permeability, effects on reproduction, ocular diseases, and further understanding of its role in cardiovascular risk. Investigation of PAF as both a biomarker and a therapeutic target continues because of the need for directed management of inflammation. Collectively, studies have shown that therapies focused on the PAF pathway have the potential to provide targeted and effective treatments for multiple inflammatory conditions.

## 1 | INTRODUCTION, HISTORICAL ASPECTS, AND MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR BIOLOGY OF PAF, PAF-AH, AND PAF-R

Five decades ago, while studying leukocyte-dependent histamine release from rabbit platelets, Benveniste and colleagues found that IgE-sensitized basophils reexposed to the same antigen released a phospholipid that caused aggregation of platelets and release of their active

amines. 1 The researchers realized that this compound, which they termed platelet-activating factor (PAF), is involved in immediate hypersensitivity-type allergic reactions and also contributes to various inflammatory processes. The identification of a similar human PAF 2,3 and the appreciation that PAF is involved in many pathological processes led to a surge of studies into the chemical, molecular, and cellular biology of PAF, with more than 14,000 PubMed publications since 1982.

PAF is a glycerophosphocholine (GPC) with a molecular weight of 1100 kDa. The ether-linked side chain of PAF can vary, with the 16:0 moiety being the most prominent and potent, while the 18:0-, 17:0-, and 18:1-containing molecules demonstrating significantly reduced biological activity. PAF is produced by two

distinct pathways. 4 The de novo pathway produces constitutive low levels of PAF, while the majority of PAF is rapidly synthesized in response to specific stimuli via the remodeling pathway. The remodeling pathway involves hydrolysis of long chain fatty acids esterified at the sn -2 position in the glycerol backbone followed by acetylation using acetyl-CoA to produce a bioactive PAF. 5 The enzymatic production of PAF is tightly regulated and is limited by substrate and acetyl-CoA availability. PAF exerts its biological effects at high-picomolar/low-nanomolar concentrations. The typical serum concentration of PAF in healthy individuals is generally less than 400 pg/ml. 6 Additional PAF-like agonists have been identified that can elicit similar biological effects, albeit at much higher concentrations. These agonists can be formed in a nonenzymatic process in response to reactive oxygen species via direct attack of free radicals on the sn2 long-chained unsaturated fatty acid of GPC. 7 PAF can be produced by a variety of cells including endothelial cells, platelets, macrophages, monocytes, neutrophils and eosinophils, fibroblasts, and even cardiac muscle cells. 8 Once formed, PAF can act as an autocoid upon the cell itself, on neighboring cells or away from the producing cells. In the circulation, PAF was shown to have a short biological halflife, ranging from 3 -13 min, often in reverse correlation with PAF acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH) activity. 8 Recent studies also suggest that subcellular microvesicle particles might also contain PAF or PAF-agonist activity thereby extending the biological half-life and activity of PAF. 9

PAF acetylhydrolases (PAF-AHs), a family of Ca 2 + -independent lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2, are the primary regulators of PAF and PAF-agonists. PAFAHs can hydrolyze PAF to a biologically inactive form, lyso-PAF. Three unique PAF-AH isoforms have been identified, including a secreted form (PAF-AH) and two that are intracellular (PAF-AH Ib and PAF-AH II). These PAF-AHs show different biochemical characteristics and molecular structures. PAF-AH and PAF-AH II are not exclusive to PAF and can also hydrolyze oxidatively fragmented phospholipids with potent biological activities, while PAF-AH Ib displays high specificity for the sn -2 acetyl group of GPC. 10 PAF-AH (EC 3.1.1.47) was the first to be described 11 and is a monomeric polypeptide with a molecular weight of 45 kDa produced primarily in the liver and by hematopoietic cells such as macrophages and mast cells. Accordingly, PAF-AH concentrations are particularly high in tissues rich in macrophages, such as the thymus, tonsils, placenta, and liver. 12 PAF-AH II has a molecular weight of 40 kDa, shares 41% sequence identity with plasma PAF-AH, and is highly expressed in liver and kidney. 13 PAF-AH Ib has been found in the brain and consists of two catalytic subunits and a regulatory 45-kDa subunit. 14 In human plasma, PAF-AH circulates in a complex tightly associated with both high- and low-

density lipoprotein, 15,16 whereas in rodents' plasma PAFAH is mainly bound to HDL, 17 emphasizing some of the differences between species. The concentrations of PAFAH in the plasma of healthy adult individuals is &gt;20 nmol/ml/min and usually in the range of up to 34.9 ± 10.6 nmol/ml/min, 6 while in children it might be lower. 18

Changes to PAF-AH plasma activity have been associated with diverse pathological conditions, although such data should be interpreted with caution as the activity is sensitive to oxidation, and LDL availability might also affect the amount of PAF-AH in the plasma. Enhanced synthesis and secretion of plasma PAF-AH was identified during differentiation of monocytes to macrophages, possibly reflecting a mechanism intended to control PAF production during acute inflammation. Indeed, an increase, albeit modest, in plasma PAF-AH activity was reported in various pathologic conditions, including ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, familial HDL deficiency, chronic cholestasis, diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, essential hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, and even habitual cigarette smokers. 10 In these conditions, the elevated PAF-AH activity might reflect PAF ability to stimulate production of PAF-AH expression by the liver and immune cells.

Decreased or even loss of PAF-AH function due to inactivating mutations in the PAF-AH gene have been reported in several populations. A Val279Phe loss-offunction mutation in the PAF-AH gene, which affects an area that is near the active site and critical for protein folding was identified in a heterozygous or homozygous state at a frequency of 27% and 4%, respectively in healthy Japanese individuals. 19 This mutation was also reported in Kirghiz and Turkish populations, possibly suggesting a common ancestral origin. 20 Several studies have identified a significant association between the PAF-AH Val279Phe mutation and cerebral-vascular accident, nonfamilial cardiomyopathy, atherosclerotic occlusive disease, and myocardial infarcts. 10 Additional mutations have been reported in different populations at lower frequency or with a milder impact on PAF-AH activity, however their biological significance is not clear, as the minimum amount of enzyme required for regulating PAF has not yet been established. 21 Changes in PAFAH activity have also been associated with acute events such as allergic responses 22 and fatal anaphylaxis. 23

PAF exert its effects by binding to the PAF receptor (PAF-R). PAF-R is expressed by many cells and in many tissues. These include T lymphocytes, monocytes and macrophages, platelets, tracheal epithelium, vascular endothelium of different caliber arteries and veins, myometrium, spleen, kidney, lung alveolar wall, liver, small intestine, heart, skeletal and smooth muscle, brain microgalia and neurons. 24,25 PAF-R stimulation of PAF-R leads

to complex intracellular signaling network, primarily through activation of G-proteins that possess intrinsic GTPase activity. The activated G proteins, in turn, activate polyphosphoinositide turnover leading to the generation of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate and diacylglycerol, mobilization of intracellular Ca + 2 , increase in cAMP and activation of protein kinases. PAF-R-associated G-protein activation also leads to the activation of cytoplasmic PLA2 with subsequent cleavage of arachidonic acid and the formation of leukotrienes, prostaglandins, and thromboxane. More recently, activation of additional kinases and phospholipases following PAF-R activation was also demonstrated. For instance, PAF-R activation has been shown to activate mitogen-activated protein kinase, PI 3-kinases, G-protein receptor kinase as well as tyrosine kinases such as SRC, JAK2, STAT3, and FAK. 26 Stimulation of the PAF-R was also shown to induce production of nitric oxide, another important immune modulator. 27 Of particular interest, PAF-R is also a potent stimulus for enzymatic PAF synthesis, suggesting a positive-feedback propagating system. Therefore, PAF-R expression and function must be tightly regulated. In humans, there are two unique PAF-R transcripts controlled by distinct promoters. 25 The first PAF-R transcript is found ubiquitously but is expressed predominantly in leukocytes, eosinophils, monocytes, and macrophages. The second transcript is found in the heart, lung, spleen, kidney, and skin epithelial cells but not in hematopoietic cells. PAF-R promoter 1 responds to inflammatory stimuli, whereas the expression of PAF-R transcript 2 is controlled by differentiation signals. In addition to cell and tissue specificity, PAF-R regulation is also achieved by homologous desensitization to repeated or sustained administration of exogenous PAF, possibly through phosphorylation of the carboxy terminus of the PAF-R. Other rapid PAF-R desensitization mechanisms include ligand induced internalization, or uncoupling from the G proteins which prevent subsequent intracellular signaling. Additionally, alterations in PAF-R expression in response to transient elevation of cAMP have been reported. In contrast, priming of macrophages with low levels of bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) can induce a threefold increase in PAF-R transcript levels, thereby amplifying subsequent response to stimulation, although the physiological relevance of this finding is still not clear. 25

The different expression of PAF-R and the G-proteins activated following receptor stimulation, account in part for the pleotropic biological effects observed following PAF-R engagement. In addition to platelet aggregation, PAF has been shown to induce changes in many immunemediated pathways. 28 Some of the effects of PAF included histamine release from basophils, activation and degranulation of mast cells, 29 chemotaxis of mast cells 30 and

eosinophils, 31 recruitment of neutrophils, 32 and production of IL-4 by B lymphocytes. 33 In the respiratory and cardiovascular systems, PAF can induce bronchial smooth muscle contraction and mucus secretion 34 as well as increase vascular and blood -brain barrier permeability. 35 PAF can also enhance the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells 36 and cause them to secrete prostaglandin, 37 relax the aorta, 27 reduce coronary blood flow, depress myocardial contractility, and induce arrhythmia. 38 The effects of PAF on the immune and vascular systems, as well as the composition of the extracellular matrix and microenvironment together with enhanced PAF-R expression might explain the intriguing finding that PAF can promote ovarian cancer progression. 39,40 It is important to note that despite the involvement of PAF in many immune and nonimmune physiological pathways, it has yet to be demonstrated as an independent cause of any significant pathological condition.

## 2 | ANIMAL DATA ON PAF, PAF-R KNOCKOUTS, TREATMENT WITH EXOGENOUS RECOMBINANT HUMAN PAF-AH, AND EFFECTS OF PAF RECEPTOR ANTAGONISTS

PAF is a highly potent phospholipid-derived mediator active at nanomolar concentrations. Its role in platelet aggregation and activation through release of vasoactive amines in the inflammatory response, resulting in increased vascular permeability, circulatory collapse, and decreased cardiac output (CO) has been well established in experimental models. PAF is produced and secreted by several types of cells, including mast cells, monocytes, tissue macrophages, platelets, eosinophils, endothelial cells, and neutrophils. PAF is rapidly hydrolyzed and degraded to an inactive metabolite, lyso-PAF, by the enzyme PAFAH, the activity of which has shown to correlate inversely with PAF levels and predispose to severe anaphylaxis. In addition to its role in anaphylaxis, PAF has also been implicated as a mediator in both allergic and nonallergic inflammatory diseases, including allergic rhinitis, allergic conjunctivitis, sepsis, atherosclerotic disease, and malignancy, in which PAF signaling has an established role. 23

Numerous studies have examined the biological actions of exogenous PAF in a variety of experimental models. Intradermal injection of PAF has been shown to elicit an acute inflammatory response in guinea pig skin and acute wheal and flare formation in human skin. 41 Neither indomethacin nor H1 antihistamines modified the proinflammatory effect. Intradermal injection showed a biphasic pattern with accumulation of neutrophils and mononuclear inflammatory cells in the injection site

followed by a later onset of erythema. 42 Plasma protein extravasation by PAF was potentiated by both PGE2 and a stable prostacyclin analogue, pointing to a potential for synergy with other inflammatory mediators. 43 In a rat model of ischemic bowel necrosis, LPS alone, or PAF at a low dose, caused ischemic intestinal necrosis when administered intra-aortically. 44 However, when these two compounds were given in combination, necrotizing lesions of the gastrointestinal tract developed consistently. The lesions showed marked morphologic similarity to human necrotizing enterocolitis. Thus, a different experimental model has demonstrated the potential for interaction, or indeed potentiation, of the action of PAF with other biologically active immunomodulators.

Hepatic cirrhosis was induced in rats by combined treatment with oral phenobarbital and inhaled carbon tetrachloride. Cirrhotic rats showed enhanced CO, decreased mean arterial pressure (MAP), and peripheral vascular resistance (PVR). Measurement of the levels of PAF in blood demonstrated significantly higher levels in cirrhotic (2.65 ± 0.39; n = 10) than in control rats (1.50 ± 0.57 ng/ml; n = 10; p &lt; 0.05). The intravenous injection of the PAF-R antagonist (PAF-RA) BN 52021 (5 mg/kg body weight) was measured in 10 control and 10 cirrhotic male Wistar rats, using a radioactive microsphere technique. BN 52021 induced no significant hemodynamic changes in control animals but significantly decreased CO with an increase in PVR in cirrhotic animals. 45 In a rat model of experimental bacterial peritonitis, male Wistar rats were injected intraperitoneally (ip) with 10 9 U Escherichia coli , leading to development of acute bacterial peritonitis. 46 The authors performed hemodynamic studies, with radiolabelled microspheres. Plasma PAF levels were measured in 10 control rats and 20 animals with experimental peritonitis. Rats injected with E coli . ( n = 13) displayed hyperdynamic circulation, with an increase in CO and a decrease in total peripheral resistance (TPR). These rats showed high endotoxin blood concentrations. Rats with high endotoxin blood levels showed higher PAF plasma levels than control rats or peritonitic rats with low endotoxin blood levels. 46

Hemodynamic responses following intravenous injection of PAF in anesthetized BALB/c mice showed a dosedependent decrease in TPR and increase in pulmonary vasoconstriction. 47 These effects much more pronounced than changes elicited by leukotriene C4, serotonin, histamine, and prostaglandin D2. Infusion of PAF intravenously in conscious Swiss mice showed dose-dependent lethality (15 -80 mcg/kg) which was potentiated by administration of the β -blocker, propranolol. 48 In contrast, dexamethasone exerted a dose-dependent protective effect, when mice were pretreated at least 4 h before administration of PAF. Exogenous PAF caused

hypotension, plasma extravasation, metabolic acidosis, and death in rats. Sprague -Dawley rats injected with PAF exhibited a dose-dependent increase in PVR, which was greater than changes induced by injection of LTC4 and PGD2. 47 Airway pressures and pulmonary vascular resistance were increased by PAF.

Hemodynamic alterations were assessed in rats using radiolabeled microspheres to assess CO, PVR, regional blood flows, and resistance. 49 Clearance of 125 I-labeled human serum albumin was used to study total blood volume and changes in vascular permeability. PAF at doses of 0.05 -5.00 mcg caused a significant fall in blood pressure (BP) and PVR, whereas CO did not change significantly. In conscious rats, low doses of PAF increased blood flow and decreased vascular resistance in all vascular beds, whereas high doses reduced mesenteric blood flow in part by increasing mesenteric vascular resistance. 50 The hypotensive and cardiac effects of PAF were blocked by intravenous infusions of the selective PAF-R antagonists (PAF-RAs), 15 mg/kg BN 52021 and 1 mg/kg SDZ 63-441. Intravenous infusion of PAF (1 nmol/600 g body weight) in unanesthetized guinea pigs caused profound hypotension that was reversed by a thyrotropinreleasing hormone analog, when injected into the cerebral ventricles, but not when injected systemically. 51

Circulatory responses to PAF were assessed following intravenous infusion of PAF (30 μ g/kg/min) to anesthetized dogs. 52 This caused a marked reduction in BP, CO, myocardial contractile force, renal blood flow, and glomerular filtration. Intracoronary administration of PAF (0.3 -3 μ g) reduced BP, coronary blood flow, and myocardial contractile force. In contrast, administration of PAF into the femoral vascular bed increased femoral artery blood flow. 52 A similar response was noted following infusion of low dose PAF (10 100 ng/min) -into the left pulmonary artery of fetal lambs, which was associated with an increase in pulmonary arterial blood flow, that was blocked by pretreatment with the selective PAF-RA, CV-3988. 53

Endogenous PAF is synthesized and released during acute inflammatory and allergic reactions in experimental animal models and correlates with inflammatory and hemodynamic alterations. Administration of exogenous PAF reproduces those changes in a dose-dependent manner. The following section examines the effect of PAF-RAs. The effects of PAF-RAs were evaluated in an acute PAFinduced mortality model in female NMRI mice. The PAFRAs, WEB 2170, and WEB 2086 provided the best dosedependent protection against PAF toxicity, followed by dexamethasone, by the COX/LOX synthetase inhibitor X 86 (a BW 755 C-analog), and by the PAF-RA BN 52021. 54 Other drugs, that is, indomethacin, the thromboxane receptor antagonist, BM 13177, the thromboxane synthetase inhibitor, HOE 944, as well as the lipoxygenase inhibitors

(NDGA, esculetin, SHAM, and phenidone) exerted a dosedependent protection only at high doses.

Intravenous treatment with E5880, a novel analogtype antagonist of PAF, dose-dependently reversed PAFinduced hypotension in rats and protected mice from lethality caused by PAF. LPS-induced hypotension in rats was inhibited by both preand posttreatment with E5880. 55 It was also confirmed that blood PAF level, measured by GC MS, was increased after LPS challenge in -this model. Furthermore, E5880 was extremely effective in preventing passive anaphylactic lethality in mice. Blood PAF level in this model was also increased immediately after antigen challenge, and this was coincident with the time at which signs of shock became apparent. These findings support the concept that PAF is an important mediator in the development of LPS-induced shock and anaphylactic shock.

A specific PAF-RA, BN52021, was used to determine its effects on the hemodynamic events and on survival in severe rat endotoxemia. 56 Endotoxin alone significantly produced hypotension, prostaglandins (TxB2, PGE2) release, and death. In contrast, pretreatment with BN52021 significantly altered the hypotension, significantly attenuated the eicosanoid release, and improved the survival rate ( p &lt; 0.01). These findings suggest that PAF-R activation is an early event in endotoxemia.

Endotoxin (10 mg/kg, iv) induced hypotension in anesthetized rats that was accompanied by a decrease in CO and an increase in calculated TPR, suggesting that this hypotension mainly resulted from the reduced CO. 57 The endotoxin-induced decrease in CO and hemoconcentration was significantly attenuated by TCV-309 (a PAFRA), ibuprofen (a cyclooxygenase inhibitor), or S-1452 (a thromboxane A2/prostaglandin H2-receptor antagonist). In the first 3 h following endotoxin administration, ibuprofen and S-1452 showed only early protection and TCV-309 showed late attenuation of the endotoxininduced hypotension. Tachycardiac responses to endotoxin were only blocked by ibuprofen but not by TCV309 or S-1452. These results suggest that both PAF and cyclooxygenase product(s), including thromboxane A2, mediate the decrease in CO, and hypotension in rat experimental endotoxic shock. Using a mouse model of experimental endotoxin shock, the effect of ST 899, a PAF-RA, on serum tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interferonγ (IFNγ ) production as well as on lethality in an experimental endotoxin shock model was investigated in C57BL/6 mice. 58 Animals received 40 mg/kg LPS ( E . coli 055:B5) intraperitoneally. Pretreatment with ST 899 dose-dependently reduced the mortality induced by LPS injection. The PAF-RA also reduced the LPS-induced increase in serum TNF. Serum IL-6 levels were not affected.

Similar findings have been reported in other species, including pigs 59 -61 and horses. 62

Using a PAF-RA (UK-74,505) and PAF-R knockout mice, Soares et al. 63 investigated the relevance of PAF for the inflammatory changes and lethality after pulmonary infection with the gram-negative bacteria Klebsiella pneumoniae in mice. An inoculum of 3 /C2 10 6 Klebsiella bacteria resulted in a marked pulmonary neutrophilic infiltrate that started 2.5 h after infection and peaked at 48 h. All animals were dead by Day 4 of infection. The proinflammatory cytokine TNFα increased rapidly and persisted for 48 h in the lungs. Pretreatment with UK74505 (30 mg/kg/day, po) had no significant effect on the neutrophilic infiltrate in BAL fluid or lung tissue whereas concentrations of TNFα and the number of bacteria inside neutrophils were significantly diminished. 63 The effect of the PAF-RA, WEB 2086, was assessed in anesthetized spontaneously breathing adult male Sprague -Dawley rats following injection of E coli . (10 9 CFU/100 g body weight). Pulmonary artery pressure (PAP), BP, heart rate (HR), and arterial blood gas (ABG) were measured at 10-min intervals. E . coli bacteremia increased HR, PAP, and respiratory rate early during sepsis (within 20 min), while hypoxemia, hypotension, and hemoconcentration were not manifest until the second hour. Pretreatment with WEB 2086 completely abrogated these changes. 64

In a model of intestinal ischemia/reperfusion injury, Sprague -Dawley rats were anesthetized and cannulated for measurement of MAP, HR, and CO. The superior mesenteric artery was occluded for 45 min and reperfused for 120 min. The PAF-RA WEB 2086 was administered as a bolus 15 min prior to reperfusion. Treatment with WEB 2086 attenuated the pulmonary leak during the entire reperfusion period but improved CO only during the first 30 min of reperfusion and had no effect on other hemodynamic variables. 65

The studies above strongly support a role for PAF in the pathogenesis of experimental endotoxemia and gramnegative bacteremia. Further studies also implicate PAF in gram-positive bacterial pneumonia and in the pathogenesis of viral infections. Using an LD100 mouse model of synergy between influenza infection preceding pneumococcal challenge primed for pneumonia, the authors examined the role of the PAF-R in potentiation of pneumococcal adherence and invasion in the lung. Mice pretreated with the PAF-RA, CV-6209, had survival rates similar to control mice, whereas none of the mice without CV-6209 pretreatment survived. 66 Severe dengue infection in humans causes thrombocytopenia, increased vascular permeability, hemorrhage, and shock. Treatment is supportive. The authors hypothesized that activation of PAF-R could account for the major systemic

manifestations of dengue infection. 67 Adult mice were inoculated with an adapted strain of dengue virus. In PAF-R /C0 / /C0 mice, there was decreased thrombocytopenia, hemoconcentration, decreased systemic levels of cytokines, and delay of lethality, when compared with wildtype infected mice. Treatment with UK-74,505, an orally active PAF-RA, prevented these manifestations, as well as hypotension and increased vascular permeability, and decreased lethality, even when started 5 days after virus inoculation. Similar results were obtained with another PAF-RA and PCA-4246. The authors concluded that activation of PAF-R plays a major role in the pathogenesis of experimental dengue infection, and its blockade prevents more severe disease manifestations after infection.

Interesting data have emerged from animal models implicating PAF in the pathogenesis of IgE-mediated reactions. BALB/c mice were sensitized to ovalbumin and challenged with OVA causing a profound drop in systemic arterial pressure that was largely attenuated by pretreatment with the PAF-RA CV-6209. 68,69 Similar results have been observed in active peanut anaphylaxis in mice. Mice were sensitized with peanut protein and cholera toxin and treated with either a 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor or a PAF-RA or histamine receptor antagonist or a combination of a PAF-RA with antihistamine. 70 Neither the 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor nor the antihistamine alone exhibited a protective effect. However, the PAF-RA reduced the magnitude and duration of hypotension and markedly shortened the time to recovery. The combination of the PAF-RA and antihistamine significantly reduced vascular leakage.

Another means of establishing the significance of PAF as a central mediator has been by manipulation of the PAF-R. Transgenic mice were developed that overexpressed a guinea pig PAF-R. These transgenic mice showed both bronchial hyperreactivity to methacholine and increased mortality to bacterial endotoxin. 71,72 In contrast, disruption of the PAF-R gene in mice was associated with a marked reduction in systemic anaphylactic symptoms but remained sensitive to bacterial endotoxins. 73 A 100% lethal murine model of pulmonary infection with K pneumoniae . showed marked pulmonary neutrophilia that started 2.5 h after infection and peaked at 48 h. All animals were dead by Day 4 of infection. In PAF-R-deficient mice, lethality occurred earlier than in wild-type controls. This was associated with greater number of bacteria in lung tissue and diminished percentage of neutrophils containing bacteria in their cytoplasm, suggesting that PAF, acting on its receptor, plays a protective role during infection with K . pneumoniae in mice. 63 Curiously, this association was not seen in mice infected with either Trypanosoma cruzi 74 or Leishmania amazonensis . 75 PAFR deficient mice showed greater

parasitemia and lethality than their wild-type controls. Injury caused by ischemia followed by reperfusion was largely abrogated in PAFR deficient mice 76 PAF-R /C0 / /C0 mice had little tissue or systemic inflammation and lethality was delayed but not prevented.

PAF is hydrolyzed to a biologically less active form, lyso-PAF, by the circulating enzyme PAF-AH. PAF-AH may be seen as a protective enzyme to the extent that high levels of circulating PAF may be deleterious. In an LD100 mouse model of PAF-induced death, pretreatment of mice with PAF-AH reduced mortality in a dosedependent manner, with complete prevention of mortality at 1.0 mg/kg. 77 The same authors examined the protective effect of PAF-AH in an active anaphylactic shock model where bovine serum albumin (BSA) was injected intravenously into mice previously sensitized with BSA. The protective effect of PAF-AH on mortality in this model was significant at 1.0 mg/kg.

## 3 | ADULT AND PEDIATRIC DATA OF PAF/PAF-AH IN VARIOUS DISEASE STATES AND AS BIOMARKERS OF DISEASE

In keeping with the biological effects of PAF, it has wide reaching effects on many organ systems and diseases in humans. 9,78 80 -Figure 1 provides an overview of the reported effects of PAF. 9,23,79,81 PAF and PAF-AH are also both biomarkers of disease states (Table 1). A few conditions will be elaborated with a focus on recent updates.

## 3.1 | Anaphylaxis

Given the central role of PAF in experimental models of anaphylaxis, Vadas et al., 6 prospectively studied acute anaphylaxis in 41 patients from age 15- to 74-years old. Low PAF-AH was significantly increased in the proportion of patients with severe (vs. less severe) anaphylaxis. Furthermore, in a postmortem analysis, 9 patients from age 9- to 24-years old who experienced fatal anaphylaxis had low PAF-AH versus only 3/10 controls ( p &lt; 0.01). These findings are further supported by a report of low basal PAF-AH in adults who had hymenoptera venom allergy (HVA) induced anaphylaxis. 82 In the HVA patients, PAF-AH activity was inversely correlated with anaphylaxis severity. Another study of HVA compared the PAF-AH activity within patients grouped by anaphylaxis severity and to nonallergic controls. They found PAF-AH activity was significantly lower in HVA than in healthy people. 83 Most recently, Bilo et al. 84 reported serum PAF-

They again confirmed that compared to healthy controls, PAF-AH was significantly lower in HVA patients ( p &lt; 0.001), and they also found PAF-AH was lower than controls in asthma patients ( p = 0.001) and patients with rhinitis ( p = 0.014).

Clinical studies have focused on adults and adolescents and have assessed PAF and PAF-AH at the time of anaphylaxis or when well. Our group recently prospectively studied pediatric patients presenting with various levels of severity of anaphylaxis and assessed PAF-AH activity at both their time of presentation with anaphylaxis and in a follow-up time point for their basal levels. We demonstrated that serum PAF-AH activity is a biomarker of severe anaphylaxis and that the activity is unchanged from basal levels during acute anaphylaxis. 18

Further understanding of the role of PAF-AH as a biomarker may include evaluating genetic risk alleles, focusing on controlled circumstances such as anaphylactic risk during immunotherapy and therapeutic trials of PAF inhibitors/blockers to reduce the severity of anaphylaxis. 95

In a pediatric study, the transcriptional activity of the PAF-AH Gene (PLA2G7) was demonstrated to be lower in children with moderate anaphylaxis versus those with mild and versus children with atopic dermatitis. Furthermore, the children with cardiovascular manifestations had the lowest transcriptional activity. 85

## 3.2 | Cardiovascular disease

Examination of PAF-AH activity has been endorsed for risk assessment in cardiac disease. 88,89 Further demonstration of a role in circulatory health is found in genetic alleles. The Japanese population carries a common lossof-function mutation, V279F, in more than 30% of Japanese subjects (4% homozygous, 27% heterozygous) which results in an enzymatic deficiency. The V279F allele is purported to be a risk factor for inflammatory diseases. 10 In Chinese Han, 96 four polymorphisms (R92H, I198T, A379V, and V279F) were studied for their relationship with cardiac disease and found significant

associations for R92H and I198T. A comprehensive review on the genetic variability of PAF-AH highlighted that the interpretation of alleles requires consideration of their function, individual genetic complexities, and environmental influences. Accordingly, a metanalysis of 14 studies in diverse populations encompassing 12,432 patients with clinical atherosclerosis and 10,171 controls found the V279F polymorphism is protective and R92H is a risk factor for atherosclerosis with the findings specific to race. 97

## 3.3 | Ocular disease

PAF and PAF-R are widely distributed in the structures of the eye, and PAF has been detected in the tear film. PAF has been implicated in the pathogenesis of multiple ocular disorders including allergic conjunctivitis, macular degeneration, ocular pain, uveitis, and diabetic complications of retinopathy and neovascularization. 93

## 3.4 | COVID-19

It has been postulated that the proinflammatory features of PAF (Figure 1) and its effects on the endothelium fit well with the pathology of COVID-19. 98,99 This hypothesis is further supported by the molecular identification of compounds which may block viral cell entry were also known to inhibit PAF synthesis. 98

## 4 | THE PAF PATHWAY AS A THERAPEUTIC TARGET FOR DISEASE

Despite the large body of mechanistic data and its identification as a biomarker in multiple human disease, therapeutic trials targeting the PAF pathway (predominantly with PAF-RAs) have been mostly disappointing. Trials for asthma, 81 sepsis, 100,101 neuroprotection after coronary

artery bypass, 102 acute pancreatitis, 103 cardiovascular outcomes, 104 and autoimmune conditions such as ulcerative colitis 105 and rheumatoid arthritis 106 have not lead to a commercialized pharmaceutical therapy.

Possible reasons for the inconsistency between the vast body of literature supporting a central role for PAF and the lack of successful phase 3 trial interventions in this pathway are multifold. It is now recognized PAF has complex pro and antiinflammatory effects 107,108 and that PAF-like compounds can act through mechanisms other than the PAF-R. 109 Considerations for this discrepancy are presented in Table 2.

In addition to being of great interest as a therapeutic target of medications, the activity of PAF is modified by multiple foods. There is an increasing body of literature supporting that effects of PAF are at the core of the antiinflammatory properties of the Mediterranean diet 110 and of the effect of the herbal ginkolides. 111,112

## 5 | CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE PERSPECTIVES

PAF is a mediator active at low nanomolar concentrations that was first identified in animal models. As we better understand this mediator of inflammation, its role in immediate hypersensitivity-type allergic reactions and various inflammatory processes continue to evolve. PAF is produced by a variety of cells and through two distinct pathways; the majority of PAF is produced by the remodeling pathway, and low levels are produced through the de novo pathway. 4 PAF and PAF agonists are primarily regulated by PAF-AHs, which hydrolyze PAF to the biologically inactive lyso-PAF, and is found in high concentrations in tissues rich in macrophages. 12 Changes in PAF-AH plasma activity has been associated with severe allergic responses, 22 and fatal anaphylaxis. 23 Increased plasma PAF-AH activity was reported in ischemic stroke,

myocardial infarction, familial HDL deficiency, chronic cholestasis, diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, essential hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, and habitual cigarette smokers. 10 This increase is potentially due to mechanisms intended to control PAF production during acute inflammation, as enhanced synthesis and secretion of plasma PAF-AH was identified during differentiation of monocytes to macrophages.

PAF exerts its effects by binding to the PAF-R which triggers an intracellular signaling network primarily through activation of G-proteins. PAF-R is regulated through unique PAF-R transcripts that are controlled by two unique promoters. PAF-R promoter 1 responds to inflammatory stimuli and PAF-R promoter 2 is controlled by differentiation signals. Additionally, PAF-R can be regulated by homologous desensitization of exogenous PAF, ligand-induced internalization, or uncoupling from G-proteins. The role of PAF in platelet aggregation and activation results in increased vascular permeability, circulatory collapse, and decreased CO, which can be treated with PAF-RAs. This has been examined in numerous animal models. The intravenous injection of PAF-RA BN 52021 in cirrhotic male Wistar rats induced a significant decrease in CO with an increase in PVR in cirrhotic animals compared to controls. 45 Intradermal injection of PAF has been shown to elicit an acute inflammatory response in guinea pig skin. 42 Exogenous PAF caused hypotension plasma extravasation, metabolic acidosis, and death in rats. Airway pressures and pulmonary vascular resistance increased with exogenous PAF.

Endogenous PAF is synthesized and released during acute inflammatory and allergic reactions in experimental animal models, and PAF-RAs were found to provide dose-dependent protection against PAF toxicity. Pretreatment with PAF-RA BN52021 significantly altered hypotension produced by endotoxin in rats, 56 which suggest that PAF-R activation is an early event in endotoxemia. Additionally, PAF plays a role in the pathogenesis of

gram-negative bacteremia. Pretreatment of the PAF-RA UK-74,505 showed significantly diminished concentrations of TNFα and the number of bacteria inside neutrophils in rats compared to control animals with no pretreatment. 63 Data have emerged from animal models implicating PAF in the pathogenesis of IgE-mediated reactions. Mice were sensitized to an allergen and treated with either a PAF-RA or histamine receptor antagonist 70 before allergic challenge. It was found that PAF-RA reduced magnitude and duration of hypotension and shortened recovery.

PAF and PAF-AH have also been investigated as biomarkers of disease states in humans. In adults who had HVA, basal PAF-AH was significantly lower than nonallergic controls. Among HPA patients, PAF-AH activity was inversely correlated with anaphylaxis severity. As well, at least two genetic alleles have been identified as factors of cardiac disease. Decreased or loss of PAF-AH function has been reported in several populations due to inactivating mutations in the gene, such as the Val279Phe loss-of-function mutation. There is significant association between the PAF-AH Val279Phe mutation and cerebral-vascular accident, nonfamilial cardiomyopathy, atherosclerotic occlusive disease, and myocardial infarcts.

To conclude, PAF is a potent inflammatory mediator affecting multiple organs and implicated in many systems and diseases. It can induce life threatening and fatal reactions in animal models. PAF has been implicated as an important mast cell mediator in fatal anaphylaxis. The future use of PAF antagonists as a therapeutic intervention is promising.
