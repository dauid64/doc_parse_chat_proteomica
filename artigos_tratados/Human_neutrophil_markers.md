Abstract Neutrophils  are  essential  effector  cells  in  the host  defense  against  invading  pathogens.  Recently,  novel neutrophil functions have emerged in addition to their classical anti-microbial role. One of these functions is the suppression  of  T  cell  responses.  In  this  respect,  neutrophils share  similarities  with  granulocytic  myeloid-derived  suppressor  cells  (G-MDSCs).  In  this  review,  we  will  discuss the  similarities  and  differences  between  neutrophils  and G-MDSCs. Various types of G-MDSCs have been described, ranging from immature to mature cells shaping the immune response  by  different  immune  suppressive  mechanisms. However, all types of G-MDSCs share distinct features of neutrophils, such as surface markers and morphology. We propose  that  G-MDSCs  are  heterogeneous  and  represent novel phenotypes of neutrophils, capable of suppressing the immune response. In this review, we will attempt to clarify the  differences  and  similarities  between  neutrophils  and G-MDSCs and attempt to facilitate further research.

## Introduction

Neutrophils  are important  effector cells in the innate immune  response  against  invading  micro-organisms  [1]. The cells possess multiple powerful mechanisms enabling them to migrate towards, engage with, in particular, small targets and kill them intracellularly [1]. The importance of these cells is illustrated by the fact that neutrophils and/or neutrophil-like cells have already developed early in evolution [2]. Cells with phagocytic function and neutrophil-specific proteins are now found in species ranging from simple organisms such as sea fan corrals [3] to complex organisms such as mammals [4].

The evolution from simple to complex organisms resulted in  the  origin  of  the  adaptive  immune system. This review will  focus  on  recent  data  showing  the  existence  of  multiple functional phenotypes of neutrophils that, beyond their well-recognized anti-microbial functions, are able to steer and shape the adaptive immune system. But before reviewing these functional phenotypes in detail, it is important to first discuss recent data with respect to: (1) definitions for priming and phenotypes and (2) the life cycle and compartmentalization of neutrophils.

Switching phenotype and priming: two distinct mechanisms

In this review, we define granulocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (G-MDSCs) as a phenotype of neutrophils. A phenotype refers  to  a  cell  that  either  in  the  bone  marrow or by instruction in the periphery (Fig. 1) develops towards a  cell  with  a  specialized  function,  which  distinguishes  it from other cells. In the case of G-MDSCs, this would be their ability to suppress the adaptive immune response. It is only recently that neutrophils are accepted to have multiple

Fig. 1 Priming versus functional phenotypes of neutrophils. This figure illustrates that phenotypes are defined as cells that retain specialized functions for a prolonged time. Priming refers to the mechanism that  is  rapidly  and  reversibly  induced  by  soluble  or  cell  associated mediators such as platelet activating factor (PAF) [7], which potentiate functions of neutrophils but do not change their overall function. Priming can potentiate all different phenotypes and functions, such as migration, production of ROS and phagocytosis

phenotypes and, surprisingly, little is known regarding the occurrence and induction mechanisms of these neutrophil phenotypes.  Few  examples  exist  of  neutrophils  switching between phenotypes and it is unknown whether neutrophils with different phenotypes differentiate from specialized precursors (see also below, e.g., Fig. 4). Phenotype switching by neutrophils has recently been reported by the addition of granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GMCSF) to mature and immature murine bone marrow-derived neutrophils. These neutrophils acquired properties of dendritic  cells  such  as  antigen  presentation  but  retained  their anti-microbial properties [5].

In contrast to induction of phenotypes, priming can also modulate  the  functionality of neutrophils. Non-primed neutrophils  are  relatively  refractory  to  activation,  limiting aspecific  activation. This  process  functions  as  a  safe  lock mechanism and has been extensively reviewed elsewhere [6, 7]. Only after priming (typically by a cytokine, chemokine

<!-- image -->

or  bioactive  lipid)  can  a  neutrophil  optimally  exert  functions such as the generation of a respiratory burst induced by fMLF [8] or chemotaxis [9].

Priming is a mechanism distinct from changing of phenotype, as it reversibly potentiates effector functions of neutrophils but does not change their overall function.

## The life cycle of a neutrophil

Despite the consensus regarding the importance of neutrophils in host defense. surprisingly little is known about very basic  characteristics  of  these  cells  in  respect  to  their  life cycle. As stated above, it is only recently that neutrophils are accepted to have multiple phenotypes. A possible reason  that  neutrophil  subtypes  were  overlooked  is  the  view that they are short-lived cells, which perform their duty and subsequently  rapidly  go  into  apoptosis  in  the  tissue.  This view is based on experiments labeling and tracing neutrophils with radioactive isotopes [10-13]. These experiments, which used ex vivo and potentially toxic labeling techniques, showed  a  peripheral  blood  half-life  of  only  7-25  h.  Our recent paper using in vivo labeling with the stable isotope 2 H suggests a half-life of 3.8 days [14]. This result remains a matter of debate, as Li et al. [15] suggested that the observed results could also be explained by a 3.8-day division time of neutrophil progenitors. Moreover, the view that neutrophils in tissue cannot return to the peripheral blood has been challenged by several studies. Already in 1974, Vincent et al. [16] showed in calves that, after disappearance of most labeled neutrophils from blood, hydrocortisone can induce their return into the circulation, where they stay for at least another 24 h. More recently, several studies have provided additional evidence that support the view that neutrophils do not simply die by apoptosis in the tissues but move to additional sites in the body. These studies show homing of neutrophils to secondary lymphoid tissue [17] and reverse migration of cells over endothelium in vitro and in vivo [18, 19].  Reverse  migration  and  remobilization  of  neutrophils has also been shown very elegantly in zebrafish larvae demonstrating migration of neutrophils from a site of inflammation toward different organs throughout the organism [20].

Taken together, these data demonstrate that at least a subpopulation of neutrophils can survive for much longer than previously appreciated, allowing more time for these cells to switch phenotypes and exert functions beyond cytotoxicity against invading pathogens.

## Myeloid-derived suppressor cells

One of the recently described neutrophil phenotypes is the myeloid-derived  suppressor  cells  (MDSCs).  These  cells were firstly identified at the beginning of this century and

described as immature myeloid cells that suppress immune responses  in  the  spleens  of  tumor-bearing  mice  [21-23]. Such immune suppression was earlier attributed to myeloid cells,  but  this  activity  was  confined  to  differentiated  cells such as macrophages [24]. As research progressed on these immature myeloid cells, it became clear that they consisted of a heterogeneous group of cells, consisting of (precursors of) granulocytes and monocytes, and that these cells were not always immature [25]. The term myeloid-derived suppressor cell was coined in 2007 by Gabrilovic et al. [26] to encompass the heterogeneity of these cells.

Considering  the  granulocytic  component  of  MDSCs, there  is  still  discussion  on  their  differences  and  similarities  with  neutrophils.  Recently,  research  on  neutrophils described various novel neutrophil functions, such as antigen  presentation,  inhibition  of  immune  responses,  and induction of B cell class switching [27-29]. In addition, it has been known for decades that neutrophils reside in the spleen in health and disease [30], a location frequently sampled for MDSCs [31-33]. As the research fields concerning neutrophils and granulocytic MDSCs seem to have evolved in separate ways, this review will attempt to clarify the differences and similarities between these cells and attempt to unify and guide further research.

## Identification of neutrophils and G-MDSCs

G-MDSCs are MDSCs of granulocytic origin. According to this  definition,  these  cells  can  belong  to  one  of  three  different types of granulocytes: neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils. However, only neutrophils have been described as a component of MDSCs [34, 35]. Multiple surface markers  and  characteristics  that  identify  G-MDSCs  have  been described.  Before  going  into  detail  about  the  different G-MDSCs characteristics, we will first clearly define how to identify a neutrophil in order to discuss the similarities and differences with G-MDSCs.

## Neutrophil identification

The  gold  standard  to  identify  a  neutrophil  is  by  visual inspection  under  a  light  microscope.  When  stained  with May-Grünwald-Giemsa or similar, neutrophils can be easily distinguished by the shape of their nucleus and cytoplasmic color/granularity  (Fig.  2). The  nucleus  should  either  have a band or (hyper)segmented shape and a light pink/purple cytoplasm  filled  with  similarly  colored  ('neutrophilic') granules [36].

Identification of neutrophils by flow cytometry may be more  convenient  than  visual  inspection,  as  the  latter  is  a more laborious and subjective method. In mice, flow cytometric identification of neutrophils can easily be performed

by using the neutrophil-specific marker Ly6G [37]. Traditionally, Ly6G is combined with CD11b, but this is not necessary when using the specific Ly6G antibody 1A8 [37].

Human neutrophils lack a marker similar to Ly6G, but can be reliably identified nonetheless (Table 1). In studies on MDSCs, CD11b and CD33 are traditionally used as markers for human MDSCs. However, these markers are expressed on all  cells  of  the  myelocytic  lineage  and  on  NKcells,  so they are not specific enough to identify human neutrophils [38-40].  Other  markers  used  are  CD14  and  CD15.  Neutrophils  (or  G-MDSCs)  are  found  to  be  CD14 neg/low and CD15 pos , whereas monocytes (or Mo-MDSCs) are CD14 high and CD15 neg/low [35]. Unfortunately, these two markers are not  sufficient  to  identify  neutrophils,  as  eosinophils  have a  similar  CD15  expression  [41]. We  suggest  CD16  as  an additional  marker,  as  mature  neutrophils  are  CD16 high , eosinophils are CD16 neg , and monocytes either CD16 neg or CD16 int .  Therefore,  CD16  allows  for  distinction  between these two types of granulocytes. An additional advantage of using CD16 is that its expression varies between the different stages of neutrophil maturation: neutrophil progenitors capable  of  dividing  are  CD16 neg ,  with  increasing  expressions  in  metamyelocytes,  banded  and  mature  neutrophils, respectively  [38].  CD16  alone  is  not  enough  to  identify neutrophils, since NK cells and monocytes also express this marker [42].

In short, we suggest the use of Ly6G for identification of murine neutrophils and the combination of CD14, CD15 and CD16 for identification of human mature neutrophils. We do want to emphasize the importance of visual inspection,  which  remains  the  gold  standard  to  identify  neutrophils. Visual  inspection  should  routinely  be  performed  in order to eliminate the possibility of other cell types expressing neutrophil markers under certain clinical conditions.

## G-MDSCs versus neutrophils

As  mentioned  above,  G-MDSCs  have  been  implicated  to have a similar expression of CD14 and CD15 as neutrophils, while  mature  or  banded  G-MDSCs  and  neutrophils  also have similar CD16 expression. However, there seems to be one prime feature that distinguishes them from normal neutrophils: immune suppression. Several methods have been proposed to distinguish between the suppressive G-MDSCs and circulating neutrophils and will be discussed below.

## Identification of G-MDSCs: flow cytometry

Several papers have shown differences between G-MDSCs and  normal  neutrophils  in  the  expression  of  cell  surface markers  visualized  by  flow  cytometry.  Greifenberg  et  al. [43]  identified  two  subsets  of  neutrophils  with  a  different CD11b expression in the spleens of healthy mice. Of these

|       | Neutrophil  (mature)   | Eosinophil   | Monocyte   | NK cell   |
|-------|------------------------|--------------|------------|-----------|
| CD14  | ±                      | -            | ++         | -         |
| CD15  | ++                     | ++           | ±          | -         |
| CD16  | ++                     | -            | +          | ++        |
| CD11b | ++                     | ++           | ++         | ++        |

two populations, only the relatively low (but still positive) CD11b-expressing cells were found to be immune suppressive and, therefore, exhibited characteristics of G-MDSCs. Youn  et  al.  [44]  found  an  increased  proportion  of  neutrophils  expressing  SLAMF4  (CD244)  in  mice  bearing

may also  become  hypersegmented,  with  more  than  4  nuclear  lobes (human) or a cloverleaf shape (mouse). It is unknown whether hypersegmented neutrophils are more mature than segmented neutrophils

several different tumors. In some, but not all, of these tumor models, there was also an increased population of neutrophils  expressing  CSF1-R  (CD115).  When  they  compared the  CD244-positive  and  -negative  populations,  only  the CD244 pos cells were found to be immune suppressive. The consequences  of  these  findings  for  the  human  situation remain to be established.

In humans,  an  enhanced  expression  of  the  IL-4R α (CD124) was found on suppressive cells. This marker was found  on  the  G-MDSCs  of  patients  with  non-small  cell lung carcinoma [45]. However, another paper found CD124 expression  to  correlate  only  with  immune  suppression  by monocyte-derived MDSCs  [46].  Therefore, it remains uncertain  whether  CD124  can  be  used  to  identify  human G-MDSCs.

In  severely  injured  patients  and  in  a  human  acute inflammation  model,  our  group  has  identified  distinct

neutrophil subsets of which the CD62L dim /CD16 bright subset was immune suppressive [29]. In contrast to the findings by Greifenberg, who showed G-MDSCs to be lower in CD11b expression, this CD62L dim /CD16 bright subset showed a trend of higher CD11b expression [43]. Other markers upregulated in these suppressive cells were CD11c, CD32, CD35, CD45, and  CD66b. The  suppressive  cells  could,  however,  not  be clearly distinguished on the basis of these latter markers.

Puga et al. [28] show two different subtypes of neutrophils in the human spleen, named N BH1 and  N BH2 (B  cell helper neutrophils). These subtypes have a higher expression  of  B  cell  activating  factor  (BAFF)  and  CD11b,  and lower  expressions  of  CD15,  CD16,  CD62P,  and  CD62L compared to blood cells. Additionally, the N BH2 cells have a  higher  CD27,  CD40L, CD86, and HLA-II compared to both circulating and N BH1 neutrophils. Unfortunately, they only assessed immune suppression by splenic neutrophils as a whole. Therefore, it is unclear whether only one of these two subtypes or both are suppressive and which markers can distinguish between suppressive and normal neutrophils.

In  conclusion,  many  markers  are  shown  to  distinguish suppressive  G-MDSCs  from  non-suppressive  neutrophils. However, so far, none of these candidates have been confirmed by other papers and some findings are contradictory (e.g., CD11b, IL-4R α ). Thus, to date, no single or combined expression of surface markers can reliably identify suppressive neutrophils or G-MDSCs in either humans or mice.

## Identification of G-MDSCs: density centrifugation

Centrifugation  of  blood  over  a  layer  with  a  density  of 1.077 g/ml is a common step in the isolation of leukocytes from whole blood [47]. Due to their relatively high density, neutrophils end up below the layer, on top of the erythrocyte  fraction,  whereas  the  PBMC  fraction  is  found  in  the interphase  between  this  layer  and  the  plasma.  Schmielau and Finn [48], and Rodriquez et al. [49] found immune suppressive G-MDSCs in the PBMC fraction of cancer patients. These cells show an activated phenotype, characterized by increased CD66b and CD11b expression. Also, they show the  immune  suppression  to  be  mediated  by  the  CD66bexpressing cells [49]. However, they did not show whether the  neutrophils  with  normal  density  in  the  same  patients were  also  suppressive,  and  therefore  it  remains  uncertain whether density centrifugation can distinguish between suppressive and non-suppressive cells. In vitro activation of neutrophils from healthy donors resulted in neutrophils with a similar density and suppressive capabilities, indicating that, in  this  system,  G-MDSCs  might  be  activated  neutrophils [49]. Density centrifugation remains a widely used method for the isolation of human MDSCs in cancer patients, but there is still a lack of data on the differences between these G-MDSCs and neutrophils from these patients [50].

## Identification of G-MDSCs: gene profiling

Even though it is not possible to isolate cells based on gene expression patterns, it is likely that cells with different functions will have different gene expression profiles. Fridlender et al. [51] showed differences in the transcriptome of naïve bone marrow neutrophils in healthy mice, blood G-MDSCs from  tumor-bearing  mice,  and  tumor-associated  neutrophils  (TANs).  The  cells  from  the  blood  of  tumor-bearing mice  have  a  low  expression  of  mRNA  for  cytokines  and chemokines compared to TANs. Compared to bone marrow cells,  G-MDSCs  show  a  low  mRNA  expression  of  granule  proteins,  NADPH complex subunits, and peroxidases. Unfortunately,  the  location  of  neutrophils  can  influence their functionality [52], so it is unclear whether these differences were specific for G-MDSCs or a result of different localization/maturation. For instance, it is likely that neutrophils produce their granule and respiratory burst proteins during maturation and store them for later use, explaining the high amounts of mRNA for these proteins [53, 54].

Another transcriptome analysis by Youn et al. [44] compared  neutrophils  from  naïve  and  tumor-bearing  mice.  It showed an upregulation of MPO and proteins involved in cell-cycle pathways in G-MDSCs from tumor-bearing mice. In contrast, neutrophils from naïve mice show an upregulation in mRNA for cytokines, chemokines, proteases, and other pro-inflammatory proteins.

Other proteins found to be upregulated in G-MDSCs are arginase-I [49, 51, 55, 56], iNOS [57], and IL-10 [55]. As these three proteins are directly involved in mechanisms of immune suppression by G-MDSCs, they will be described in more detail in the section below.

## Identification of G-MDSCs: nuclear morphology

MDSCs  are  in  general  described  as  young  or  immature cells [58]. The nuclear morphology of neutrophils provides a  simple  tool  to  assess  their  age.  Neutrophils  possess  a distinct  nuclear  morphology  in  different  stages  of  development (Fig.  2).  Early  progenitors  have  a  round  nucleus, which  changes  during  maturation  into  the  horseshoe,  or 'banded', shape of a human immature neutrophil (a ringshape in mice). When these cells fully mature, the nucleus starts showing indentations and is called segmented. When the nucleus has 4 or more segments in humans, or a cloverleaf-shape in mice, it is called hypersegmented. Since neutrophils gain more indentations and segments upon maturation, it  is  tempting  to  address  hypersegmented  cells  as  'old'. However, there is evidence that segmented and hypersegmented neutrophils in humans are of similar age [59].

In the paper of Greifenberg et al. [43] mentioned above, the G-MDSCs population had a clear ring-shaped morphology, whereas the cells with a segmented nucleus were not

suppressive. This supports the notion of G-MDSCs being young/immature cells. Also, Fridlender et al. showed in a tumor  model  that  immune  suppressive  TANs  are  mostly immature, whereas, after TGFβ inhibition, the TANs were found  to  be  hypersegmented  and  did  not  suppress  tumor growth, thus implying loss of immune suppression [37].

Other  papers,  however,  shave  shown  no  difference  in nuclear  morphology  for  the  suppressive  cells  [44,  60]. Similarly, Dumitru et al. [35] have extensively reviewed the phenotype of suppressive G-MDSCs in human cancers and found them to be segmented in 8 out of 9 papers where the nuclear morphology was assessed [45, 48, 49, 56, 61-64]. In addition, in our model of acute inflammation and in severely injured patients, we have shown only the hypersegmented cells to be immune suppressive [29].

Taken together, nuclear morphology is not a good indication for immune suppressive functions and, therefore, of G-MDSCs. However, these differences do indicate the existence of several distinct G-MDSCs subtypes.

## G-MDSCs identification and subtypes: conclusion

When studying potential G-MDSCs (or suppressive neutrophils), one should first ascertain the cells of interest to be neutrophils. This can be done by flow cytometric determination of CD14, CD15, and CD16 expression and, ideally, assessing  nuclear  morphology  after  cell  sorting.  Density centrifugation is not a suitable method for isolating suppressive neutrophils, as it cannot distinguish suppressive cells from non-suppressive activated cells.

In various studies, different surface markers are shown to  distinguish  G-MDSCs  or  suppressive  neutrophils  from their non-suppressive counterparts. However, there are differences in expression of (activation) markers and nuclear morphology between these suppressive subsets. This demonstrates that there are several G-MDSCs phenotypes, possibly reflecting differences in localization, clinical condition, or origin.

## Mechanisms of immune suppression by suppressive neutrophils and G-MDSCs and their relevance to disease

Proliferation of T cells is influenced by many environmental factors. These factors, such as cytokines, growth factors, and amino acids, are easily altered in an inflammatory environment in the presence of other inflammatory cells such as neutrophils and G-MDSCs. Suppression of T cell responses can be achieved by depletion of essential amino acids from the  microenvironment,  such  as l -arginine  [65],  (massive) generation of reactive oxygen species [48], or through cellcell contact (Fig. 3) [29].

Fig. 3 Mechanisms  of  suppression  by  G-MDSCs  and  suppressive neutrophils.  Suppression  can  be  mediated  by  extracellular  arginase, extracellular  ROS,  or  ROS  in  an  immunological  synapse.  Al  these mechanisms  result  in  reduced  T  cell  proliferation,  via  decreases  in extracellular l -arginine, cofilin, TCR  expression, NFζ κ B activation, or unknown mechanisms

<!-- image -->

Production of anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10 by neutrophils has been proposed [60, 66]. However, this was  only  observed  in  murine  neutrophils  [67]  and  will, therefore, not be discussed in this review.

Recently, studies have shown that, in addition to limiting  T  cell  responses,  G-MDSCs  limit  NK-cell  responses and activation to vaccinia virus [68]. This was dependent on H2 O  production by G-MDSCs. Other studies have shown 2 reduced NK-cell responses by G-MDSCs in pregnancy, cancer, and in the tumor environment; however, no mechanism of suppression was reported [69-71].

## The role of arginase in T cell suppression by MDSCs

Arginase-1 (ARG1) was shown to be important in the suppression of immune responses by MDSCs in various murine models [72]. ARG1 metabolizes l -arginine into l -ornithine and urea. This depletes l -arginine from the micro-environment. The amino acid l -arginine has multiple roles such as its importance in wound healing [73]. In addition, it is the only endogenous substrate for the production of nitric oxide (NO) by inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) [74]. l -arginine is necessary for T cell proliferation, as, in the absence of l -arginine, the cell cycle of proliferating T cells arrests in the G0-G1 phase. [65].

Several mechanisms have been described to explain this l -arginine  depletion  mediated  inhibition  of  proliferation.

l -arginine influences the expression of the T cell receptor ζ chain (TCR , CD247) [75], and ARG-1 has been shown to ζ downregulate TCR  expression and T cell activation at the ζ level of TCR expression [76, 77]. The TCR/CD3 expression is regulated by continuous internalization and recycling of receptors.  The  level  of  surface  expression  of  the  receptor regulates  the  ability  of  a  T  cell  to  become  activated.  The rate of synthesis of the TCR -chain is rate limiting to that of ζ the other TCR/CD3 chains. Therefore, this chain is critically important in the regulation of TCR/CD3 internalization and recycling as it stabilizes the TCR/CD3 complex on the cell membrane. [78]. A second mechanism by which a depletion of l -arginine results in T cell suppression has recently been described. Feldemeyer et al. show that dephosphorylation of cofilin is decreased by depletion of l -arginine. Cofilin is a protein necessary for the remodeling of F-actin [79], which is essential for the formation of an immunological synapse and T cell proliferation [80].

ARG1 is widely expressed in murine myeloid cells and macrophages.  However,  in  humans,  it  has  only  convincingly been shown in neutrophils [34, 81]. Neutrophil ARG1 is synthesized  in their myelocyte  and  metamyelocyte stages and is located in the gelatinase containing granules of mature neutrophils [53, 81]. It is implicated in the host defense against fungi [81]. Activated neutrophils exocytose a form of ARG1 that is catalytically active at pH 9.5-10.5 [53,  82].  This  ARG1  becomes  active  at  a  physiological pH of 7.5 only after cleavage by a co-factor. The co-factor responsible for this cleavage has not been identified, but it has  been  suggested  to  be  located  in  azurophil  neutrophil granules.

Release of ARG1 by neutrophils requires cellular activation  and  degranulation  of  both  tertiary  (gelatinase)  and azurophllic granules. As stated above, human MDSCs have been shown to co-localize with PBMCs when isolated by density  separation.  Interestingly,  fMLF-activated  neutrophils  from  healthy  volunteers  show  similar  behavior  and co-localize  with  PBMCs  [48].  In  patients  suffering  from severe traumatic injury, the increase of ARG1 activity has also been attributed to activated neutrophils in the PBMC fraction [83]. In addition, increased serum ARG1 correlates with  degranulated  neutrophils  in  patients  with  glioblastoma multiforme [63]. These findings could implicate that G-MDSCs in humans that inhibit T cell proliferation via an ARG1-mediated mechanism are simply activated granulocytes [49].

As described above, ARG1 expression in myeloid cells of  mice  and  humans  is  essentially  different  [84].  Human studies have only correlated the degree and occurrence of ex  vivo  measured  ARG1-mediated  T  cell  suppression  to disease progression. Murine studies mostly focused on the association of ex vivo T cells suppression and occurrence of MDSCs in the spleen. The direct contribution of MDSCs to

in vivo T cell suppression in T cell-mediated diseases has remained largely uninvestigated, although, recently, ARG1 has been shown to limit graft versus host disease (GVHD) in mice. In this study, ARG1-expressing monocytic MDSCs were  generated  by  ex  vivo  incubation  with  G-CSF,  GMCSF, and IL-13. Adoptive transfer of these ARG1-expressing  cells  or  administration  of  pegylated-ARG1  limited pathology in this model [72].

## Reactive oxygen species

A hallmark of neutrophils and G-MDSCs is the potential to produce large amounts of reactive oxygen species (ROS). These  are  generated  by  the  NADPH-oxidase  complex  in neutrophils.  A  detailed  and  schematic  description  of  the generation of ROS is presented by Nathan and Ding [85]. Generation of superoxide anion (O2 -)  is  the  first  oxygen radical produced. O2 -can be converted to two substances that have been shown to mediate lymphocyte suppression. Firstly, O2 -can react with NO, producing reactive nitrogen species such as peroxynitrite. NO is generated by inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) using l -arginine as substrate, linking the generation of reactive nitrogen species to l -arginine metabolism as described above. Reactive nitrogen species are utilized in some models by monocytic MDSCs, but not by G-MDSCs and neutrophils, and will, therefore, not be discussed in this review [58].

The second substance formed from O2 -is H O  (hydro2 2 gen peroxide). H O  can be converted by myeloperoxidase 2 2 to hypochlorous acid (HOCl -). H O  can suppress lympho2 2 cyte proliferation through various mechanisms by inducing apoptosis, decreasing  Nfκ B  activation, downregulating TCR , and oxidation of cofilin [86-88]. ζ

Cofilin remodeling of F-actin is essential for the T cell effector function. Oxidation of cofilin results in its loss of  Ser3  phosphorylation [87]. Dephosphorylated cofilin is unable to mediate actin depolimerization, thus severely disturbing actin dynamics and impairing T cell activation [80]. Similar to l -arginine depletion, oxidative stress correlates with TCR  expression, although the exact mechaζ nism is  not  known.  In  addition,  oxidative  stress  blocks Nfκ B  activation  leading  to  impaired  T  cell  activation [88].

Of note is that regulatory T cells have been shown to be resistant  to  oxidative  stress  [89].  This  suggests  that  regulatory T  cells  are  less  suppressed  than  other T  cells,  thus enhancing the overall suppressive effect of H O  in vivo. 2 2

Suppression of T cell activation and proliferation requires high  concentrations  of  H O   [48,  87],  which  can  be  pro2 2 vided by the presence of large numbers of neutrophils at the site of T cell activation. This might be due to the fact that hydrogen peroxide is unstable and is rapidly converted to H2 O and O 2 . Indeed, activated neutrophils or G-MDSCs in

cancer patients have been shown to inhibit T cell responses in a H O -dependent manner [48]. 2 2

The relevance of H O 2 2 in  the  context  of  G-MDSCs  or neutrophil-mediated  suppression  is  difficult  to  study  in animal models. This is mainly due to the diverse biological functions of H O . Besides immune suppression, H O 2 2 2 2 and  its  metabolites  are  involved  in  bacterial  killing  [90]. In addition, it functions as a signaling molecule necessary for  diverse  cellular  functions  [90]  including  chemotaxis of immune cells. It has recently been shown that H O  is 2 2 a potent inducer of chemotaxis of neutrophil-like immune cells in a model of tissue injury in zebrafish [91]. Hydrogen  peroxide  might,  therefore,  also  indirectly  contribute to microbial clearance by attracting immune cells and killing bacteria. These functions of H O  are indispensable in 2 2 immune processes and, therefore, complicate the interpretation of studies targeting H O  to define its role in immune 2 2 suppression by G-MDSCs.

Caution must be taken in interpreting ex vivo suppression of T cell proliferation mediated by H O . Manipulation and 2 2 isolation  of  neutrophils  and  G-MDSCs  might  lead  to  cell priming  and  aberrant  activation. Also,  adhesion  to  plastic culture dishes might result in cellular activation, degranulation, and reactive oxygen species production resulting in vitro suppression of T cell responses [92].  Activation of large number neutrophils from healthy volunteers has been shown to suppress T cell responses ex vivo [87]. Therefore, at least two possibilities exist on how H O  results in immune sup2 2 pression  in  vivo.  Firstly,  a  general  oxidative  environment described  by  Klemke  et  al.  in  which  'normal'  activated neutrophils  mediate  immune  suppression.  Secondly,  as described below, small amounts of H O  can be delivered 2 2 via the formation of an immunological synapse providing specific and direct suppression of T cell responses. It would be useful to distinguish between these two mechanisms in future  studies  concerning  G-MDSCs  and  neutrophil  suppression by H O . 2 2

Immunological synapse formation, the requirement of cellto-cell contact

The  potency  of  the  above-described  suppressive  mechanisms  would  be  greatly  enhanced  by  cell-to-cell  contact and the formation of an immunological synapse. H O  has 2 2 a short half-life and can be degraded by many endogenous anti-oxidants.  Therefore,  release  into  a  synapse  would potentiate  and  concentrate  local  concentrations  of  H O , 2 2 H2 O 2 is  produced in an immunological synapse between T cells and macrophages and dendritic cells during antigen  presentation,  and  results  in  decreased  lymphocyte activation  [93,  94].  We  have  recently  shown  that  a  subset  of  neutrophils  in  human  inflammation  is  capable  of directly delivering H O  to the surface of lymphocytes and 2 2

thereby  limiting  T  cell  activation  and  proliferation  [29]. This contact was dependent on CD11b/CD18, an integrin abundantly expressed by the G-MDSCs in mice. However, in mice, no requirement of cell-to-cell contact suppression by G-MDSCs was found. A very recent study showed that, in  patients  with  gastric  cancer,  G-MDSCs  isolated  from the tumor site suppressed T cells in a contact-dependent manner [95]. Regretfully, no experiments were performed in  this  latter  study  to  further  elucidate  the  suppressive mechanism.

## Distribution of neutrophils and G-MDSCs in lymphoid organs

In  order  to  modulate  the  function  and  proliferation  of  T cells,  neutrophils  or  G-MDSCs  need  to  come  in  contact with  or  in  close  proximity  to  T  cells  [96].  T  cell  proliferation is normally considered to take place in secondary lymphoid organs such as lymph nodes and the spleen [97]. Recently, T cell proliferation  has  also  been  shown  at  the site  of  inflammation  [98,  99].  In  order  to  suppress  these T cells, neutrophils will have to be present at these sites. Indeed, many studies show neutrophil homing to sites of T cell proliferation, which will be reviewed in the following section.

Neutrophils in lymphoid organs

Spleen

Neutrophils are known to migrate to the spleen under both homeostatic  and  pathological  conditions  [30].  Reinfusion of ex vivo 111 Indium-labeled neutrophils in healthy controls showed the majority of label in the bone marrow, spleen, and liver [30, 100]. These studies imply that considerable amounts  of  neutrophils  rapidly  home  to  the  spleen  after release from the bone marrow. In addition, in mice, about 10 % of reinfused radiolabeled neutrophils migrated towards the spleen, which was not influenced by the maturation status of neutrophils or inflammation [101]. It is important to emphasize that ex vivo manipulation of the cells could have induced subtle changes affecting their homing behavior in vivo [102].

In  the  spleen,  under  normal  homeostatic  conditions, neutrophils reside on the border of the red and white pulp [103, 104] and the marginal zone, whereas T cells are found in the white pulp [103]. Consequently, neutrophils should migrate to the white pulp in order to contact the T cells or vice versa. Neutrophil migration to the white pulp has been shown after intraperitoneal injection of LPS in mice. This was shown to be CD14-dependent [104]. Also, after surgical trauma, neutrophils were found to co-localize with T cells

in the spleen [77]. These data demonstrate that neutrophils migrate towards the T cell zones of the spleen in acute systemic inflammation.

## Lymph nodes

During  inflammation,  neutrophils  are  found  to  migrate to  lymph nodes [17, 105-111]. Already in 1987, neutrophil  trafficking  from  lung  to  draining  lymph  nodes  was described  in  dogs  [1].  In  this  study,  fluorescent  microspheres  were  instilled  in  the  lung  of  dogs  and  phagocytosed by neutrophils and macrophages. After 40 h, almost half  of  the  cells  in  the  draining  lymph  node  were  neutrophils  containing  microspheres  [105]. Also,  in  a  more physiological model of antigen uptake [111], neutrophils can  migrate  to  draining  lymph  nodes  [17,  106].  Neutrophils were detected in lymph nodes during infections with Mycobacterium  bovis [107], Salmonella [108],  and  different parasites [109-111]. In some of these models, neutrophils were shown to alter [17, 111] or even inhibit the inflammatory response [106, 110]. The route of migration toward the lymph nodes [107-111] was via the lymphatic system [17, 105-107, 109].

## Suppressive neutrophils and G-MDSCs in the spleen

Almost  all  studies  regarding  G-MDSCs  in  the  literature were performed with Ly6G-positive cells isolated from the spleen  [31-33].  However,  not  all  of  these  Ly6G-positive neutrophils in the spleen can suppress T cells [43]. An influx of G-MDSCs into the spleen in mice has been seen both in acute and chronic inflammation such as cancer models [31], parasite infection ( Trypanosoma cruzi ) [32], and superantigen stimulation ( Staphylococcal enterotoxin ) [33]. Numbers of  G-MDSCs were increased up to  10-fold  14  days  after Trypanosoma  cruzi infection  [32].  During  superantigen stimulation, suppressive neutrophils with highly segmented nuclei were sorted from the spleen [33]; these cells bear a resemblance  to  the  hypersegmented  CD16 bright /CD62L dim neutrophils that are found in the blood after LPS challenge [29].

Some cancer models increase hematopoiesis, resulting in increased cycling of hematopoietic stem cells and hematopoietic activity in the spleen [112]. Younos et al. showed by in vivo BrdU labeling that in tumor-bearing mice granulocytic  proliferation  mainly  takes  place  in  the  spleen, whereas, in control mice, granulocytic cells predominantly proliferate  in  the  bone  marrow  [113]. The  CD3 + cells  in this model proliferate less in the tumor-bearing mice, but, unfortunately, they do not show that this immune suppression is a direct effect of the spleen granulocytes. There were also  no  microscopic  pictures  of  these  cells  to  show  their maturation stage [113].

Suppressive neutrophils and G-MDSCs in the lymph nodes

Fewer  data  are  available  to  show  suppressive  neutrophils or  G-MDSCs  in  lymph  nodes.  Sepsis  induced  an  influx of  immature  myelocytes  capable  of  T  cell  suppression  in lymph nodes. These cells could be detected 10-14 days after sepsis and remained present in the lymph nodes for at least 12 weeks after sepsis. Cytospins obtained during this study showed a heterogeneous group of cells consisting of both monocytic and granulocytic origin [114].

Vascular  endothelial  growth  factor  (VEGF)  is  able  to induce MDSCs in cancer models and is a factor important for immune evasion in several cancer models [115]. Upon infusion  of  VEGF,  myeloid  cells,  including  neutrophils, were massively increased in lymph nodes [116]. Unfortunately, the capacity of these granulocytes to suppress T cells was not tested. Another indication that MDSCs can migrate to lymph nodes came from a study of Watanabe et al. [117]. They  showed  that  proliferation  of  T  cells  in  the  lymph nodes  of  leukocyte-depleted  mice  was  low  when  injected with spleen cells (containing both T cells and MDSCs) from tumor-bearing mice, compared to proliferation after injection with control mice spleen cells [117]. Proliferation was measured in vitro  using  cells  isolated  from  lymph  nodes. Unfortunately,  this  model  did  not  discriminate  between granulocytic and monocytic MDSCs, so further research is necessary to draw definite conclusions about the presence and importance of suppressive neutrophils in lymph nodes.

## T cell proliferation outside the lymphoid organs

T  cell  proliferation  is  not  restricted  to  lymphoid  organs, because T cell proliferation was also found, e.g., at sites of viral infection [98, 99, 118-121]. In influenza infection, proliferating T cells in the lungs contribute substantially to the total number of cytotoxic T-cells in the lung [98, 118]. Also, the persistence and reactivation of influenza-specific CD8 + memory T-cells can take place in mice without secondary lymphoid organs [119]. Similarly, CD8 + T cells proliferate outside the secondary lymphoid organs in a model of Herpes simplex virus (HSV) reactivation. In this model, infected sensory  dorsal  root  ganglia  (DRGs)  are  transplanted  into naïve  mice,  inducing  proliferation  in  the  DRGs  of  both memory CD8 + T cells from graft [99] and newly recruited CD8 + T  cells  from  the  host  [120].  Even  further,  in  RSV infected mice, CD4 + memory T cells proliferate and differentiate in the lung, but not in the lymph nodes [121].

Taken together, this shows that T cells can proliferate at sites of viral infection, which is exactly the place where vast amounts  of  neutrophils  are  found  [122,  123].  Therefore, although  it  may  contribute,  neutrophil  migration  towards the secondary lymphoid organs is not necessary to dampen the immune response.

Fig. 4 The  origin  of  G-MDSCs  remains  unknown.  Hypothetically, these  calls  can  arise  from  mature  ( 1 )  or  immature  ( 2 )  neutrophils receiving signals to become suppressive. Alternatively, there may be a  dedicated  granulopoiesis,  which  only  produces  suppressive  cells.

## Origin of G-MDSCs and suppressive neutrophils

Many papers have shown only a subset  of  neutrophils  to be  suppressive.  Even  further,  these  suppressive  subsets show differences  in  (flow  cytometric)  expression  patterns and  nuclear  morphology  [28,  29,  44-46].  The  difference between normal neutrophils and the different types of suppressive neutrophils may lie in the presence of cytokines or growth  factors,  (e.g.,  G-CSF  and VEGF)  [115,  116,  124] in  localization,  or  in  their  origin  [28].  Few  studies  have addressed the origin of suppressive phenotypes, and therefore we will briefly discuss four hypotheses regarding the origin(s) of these suppressive cells (Fig. 4):

- (a) Suppressive neutrophils might originate from normal, fully maturated cells. These cells acquire a suppressive phenotype  under  certain  (inflammatory)  conditions. They can either retain their mature nuclear morphology (Fig. 4, 1m) or become hypersegmented (Fig. 4, 1h).
- (b)  Cells do not fully mature before exiting from the bone marrow. Progenitors have been found in the peripheral blood under conditions of severe systemic inflammation caused by infection or trauma [125, 126]. These cells are neutrophil progenitors, which migrate to the tissue and subsequently become suppressive.
- (c) An altered  or  a  dedicated  suppressive  granulopoiesis, underlie  the  production  of  G-MDSCs,  as  suggested

<!-- image -->

This granulopoiesis can take place either in the bone marrow ( 3 )  or extramedullary  ( 4 ).  Additionally,  these  cells  can  be  immature  ( ), i mature ( m ) or hypersegmented ( h )

by the role of G-CSF in several papers [72, 124]. This results in either immature (Fig. 4, 3i) or mature (Fig. 4, 3m) cells with a suppressive phenotype.

- (d)  Instead  of  being  produced  in  the  bone  marrow,  suppressive  cells  might  be  produced  by  extramedullary granulopoiesis.  This  would  result  in  either  immature (Fig. 4, 4i) or mature (Fig. 4, 4m) cells with a suppressive phenotype. For example, Youn et al. [44] described G-MDSCs  from  tumor-bearing  mice  were  produced in  the  spleen,  whereas  neutrophils  from  healthy  mice originated from the bone marrow.

At this moment, it is unclear which of these mechanisms underlie  the  induction  of  G-MDSCs  and  whether  multiple  mechanisms  co-exist.  Further  research  is  required  to elucidate  the  origin  of  different  suppressive  phenotypes, and  whether  differences  between  suppressive  phenotypes are  caused  by  differences  in  their  origin  or  by  alternative activation.

## A novel hypothesis: G-MDSCs are a phenotype of neutrophils

Neutrophils do not belong to a single homogenous population  of  cytotoxic  cells  with  a  sole  function  to  eliminate invading  microorganisms.  In  fact,  these  cells  can  engage

with and modulate T cells and, thereby, shape the adaptive immune system. The lack of consensus regarding nomenclature of these suppressive cells, their heterogeneity, and the lack of suppressive assays in many studies makes it difficult to draw overall conclusions. However, these studies support the hypothesis that multiple types of suppressive neutrophils exist, capable of mediating immune suppression by different  mechanisms.  Given  the  recent  advances  in  neutrophil biology,  illustrating  their  plasticity,  we  hypothesize  that G-MDSCs might be a functional heterogenic subset of neutrophils. At this time, it is uncertain how many neutrophil phenotypes exist. It is, however, clear that targeting neutrophils or G-MDSCs as clinical intervention is only effective with knowledge of the different pro- and anti-inflammatory phenotypes, and when origin and kinetics of these cells are adequately elucidated.
