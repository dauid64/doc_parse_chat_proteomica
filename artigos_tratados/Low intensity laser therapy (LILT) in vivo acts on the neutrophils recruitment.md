Low intensity laser therapy

## a b s t r a c t

It has been suggested that low intensity laser therapy (LILT) acts on pulmonary inflammation. Thus, we investigate in this work if LILT (650 nm, 2.5 mW, 31.2 mW/cm , 1.3 J/cm , laser spot size of 0.08 cm 2 2 2 and irradiation time of 42 s) can attenuate edema, neutrophil recruitment and inflammatory mediators in acute lung inflammation. Thirty-five male Wistar rats ( n = 7 per group) were distributed in the following experimental groups: control, laser, LPS, LPS + laser and dexamethasone + LPS. Airway inflammation was measured 4 h post-LPS challenge. Pulmonary microvascular leakage was used for measuring pulmonary edema. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) cellularity and myeloperoxidase (MPO) were used for measuring neutrophil recruitment and activation. RT-PCR was performed in lung tissue to assess mRNA expression of tumor necrosis factora (TNFa ), interleukin-1 b (IL-1 b ), interleukin (IL-10), cytokineinduced neutrophil chemoattractant-1 (CINC-1), macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2) and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1). Protein levels in both BALF and lung were determined by ELISA. LILT inhibited pulmonary edema and endothelial cytoskeleton damage, as well as neutrophil influx and activation. Similarly, the LILT reduced the TNFa and IL-1 b , in lung and BALF. LILT prevented lung ICAM-1 up-regulation. The rise of CINC-1 and MIP-2 protein levels in both lung and BALF, and the lung mRNA expressions for IL-10, were unaffected. Data suggest that the LILT effect is due to the inhibition of ICAM-1 via the inhibition of TNFa and IL-1 b .

## 1. Introduction

Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a critical illness characterized by acute lung injury (ALI), leading to pulmonary permeability, edema and respiratory failure [1]. There is nonspecific therapy, and mortality caused by this disease still remains high [2]. Circulating neutrophils consideration is important to define both clinical settings and experimental animal models [3].

The mechanism of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) migration in LPS inhaled rats has been partially characterized, it involves airway cells production of inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factora (TNFa ) and interleukin-1 b (IL-1 b ), as well

as neutrophil-specific chemoattractants known as CXC chemokines, which include the family of cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractants (CINCs) and macrophage-inflammatory protein2 (MIP-2), also known as CINC-3 [4]. CD18 integrins have also been shown to play a role on PMN migration. Expression of CD18 adhesion molecules on the PMNs surface can be induced by exposure to LPS or TNFa and to chemokines such as CINC-1 and MIP-2 [5]. In rats, treatment with Abs to CD11a/CD18 or CD11b/CD18, as well as the intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) endothelial cell inhibitor, attenuated the migration of PMNs to intrapulmonary LPS [6].

Traditional treatments of ALI and asthma include a variety of pharmacological corticosteroids, methotrexate, and other disease-modifying agents such as cyclosporine and intravenous immunoglobulin, as well as novel treatments, such as TNFa and IL-1 b [7]. The low intensity laser therapy (LILT) has been used in inflammatory pathologies as a new anti-inflammatory therapy, without provoking side effects [8].

Indeed, LILT has been employed in the treatment of patients with asthma [9]. It have been reported that LILT can relief the late and early symptoms of airway and lung inflammations by reducing the mRNA expression of inflammatory mediators, such as TNFa and IL-1 b [10,11]. Although it is well established that PMNs and inflammatory mediators are important in the development of ALI, the in vivo LILT effect on lung inflammation after stimulation by LPS inhalation is not yet completely explored.

Among the pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators that participate of the development and perpetuation of ALI, there is no enough information about on which mediators of ALI the LILT exerts its anti-inflammatory effect.

Keeping this in mind, the present study was developed specifically to investigate which are the inflammatory mediators that are driven for LILT effect on ALI induced by LPS inhalation.

## 2. Material and methods

## 2.1. Animals

All animal care was in accordance with the guidelines from the Camilo Castelo Branco University (UNICASTELO) for animal care. The experiments were carried out on male Wistar rats weighting 150-180 g each, maintained under standard conditions of temperature (22-25 /C176 C), relative humidity (40-60%) and light/dark cycle with access to food and water ad libitum . The animals were provided by the Central Animal House of the Biomedical Engineer Institute of the Camilo Castelo Branco University (UNICASTELO). All rats were placed in a common box and divided randomly into groups of seven animals each.

## 2.2. Anesthesia

Rats were pre-anesthetized with butorfanol (acepromazine, 0.1 mg/kg) and anesthetized with zoletil (chloridrate of zolazepam, 0.1 mg kg /C0 1 + tiletamine chloridrate, 0.1 mg kg /C0 1 ).

## 2.3. Induction of lung inflammation and dexamethasone treatment

In order to induce the lung inflammation male Wistar rats received inhalation for 10 min of lipopolysaccharide from negativegram bacteria Escherichia coli dissolved in 2 mL saline solution at the concentration of 0.3 mg mL /C0 1 . Briefly, rats ( n = 7 per group) were allocated in a 16 cm side cubic box hermetically closed. An aerosolizator pumps the LPS solution in a controlled manner into box through a hole in the box. For glucocorticoid treatment, the rats were administered with dexamethasone (1 mg kg /C0 1 p.o.) or vehicle (0.5% methylcellulose/0.2% Tween 80 p.o.) 1 h before LPS challenge. Four hours after vehicle or LPS challenge, the inflammatory parameters were analyzed.

## 2.4. LILT

A continuous wave low intensity GaAsAl diode laser (model Thera lase, Brazil) operating in the wavelength of 650 nm was employed. Laser parameters were 2.5 mW output power and laser spot size of 0.08 cm 2 , giving an optical power density of 31.2 mW/cm 2 . Animals were irradiated during 42 s with a laser dose of 1.3 J/cm , 1 h after LPS challenge. The optical power was 2 calibrated by a Newport Multifunction Optical Meter model 1835C. The laser power stability during irradiation was determined collecting light with a partial reflecting mirror (4%). All animals were irradiated on the skin over the upper bronchus at the site of the tracheotomy.

## 2.5. Experimental groups

The experimental groups consisted of 35 male Wistar rats randomly allocated into five groups, named as:

Control - animals challenged with vehicle or saline. with laser.

Laser - animals challenged with vehicle or saline and irradiated LPS - animals challenged with LPS. LPS + laser - animals challenged with LPS and treated with laser. Dexa + LPS - animals pretreated with dexamethasone and chal-

lenged with LPS.

## 2.6. Reagents

Acepromazine, zolazepam chloride and tiletamine chloride were purchased from Cristalia (São Paulo, Brazil). LPS from E. coli serotype 0111:B4 and dexamethasone were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA). The culture medium (RPMI 1640) was obtained from Invitrogen (São Paulo, Brazil) and the reagents for PCR of TNFa , IL-1 b , IL-10, ICAM-1 and chemokines were obtained from R&amp;D Systems (Minneapolis, MN, USA).

## 2.7. Assessment of lung capillary leakage

The extravasated Evans blue dye albumin (EBA) concentration in lung homogenate was calculated against a standard curve using the Evans blue dye. The lung permeability data were expressed as l g g /C0 1 dry weight.

2.8. Isolation of rat pulmonary arterial endothelial cells (RPAECs) and cell culture

Endothelial cells were collected from rat truncus pulmonalis 4 h after inhalation with saline or LPS by digestion with 0.05% collagenase (Biochrom, Berlin, Germany) and cultured in M199 medium (Gibco/Life Technologies, USA), supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 100 mg mL /C0 1 streptomycin, and 100 U/mL penicillin (Sigma, USA) at 37 /C176 C and 5% CO2. Cell monolayers were identified as endothelial cells by a pavement-like appearance in phase contrast microscopy. Cells used for our experiments were taken from the first or second passage; therefore, possible contaminations will have been washed off.

## 2.9. RPAECs damage

Rhodamine-phalloidin staining of a RPAECs monolayer was performed to enable visualization of actin filaments. The PAECs were obtained from rats exposed or not to LPS (0.3 mg mL /C0 1 ). After 4 h of inhalation with LPS, the RPAECs were morphologically analyzed, photographed and counted using a microscope (model Leica DMLB) equipped with an HBO 100 W mercury lamp (model HBO 100 W) and the corresponding filter set for fluorescence microscopy: blue-FITC excitation filter 450-490 nm; barrier 510 nm; emission 520-560 nm. The quantification of RPAECs was done by counting the number of cells in twenty fields randomized chosen and then the mean was calculated. The TNFa level in supernatant of RPAECs culture was determined by ELISA using commercially available kits according to the manufacturer's instructions.

2.10. Quantification of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) cellularity

Four hours after LPS challenge, animals anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (200 mg kg /C0 1 i.p.) were euthanized and the trachea was cannulated. BALF cells were collected from the airway

lumen by flushing the airways with 10 mg kg /C0 1 RPMI 1640 through the tracheal cannula. This procedure was repeated and then made a pool of samples for each animal. Samples were refrigerated for later use. Total cell counts were obtained in BALF samples by using an automated cell counter (Sellex, USA). Cytospins of these samples were prepared by centrifugation of 100 l L aliquots in a cytospin (Sellex, USA) at 700 rpm for 5 min with low acceleration and at room temperature. Slides were fixed and stained on a Hema-tek 2000 (BioRad, USA) with Wright's-Giemsa stain. Cells count was performed following standard morphological criteria and the percentage of neutrophils was determined. The BALF cellularity data were expressed as cells mL /C0 1 .

## 2.11. Lung histology

The organs were fixed in 4% buffered formaldehyde overnight and embedded in paraffin. Three-micrometer lung sections were stained with H&amp;E and examined with a Leica microscope (20 /C2 magnification).

## 2.12. Neutrophil myeloperoxidase (MPO) assay

BALF samples were first processed into cell-free BALF fluid and BALF cell homogenates 4 h after saline or LPS. Cell-free BALF was prepared by sedimenting the cells by centrifugation (400 ) g for 10 min at 4 /C176 C, and then the supernatant was collected and stored. The cell pellets were resuspended in 1 mL of lysis buffer (0.5% hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide in 50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 6.0), and the fraction was designated as BALF cell homogenate. MPO content was determined in BALF fractions using a spectrophotometric reaction with O -dianisidine hydrochloride as a substrate. Briefly, 280 l L of substrate solution (50 mM phosphate buffer containing 0.167 mg mL /C0 1 of O -dianisidine hydrochloride), 10 l L of H2O2 (0.0005%) and 10 l L of sample were added to each covet. The addition of the sample initiated the reaction. Optical density (OD) at 460 nm was monitored after 0.5 s and then every 10 s for 1 min with the initial rate being calculated by the use of the spectrophotometer kinetics module (Hitachi, Japan). The OD change per minute was used as a measure of MPO activity. The peroxidase activity was calculated using a molar extinction coefficient (for the oxidized product of O -dianisidine hydrochloride) of 0.0113 mol cm /C0 1 . MPO data were expressed as units mL /C0 1 .

## 2.13. Lung tissue sampling and processing mediators

After BALF was performed, the thoracic cavity was exposed and, the heart and lung were removed in bloc. The two major lung lobes were dissected out, and the pulmonary vasculature of the lobes was perfused with ice-cold sterile phosphate buffer solution (PBS), using a peristaltic pump (Sellex, USA), for removing the blood poll of cells. Then, lobes were cut into 5-mm pieces using a tissue chopper, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at /C0 80 /C176 C for Real Time-PCR (RT-PCR) analysis of gene expression.

## 2.14. Lung and BALF cytokine and chemokine protein

Pro-inflammatory mediator levels in lung homogenates and BALF were determined by Enzyme Linked Immuno Sorbent Assay (ELISA) using commercially available kits according to the manufacturer's instructions. TNFa was determined by a rat-specific sandwich immunoassay kit obtained from R&amp;D Systems (Minneapolis, MN, USA). IL-1 b and MIP-2 (CINC-3) concentrations were determined using a solid phase sandwich ELISA kit, which used peroxidase and tetramethylbenzidine as a detection method (BioRad, USA). The detection limit of those assays was found to be in the range of 1-5 pg mL /C0 1 . Because of the high similarity in chemo-

kines across species, kits that used polyclonal Abs for the detection of mouse chemokines could also be used to detect the rat cognate provided that a standard curve was obtained using known concentrations of rat chemokines. Thus, CINC levels were assayed using a kit to detect mouse KC (R&amp;D Systems, USA). For lung tissue, cytokine levels were further corrected for protein content using the assay of Lowry. The protein data in BALF or lung tissue were expressed as pg mL /C0 1 .

## 2.15. Lung and cytokine and chemokine mRNA expression

Total cellular RNA from rat lung recovered 4 h post-challenge was isolated by guanidium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform extraction. The polymerase chain reaction was performed on a 7000 Sequence Detection System (ABI Prism, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) employing the SYBRGreen core reaction kit (Applied Biosystems). Real Time-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) was performed with specific primers for rat TNFa 195-305 (GenBank™ accession number X66539) forward primer 5 -AAATGGGCTCCCTCTATCAGTTC-3 and reverse primer 5 -TCTGC0 0 0 TTGGTGGTTTGCTACGAC-3 ; 0 for rat IL-1 b 793-871 (GenBank™ accession number M98820) forward primer 5 -CACCTCTCAA0 GCAGAGCACAG-3 and reverse primer 5 -GGGTTCCATGGTGAAGT0 0 CAAC-3 ; 0 for rat IL-10 195-305 (GenBank™ accession number X66539) forward primer 5 -TGACAATAACTGCACCCACTT-3 and re0 0 verse primer 5 -TCATTCATGGCCTTGTAGACA-3 ; 0 0 for rat CINC-1 195-305 (GenBank™ accession number X66539) forward primer 5 -TGAGCTGCGCAGTCAGTGCCTGCA-3 and reverse primer 5 -ACA0 0 0 CCCTTTAGCATCTTTTGGACA-3 ; for rat 0 MIP-2 195-305 (GenBank™ accession number X66539) forward primer 5 -GGCACAATCGGTAC0 GATCCAG-3 and reverse primer 5 -ACCCTGCCAAGGTTGACTTC-3 ; 0 0 0 for rat ICAM-1 195-305 (GenBank™ accession number X66539) forward primer 5 -AGACACAAGCAAGAGAAAGAAAAGG-3 0 0 and reverse primer 5 -TTGGGAACAAAGGTAGGAATGTAT-3 ; for rat Exon 0 0 (GenBank™ accession number D00475) and rat GAPDH -34743570 (GenBank™ accession number J00691) forward primer 5 0 AAGTCCCTCACCCTCCCAAAAG-3 0 and reverse primer 5 -AAG0 CAATGCTCACCTTCCC-3 0 as control. One microliter of RT reaction was utilized for Real-Time PCR. The PCR primer efficiencies were calculated using standard curves, and the relative expression levels of inflammatory mediators in real time were evaluated applying the 2 CT method, and expressed as the ratio associated to the expression of the housekeeping gene - glyceraldehydes 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH).

## 2.16. Data analysis

Statistical differences were evaluated by analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey-Kramer Multiple Comparisons Test to determine differences between groups. The results were considered significant when p &lt; 0.05.

## 3. Results

## 3.1. Effect of LILT on pulmonary microvascular leakage

Fig. 1A represents the pulmonary edema in response to LPS inhalation. In this assay, we determined vascular permeability in the lung using the Evans blue extravasation technique 4 h after LPS. It is observed that Evans blue extravasation into the lung is significantly higher (66.10 ± 6.0 l g g /C0 1 dry weight) in comparison to control group (11.30 ± 3.70 l g g /C0 1 dry weight), whereas that LILT (28.20 ± 6.10 l g g /C0 1 lung) reduces pulmonary microvascular leakage 4 h after LPS inhalation. LILT inhibition effect is similar to that seen with the synthetic glucocorticoid dexa

Rats were pretreated with dexamethasone (dexa) 1 h before LPS or treated with laser 1 h after LPS. The pulmonary microvascular leakage (A), pulmonary endothelial cytoskeleton damage (B) and the levels of TNFa in culture medium where the pulmonary endothelial cells are cultured (C) were measured 4 h after LPS challenge. Data were expressed as mean ± SEM of eight animals. The results were considered significant when p &lt; 0.05.

(22.50 ± 6.0 l g g /C0 1 dry weight) used as an internal standard. Fig. 1B displays images showing the morphological changes in RPAECs 4 h after LPS inhalation. Control cells show characteristic peripheral bands and close cell-cell contact but, LPS inhalation caused a significant change in this pattern. LPS results in the development of randomly oriented stress fibers, disappearance of peripheral bands and loss of cell to cell contact. The LILT reduced the morphological changes caused by exposure to LPS as it can be seen in Fig. 1B. Furthermore, Fig. 1C represents the participation of TNFa cytokine in LPS-inhalation induced RPAECs cytoskeleton damage in comparison with control group (0.05 ± 0.01 pg mL /C0 1 ). Both laser (0.32 ± 0.07 pg mL /C0 1 ) and dexa (0.20 ± 0.06 pg mL /C0 1 ) reduced the TNFa levels when compared to LPS group (0.75 ± 0.05 pg mL /C0 1 ). Table 1 shows the total counts and percentage of RPAECs 4 h before and after LPS exposure when treated or not with laser. It is observed

that laser irradiation on animals non-challenged with LPS has not effect on pulmonary microvasculature, endothelial cytoskeleton and TNFa level.

## 3.2. Effect of LILT on cell recruitment

A pilot study on LPS dose-response and kinetics was performed (data not shown) to provide a base for further experiment in which the effect of LILT on neutrophil recruitment was investigated. Dose-response studies showed that a LPS concentration of 0.3 mg mL /C0 1 produced significant BALF neutrophilia that was evident at 60 min, reaching a plateau between 2 and 6 h, and returning toward basal level after 24-48 h post-challenge. The LPS dose of 0.3 mg mL /C0 1 aerosolized by 30 min was selected for studying inflammatory indices 4 h after LPS challenge. LPS inhalation (0.87 ± 0.12 /C2 10 6 cells mL /C0 1 ) induces a significant increase in neutrophils counts recovered in BALF as compared to control group (0.02 ± 0.03 /C2 10 6 cells mL /C0 1 ). Treatment with laser (0.31 ± 0.02 /C2 10 6 cells mL /C0 1 ) 1 h after exposure to aerosolized LPS significantly attenuated the number of neutrophils in BALF when compared to LPS group (Fig. 2A). Surprisingly, dexa (0.35 ± 0.02 /C2 10 6 cells mL /C0 1 ) exhibits an inhibition effect that is similar to that observed with laser. Fig. 2B illustrates the neutrophil infiltration into lung after LPS challenge and treatment with LILT or dexamethasone. It is observed that laser irradiation on animals nonchallenged with LPS has not effect on neutrophil influx.

The pulmonary neutrophil infiltration (A) and histological analysis (B) were measured 4 h after LPS challenge. Data were expressed as mean ± SEM of eight animals. The results were considered significant when p &lt; 0.05.

## 3.3. Effect of LILT on myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity in BALF

3.4. Effect of LILT on airway CXC chemokine expression in lung and BALF

In this section we described results about the effect of LILT on the chemokines CINC-1 and MIP-2 that were not shown because

Fig. 3A shows that LPS inhalation induces a remarkable increase in MPO content in BALF cell homogenates (122.3 ± 12.1 unit mL /C0 1 ) in comparison to animals from control group (20.2 ± 10.50 unit mL /C0 1 ), increase that was significantly attenuated by LILT (65.30 ± 10.2 unit mL /C0 1 ). In the same way, dexa (50.45 ± 10.1 unit mL /C0 1 ) also inhibited significantly the LPS effect on neutrophils recruitment. It was found that laser was effective as much as dexa. Wehave also quantified the MPO activity in cell-free BALF as an index of neutrophil degranulation and activation. LPS-induced MPO activity (12.8 ± 1.1 unit mL /C0 1 ) in cell-free BALF was increased when compared to control group (2.18 ± 0.20 unit mL /C0 1 ), which was significantly inhibited by LILT (5.30 ± 1.2 unit mL /C0 1 ) as well as dexa (4.55 ± 1.1 unit mL /C0 1 ) (Fig. 3B). It was found that laser irradiation on animals non-challenged with LPS did not modify the MPO activity in BALF cell homogenates or cell-free BALF.

Rats were pretreated with dexamethasone (dexa) 1 h before LPS or treated with laser 1 h after LPS. MPO activity was measured in BALF cell homogenates to identify the neutrophils recruitment (A) and cell-free BALF to identify the neutrophils activation (B). Data were expressed as mean ± SEM of eight animals. The results were considered significant when p &lt; 0.05.

the LILT was not efficient. Using RT-PCR, it was found that CINC1 expression was barely detectable in lung for the control group (0.15 ± 0.09). Same values were also encountered for control group when chemokine MIP-2 was investigated. After LPS inhalation, the mRNA expression for CINC-1 (1.75 ± 0.10) and MIP-2 (0.75 ± 0.10) were substantially induced in the lungs in comparison to control group. Interestingly, it was also found that 1 h after LPS exposure the LILT did not alter the levels of CINC-1 (1.77 ± 0.15) and MIP-2 (0.74 ± 0.15) mRNA expression. On the contrary, dexa inhibited significantly the mRNA expression in lung of CINC-1 (1.22 ± 0.12) as well as MIP-2 (0.56 ± 0.10) when compared to LPS group.

LPS inhalation releases more MIP-2 than CINC-1 proteins as measured in lung homogenates or BALF. The LPS-induced increases of CINC-1 (85.3 ± 12.2 pg mg /C0 1 protein) and MIP-2 (1750.0 ± 255.20 pg mg /C0 1 protein) in lung homogenates was markedly higher than that for the respective control groups (2.1 ± 0.6 pg mg /C0 1 protein and 250.0 ± 50.10 pg mg /C0 1 protein). The same occurred for these chemokines when they are measured in BALF, in this case LPS increased the concentration both CINC-1 (350.1 ± 25.3 pg mL /C0 1 ) and MIP-2 (10.500 ± 1051.4 pg mL /C0 1 ) when compared to their respective control groups (25.0 ± 2.2 pg mL /C0 1 and 500.0 ± 350.3 pg mL /C0 1 , respectively). CINC-1 (81.60 ± 12.1 pg mg /C0 1 protein) and MIP-2 (1548.5 ± 225.1 pg mg /C0 1 protein) proteins in

lung homogenates were unaffected by laser irradiation, which is consistent with the mRNA expression data. The laser was also inefficient for reducing CINC-1 (347.6 ± 22.1 pg mL /C0 1 ) and MIP-2 (10.482 ± 1055.1 pg mL /C0 1 ) chemokines in BALF. Unlike LILT, dexa significantly inhibited lung protein for CINC-1 (55.3 ± 12.0 pg mg /C0 1

protein) and MIP-2 (766.10 ± 55.10 pg mg /C0 1 protein) and marginally inhibited BALF protein expression for the chemokines CINC-1 and MIP-2 (275.7 ± 22.0 pg mL /C0 1 and 7350.2 ± 1055.2 pg mL /C0 1 , respectively). Laser irradiation on animals non-challenged with LPS has not effect on chemokines.

## 3.5. Effect of LILT on airway cytokine expression

We evaluated the TNFa in vivo by assessing the lung TNFa mRNA expression and the accumulation of TNFa protein in lung and BALF. As demonstrated in Fig. 4A, there was a large increase in lung TNFa mRNA (1.70 ± 0.10) in response to LPS inhalation when compared to control group (0.15 ± 0.09). In this condition, laser irradiation (0.74 ± 0.15) reduced the induction of TNFa mRNA expression, which was significant at 1 h after LPS inhalation; in the same way Dexa also reduced the TNFa mRNA expression (0.66 ± 0.10). Consistent with the up-regulated lung (57.80 ± 23.10 pg mg /C0 1 protein) and BALF (215.40 ± 83.10 pg mL /C0 1 ), the levels for TNFa were also inhibited after LILT for both lung (17.20 ± 3.15 pg mg /C0 1 protein) and BALF (66.10 ± 23.15 pg mL /C0 1 ) in comparison to the respective LPS groups, as it is shown in Fig. 4B and C, respectively. Dexa was also efficient in reducing protein in lung homogenates (12.50 ± 3.10 pg mg /C0 1 protein) and BALF (62.50 ± 20.10 pg mL /C0 1 ) for TNFa .

As demonstrated in Fig. 5A, there was a marked increase in lung IL-1 b mRNA (1.90 ± 0.10) in response to LPS challenge when compared to control group (0.12 ± 0.09). Moreover, LPS inhalation also induced IL-1 b protein (1533.10 ± 321.20 pg mg /C0 1 protein) expression in lung homogenates (Fig. 5B) and BALF (205.60 ± 80.20 pg mL /C0 1 ) (Fig. 5C), which was significantly inhibited by LILT (550.20 ± 122.20 pg mg /C0 1 protein and 57.30 ± 10.20 pg mL /C0 1 , respectively). The levels of inhibition achieved by LILT were similar to those obtained with Dexa.

We also studied the LILT effect on the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 after LPS inhalation (data not shown). The mRNA expression of IL-10 post-LPS (1.65 ± 0.60) was significantly higher in comparison to that from animals of control group (0.10 ± 0.09). Unlike dexa (0.32 ± 0.12), LILT (1.62 ± 0.61) did not modify the expression of this cytokine after LPS challenge. It is observed that laser irradiation on animals non-challenged with LPS has not effect on cytokines when compared to control group.

## 3.6. Effect of LILT on lung ICAM-1 expression

Considering the effect of laser irradiation on recruitment and activation of neutrophils, we postulated that the beneficial effect of LILT might occur through the ability of the laser to prevent lung ICAM-1 mRNA expression. There is a constitutive expression ICAM-1 mRNA which was significantly up-regulated after LPS challenge (1.65 ± 0.60) when compared to control group (0.10 ± 0.09) (Fig. 6). Furthermore, it is reasonable to suppose that LILT modulates the up-regulated ICAM-1 mRNA expression, because there was a significant difference in lung ICAM-1 mRNA expression with

Lung samples were harvested 4 h post-LPS challenge. Data were expressed as mean ± SEM of eight animals. The results were considered significant when p &lt; 0.05.

(0.47 ± 0.15) and without LILT (1.65 ± 0.60). Dexa (0.32 ± 0.12) was also effective in the reduction of ICAM-1 mRNA expression in comparison to the group not treated. Fig. 6 shows that laser irradiation on animals non-challenged with LPS has effect on ICAM-1 expression, as it can be seen when compared to control group.

## 4. Discussion

This is the first report that describes specific effects of LILT on pulmonary inflammation, adhesion molecule, mRNA expression and protein level of inflammatory chemokines in a model of ALI in rat aerosolized with LPS. Otherwise, CINC, MIP-2 chemokines, which are inducers of neutrophil recruitment, and IL-10 were not altered by LILT neither in BALF nor lung.

Considering the LILT anti-inflammatory effect on pulmonary microvascular leakage is reasonable suggesting that the action mechanism of the laser therapy in ALI model involves the participation of endothelial cytoskeleton that is the molecular motor that drives non-muscle actin cytoskeleton rearrangement. In fact, Mafra de Lima and co-workers [12] evidenced that the endothelial cell damage is decreased after LILT in a model of acute lung injury induced by E. coli lipopolysaccharide in the rat. Herein, the attenuation of the pulmonary endothelial cytoskeleton damage suggests a modulatory action of the LILT on LPS-inhalation induced-ALI through a signaling pathway that involves TNFa since that the laser irradiation reduced the TNFa levels collected from the supernatant of culture medium of RPAECs. This result is very interesting because showed that laser irradiation is able to reach lung structures closely involved with the vascular permeability.

LPS inhalation induces a remarkable neutrophilic inflammation as assessed by BALF cellular profile and MPO content in BAL cell homogenates collected 4 h post-inhalation. That increase in neutrophil count and MPO activity was abrogated by LILT. The histological analysis in lung also proves the beneficial effect of LILT. Laser produced a comparable degree of inhibition that is comparable to that produced by the synthetic glucocorticosteroid dexamethasone; this is in agreement with published data [13]. MPO activity in cell-free BALF, used as an index of neutrophil degranulation, was significantly inhibited by laser. Then, data show that LILT provided a significant protection against LPS-induced neutrophil recruitment and activation.

Data in the present work reinforce the idea previously described for us that the cellular signaling responsible by LILT anti-inflammatory effect on ALI induced post-LPS challenge is specifically driven to pro-inflammatory cytokines TNFa and IL-1 b . Moreover the LILT attenuated the alterations of bronchial smooth muscle reactivity induced directly by TNFa [14]. Still on this context, Aimbire and co-workers [15] reported that LILT restores trachea muscle relaxation response in rats with TNFa -mediated smooth airway muscle dysfunction by increasing cAMP levels.

Regarding to IL-1 b and TNFa mRNA expression, LILT reduced the expression of these pro-inflammatory mediators as well as protein in lung [11,16]. Although in the condition mentioned above the rat ALI had been induced by LPS, the results obtained herein are not a repetition from those already reported, since in the present study we used a model of pulmonary inflammation in which the animals were aerosolized with LPS. Thus, it is important to stand out that the model used herein permit that LPS attained principally the airway and lung. It guarantees that the observed alterations were completely dependent of cells and mediators activated directly on the respiratory tract.

Interestingly, we showed that the inhibition of LPS-induced neutrophilic lung inflammation by LILT is not achieved through modulation of the mRNA expression of the neutrophil chemotactic factors CINC-1 and MIP-2 (CINC-3). Our data further suggest that

laser effect on chemokines may not be necessary to attenuate the neutrophilia and that additional mechanisms may be responsible for this effect on neutrophil influx in this model of airway inflammation.

Considering the balance between the anti- and pro-inflammatory cytokines in the control of ALI, it is known that IL-10 is among the most potent anti-inflammatory agents induced in response to LPS [17]. The LILT effect on IL-10 in ALI has been not investigated yet. We have therefore examined the potential contribution of IL10 and its sensitivity to modulation by LILT. In the present study, the LPS-induced up-regulated expression of lung IL-10 was not modified by laser treatment, discarding the contribution of this pathway to the protective effect of LILT. On the contrary, dexamethasone significantly reduced lung IL-10 mRNA expression.

Several studies have demonstrated the ability of IL-10 to downregulate LPS-inducible mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines partly through the inhibition of NFj B [18]. Curiously, Mafra de Lima and co-workers [16] showed that LILT reduced the TNFa -induced rat bronchial cholinergic hyperresponsiveness through a NFj B dependent mechanism. In the same sense, we reported that pulmonary apoptotic neutrophils from rats inflamed with LPS injection were reduced by the LILT and that the laser effect on apoptotic neutrophils was abolished post treatment with NFj B inhibitor [19].

Another mechanism by which LPS promotes ALI is by up-regulating the expression of adhesion molecules on endothelial cells and circulating leukocytes [20]. ICAM-1 has been shown to be a requirement for neutrophil recruitment into airway with peak levels of expression associated with maximum leukocyte adherence [21]. LILT abrogated ICAM-1 mRNA expression to a level similar to that produced by Dexa. Therefore, it is likely that the diminished ICAM-1 expression by LILT may have contributed to the impaired neutrophil recruitment. Our data suggest that the inhibitory effect of LILT on neutrophil influx and lung ICAM-1 mRNA expression may be achieved, at least partly, through the inhibition of lung and BALF TNFa protein and/or mRNA expression.

An interesting point to be considered here is that the LILT beneficial effect was achieved in our experiment with only one irradiation post-LPS. Future studies need to be done to elucidate if the beneficial effects of LILT on ALI could be better when the laser is applied in a dosing regimen.

Regarding the LILT dosimetry, we should emphasize that one of the questions that preclude the wide employment of this therapy for several pathologies is the difficulty in obtaining the exact laser dose and irradiation time to reach the maximal efficiency of this methodology. In many cases, the same wavelength, energy density and time of irradiation of LILT may be efficient for an inflammatory process and inefficient for other.

Finally, it is important to stand out that LILT treatment attenuated the LPS-induced ALI, but it does not lead to a complete inhibition of lung injury. Because of that, this therapy can be applicable as a therapeutic modality for ARDS, but with a limited protection. That reinforces the idea of using LILT concomitant to other pharmacological agents.

## 5. Conclusion

Red LILT with wavelength of 650 nm and a single dose of 1.3 J/ cm 2 administered in vivo 1 h after LPS aerosol inhibited pulmonary edema and neutrophilic inflammation. Therefore, LILT may be a useful therapy in lung pathologies in which TNFa and IL-1 b productions are the predominant mediators. Further studies are warranted in this novel area in order to elucidate the exact mechanism of action of LILT in acute lung inflammation.
