Whereas mobilization to inflammatory sites is an important function of neutrophils, it remains to be determined whether granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF) stimulates the mobilization of neutrophils to the inflammatory sites. This study compared the expression of more than 9000 genes in neutrophils treated with and without G-CSF with the use of a DNA microarray system to determine the

effects of G-CSF on the function of neutrophils. It was found that messenger RNA expression of epithelial cell-derived neutrophil attractant-78 (ENA-78), which has been reported to be a chemotactic factor for neutrophils, was induced by G-CSF in neutrophils. The study demonstrated that the supernatant of G-CSF-treated neutrophils induced the chemotaxis of neutrophils and that anti-ENA-78 antibody and

In this study, we sought to demonstrate the effects of G-CSF on the function of neutrophils with the use of a DNA microarray system. By comparing the expression of more than 9000 genes by screening messenger RNAs (mRNAs) extracted from untreated neutrophils and those treated with G-CSF in vitro, we found that epithelial cell-derived neutrophil attractant-78 (ENA-78) pressed 17-fold higher in the neutrophils treated with G-CSF than in those untreated.

Tokyo, Japan). The probed membrane was then washed and exposed to radiographic film. cDNA fragments for ENA-78 were amplified by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, cloned into a TA cloning vector, and then used as probes for Northern blot assay. Polymerase chain reaction primers were as follows: ENA-78 forward, GGTTGGATGCTCTTGTCCAA; reverse, CCTTCCAGAAAGTCTTCTAT.

## Flow-activated cell sorter analysis

After staining with anti-CXCR-2 antibody and fluorescence-conjugated second antibody, the cells were analyzed with a FACScaliber (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA).

## Transwell chamber assay

For examination of the chemotactic activities in the supernatants neutrophils, the Transwell chamber (Coster, Cambridge, MA) assay was performed according to the previously described method.rnatants 15 Supe were prepared by incubating the neutrophils for 24 hours after incubation with G-CSF for 24 hours and washing them twice with RPMI-1640 medium. Supernatants (600L) diluted to 20% and neutrophils suspended m in 100 m L RPMI-1640 medium were placed in the lower and upper chambers, respectively. After 4 to 8 hours of incubation, transmigrated cells in the lower chambers were counted under an inverted microscope at least

The untreated neutrophils and those treated with 10 ng/mL G-CSF for 24 hours were stained with anti-CXCR-2 antibody and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated second antibody and then analyzed for expression of CXCR-2 with a FACScaliber. Representative result of 2 different experiments is shown. (C) Chemotaxis of neutrophils stimulated by conditioned medium of neutrophils. Supernatants of neutrophils treated with or without G-CSF (G 1 or G 2 , respectively) at 10 ng/mL were placed at 20% in the lower chambers. Anti-ENA-78 or anti-CXCR-2 antibody was added in the lower chambers at 2 m g/mL. Recombinant ENA-78 (10 ng/mL) was used as a positive control. Results are presented as percentage of numbers of transmigrated neutrophils treated with G CM. Data present the mean 6 SD of 3 different experiments.

## Results and discussion

## Differentially expressed genes

One hundred twenty-two and 50 genes, including EST clones, were expressed 2-fold and 3-fold higher, respectively, in the neutrophils treated with G-CSF than in those untreated. Table 1 shows 37 known genes among those expressed 3-fold higher in the neutrophils treated with G-CSF than in those untreated. In particular, ENA-78 and granulocyte chemotactic protein-2 (GCP-2), which were reported to be chemotactic factors for neutrophils, 11,12,16,17 were expressed 17-fold and 4-fold higher, respectively, neutrophils treated with G-CSF than in those untreated. Previous reports demonstrated that mast cells, nonsmall cell lung cancer cells, monocytes, and osteosarcoma cells produced ENA-78 and GCP-2, respectively, whereas there has been no report demonstrating the production of ENA-78 and GCP-2 by neutrophils. 18,19 12,16, Therefore, we focused on these molecules in this study. Urokinasetype plasminogen activator, which has been reported to play an important role in the recruitment of neutrophils to the inflammatory sites, was 20 also expressed 16.5-fold higher in the treated with G-CSF than in those untreated. The role of plasminogen activator is now under examination.

## ENA-78 mRNA expression and chemotaxis of neutrophils

receptor for ENA-78, was expressed at the same level both on the neutrophils treated with and without G-CSF. As shown in Figure 1C, chemotaxis of neutrophils enhanced by recombinant ENA-78 was abrogated by anti-ENA-78 and anti-CXCR-2 antibodies. Chemotaxis was also enhanced by the supernatants of the G-CSFtreated neutrophils. Reversely, anti-ENA-78 and anti-CXCR-2 antibodies abrogated the enhanced chemotaxis. These results indicate that the neutrophils stimulated by G-CSF secrete ENA-78 and consequently stimulate the chemotaxis of neutrophils, suggesting that neutrophils accumulated in the inflammatory sites secrete ENA-78 and then augment the accumulation of neutrophils when treated with G-CSF.

in the neutrophils Several previous reports demonstrating that the chemotaxis of neutrophils was decreased by the treatment with G-CSF seem to be inconsistent with our present result.ver, in those previous 8,9 Howe studies they examined the chemotaxis of newly developed neutrophils after the in vivo treatment with G-CSF; it is not surprising that the chemotaxis of newly developed immature neutrophils was low. In contrast, we demonstrated that the treatment with G-CSF induced the production of a chemotactic factor, ENA-78, in the neutrophils. Our present results, in combination with the findings of survival-inducing activity of G-CSF, suggest that G-CSF is effective for the treatment of infection through the augmentation of the neutrophil accumulation in the inflammatory sites in addition to the increase of neutrophils and the activation of effector functions.

As shown in Figure 1A, the untreated neutrophils did not express ENA-78 mRNA, but the neutrophils treated with G-CSF expressed ENA-78 mRNA. ENA-78 mRNA expression was induced by G-CSF in a dose-dependent manner (data not shown). mRNA expression of GCP-2 was not observed in the treated or untreated hank Kyowa Hakko for providing the G-CSF and Ms M. neutrophils (data not shown).
