The ability of polymorphonuclear neutrophils "PMN# to produce and release numerous pro!in~ammatory cytokines is now established and play an important role in triggering and maintaining the in~ammatory response[ We studied the autocrine downregulation of this process by investigating the potential production by human PMN of two major anti!in~ammatory cytokines\ interleukin 09 "IL!09# and IL!02[

The authors| PMN puri\_cation method\ based in part on immunomagnetic depletion\ allows the elimination of all cells known to produce those two cytokines[ A wide range of activation conditions were tested and kinetic studies were done[ IL!09 and IL!02 proteins were not detected in culture supernatants or cell lysates of PMN from 02 healthy volunteers[ This was con\_rmed by the absence of IL!09 and IL!02 mRNA expression\ as shown by RT!PCR[ Human PMN thus seem unable to produce or release two of the most potent anti!in~ammatory cytokines\ IL!09 and IL!02[ This could partly account for the persistence of local in~ammation\ where PMN are the main in\_ltrating cells[

## Lack of IL !09 and IL !02 production by PMN

Cytokines were measured in the cell!free supernatants of PMN from 02 healthy volunteers[

TNF! # did not induce IL!09 or IL!02 production by a PMN\ even in the presence of protease inhibitors in the culture medium[

Various other stimuli such as formyl peptide "fMLP#\ opsonized and non!opsonized zymosan\ PAF\ LTB3\ phorbol myristate acetate "PMA# and recombi! nant cytokines "IL!0 b \ IL!5\ IL!7\ IL!3\ IL!09\ IL!02\ TGF! \ LIF\ oncostatin M\ KGF# were added to PMN b from three donors\ at concentrations described in the literature to induce mediator synthesis[ The culture supernatants harvested after 3GLYPH&lt;1&gt;61 h did not contain detectable IL!09 or IL!02[ In particular IL!09 did not induce IL!02 production nor IL!02 induce IL!09 production[

Membrane!associated and intracellular stored IL!09 and IL!02 were tested for after treatment of the cultures with CHAPS[ We again failed to detect IL!09 and IL!02 in all the stimulation conditions "agents and time points# described above[

This absence of IL!09 from the supernatants and lysates of PMN cultures was con\_rmed by using 3 di}erent commercial kits with various sensitivities\ speci\_cities "viral or human IL!09# and standardization[

In parallel\ autologous monocytes and lympho! cytes from three donors\ isolated and cultured on the same day as PMN\ were shown to produce IL!09 and IL!02[ For example\ lipopolysaccharide "LPS# "099 ng: ml# induced 5159 2 719 pg of IL!09:ml:4 GLYPH&lt;29&gt; 09 4 mono! cytes after 07 h of culture^ phytohaemagglutinin "PHA# "0 mg:ml# plus PMA "09 ng:ml# induced 195 2 44 and 1499 2 312 pg of IL!02:ml:4 GLYPH&lt;29&gt; 09 4 lymphocytes after 13 and 37 h of culture\ respectively[

## RT PCR analysis of cytokine mRNA expression ! by PMN and control cells

To con\_rm the absence of IL!09 and IL! 02 production by cultured PMN\ we studied the mRNA expression of the two cytokines by means of RT!PCR[ RNA from highly puri\_ed PMN was reverse!transcribed and the resulting cDNA was ampli\_ed with speci\_c primers for b !actin\ IL!09\ IL!02 and IL!7[ Typical results obtained with PMN from 2 healthy donors are similar to those shown in Figure 1[

As expected "Fig[ 1A#\ monocytes stimulated by LPS "0 m g:ml# expressed IL!09 mRNA after 07 h\ as shown by the presence of a 217!bp product obtained after ampli\_cation with speci\_c primers[ No band corresponding to IL!09 was observed in untreated or activated PMN\ whatever the stimulus[

As shown in Figure 1B\ IL!02 mRNA was never detected in PMN in any conditions of stimulation\ while IL!02 mRNA was strongly evidenced as a 152!bp product in IL!02!transfected CHO cells and PMA! stimulated lymphocytes as expected[

## DISCUSSION

This study indicates that highly puri\_ed human PMN from healthy donors are incapable of producing and releasing the anti!in~ammatory cytokines IL!09 and IL!02 in the numerous in vitro conditions tested[ The lack of mRNA expression and protein release was observed despite a wide range of stimuli and incubation times "3GLYPH&lt;1&gt;61 h#[ In addition\ unstimulated PMN did not store IL!09 or IL!02 intracellularly[ As IL!09 and IL!02 have a pivotal role in negative regulation of pro!in~ammatory cytokine production by monocytes and PMN themselves\ the lack of IL!09 and IL!02 production by PMN could sustain and:or enhance local in~ammation in pathological situations where PMN are the major in\_ltrating cells[

The procedure used for PMN isolation allowed us to obtain highly puri\_ed PMN with less than 9[0) of contaminating cells[ Preliminary studies performed with PMN suspensions isolated by means of classical methods "dextran sedimentation followed by Ficoll centrifugation# and containing 0 to 1) of monocytes and lymphocytes showed detectable production of

IL!09 and IL!02 "data not shown#[ Immunomagnetic depletion of contaminating cells led to the disappear! ance of both cytokines[ We used anti!HLA class II!coated magnetic beads\ which bind to monocytes\ activated T and B lymphocytes but not to resting PMN^ indeed\ expression of HLA class II molecules on PMN has only been described after stimulation by IFN! g or GM!CSF[ 01\02 This is the \_rst report involving such a puri\_cation method[ The presence of various proportions of monocytes and lymphocytes in PMN suspensions obtained by classical isolation procedures could explain con~icting reports on PMN production of cytokines[ For example\ some authors have described inducible IL!5 production by PMN\ 03 while others failed to detect IL!5 in similar conditions of isolation and stimulation[ 0\6 More recently\ Romani et al [ found IL!09 production by mice PMN only in the presence of protease inhibitors in the cultures[ 04 In our hands\ the addition of such protease inhibitors did not allow the detection of IL!09 in human PMN cultures[ The di}erence between these results and ours may be thus probably due to the degree of PMN puri\_cation[

Leukocyte di}erential counts were performed on whole blood prior to isolation in all the donors\ in order to eliminate the eosinophil! or basophil!rich blood[ Indeed\ constitutive expression of IL!09 mRNA by eosinophils from healthy donors has recently been detected by means of in situ hybridization and RT!PCR[ 05\06 In the same way\ IL!02 production in response to various stimuli has been shown in human basophils[ 07\08\19

We tested a wide range of stimuli corresponding to di}erent mechanisms of cell activation[ LPS combined with pro!in~ammatory cytokines\ a type of stimulus known to upregulate cytokine gene expression and protein production in PMN\ failed to yield detectable IL!09 or IL!02 protein or mRNA ex! pression[ We con\_rmed that LPS plus IFN! g or GM!CSF was the most powerful inducer of PMN production of IL!7\ or TNF! a as previously described by others 0\10 and IL!09 production by monocytes[ 11 We were also unsuccessful in triggering IL!09 or IL!02 production by using other known PMN activators such as PMA\ 12 fMLP\ C4a and platelet!activating factor "PAF#\ 0 untreated yeast and yeast opsonized with IgG\ 13 and leukotriene B3[ 14 Finally\ as it has been reported that IL!3 induces IL!02 production by T lymphocytes\ 15 that IL!02 promotes IL!0Ra production by PMN 16 and soluble type II IL!0 receptor shedding from the PMN surface\ 3 and that IL!09 can increase IL!Ra production by monocytes 17 and PMN\ 1\8 we investigated whether anti!in~ammatory cytokines such as IL!3\ IL!09 and IL!02 could induce IL!09 or IL!02 production by PMN[ Negative results were always obtained[ In all these experiments LPS!stimulated monocytes\ and IL!02!transfected CHO cells or

PHA!stimulated lymphocytes\ were used as positive controls for IL!09 and IL!02 production\ respectively[

Kinetic studies between 3 and 61 h failed to give positive results[The kinetics of production of the two cytokines depended on the cell source[ Maximal IL!02 production is obtained after 13 h of basophil culture\ while IL!02 production by T lymphocytes continues to increase over a 61!h period[ 07GLYPH&lt;1&gt;19\15 Similarly\ IL!09 mRNA expression is di}erent in eosinophils 05 and monocytes[ 11

As some cytokines and cytokine receptors are stored within cells\ e[g[ IL!09 and IL!3 in eosinophils\ 05 TNF in mastocytes\ 18 TNF receptors in neutrophils 4 and IL!0 a in monocytes\ 29 we tested for cell!associated IL!09 and IL!02 in PMN[ IL!09 and IL!02 were not detected in PMN lysates[

To further con\_rm the absence of IL!09 protein from PMN culture supernatants and lysates\ most of the assays were performed using four di}erent commercial ELISAs with various antibodies\ and were all unsuccessful[

This study therefore shows that human neu! trophils activated in vitro by numerous stimuli are unable to produce two of the most important anti!in~ammatory cytokines\ IL!09 and IL!02[ PMN have been shown to synthesize or release negative regulators of pro!in~ammatory cytokines\ such as IL!0RA\ 1 soluble receptors for IL!0 3 and TNF\ 4 which speci\_cally target these cytokines\ while IL!09 and IL!02 are able to inhibit the synthesis of a much wider range of pro!in~ammatory cytokines\ and to induce the synthesis of cytokine inhibitors such as IL0Ra[ 1\8 TGF! \ which is also produced by PMN\ seems to be b less powerful than IL!09 and IL!02 in inhibiting the release of pro!in~ammatory cytokines by monocytes\ as stimulation with high concentrations of LPS cannot be overcome by TGF! b "personal data\ Ref[ 20#[

The absence of IL!09 and IL!02 production by PMN\ which could not a}ord for a negative autocrine:paracrine regulation of pro!in~ammatory cytokines released by the cells present at the in~ammatory site\ is of major importance[ Even though monocytes make larger amounts of cytokines than PMN at the single!cell level "reviewed in Ref[ 0#\ PMN compose the majority of in\_ltrating cells at sites of early in~ammation and may thus represent a major local source of pro!in~ammatory cytokines[

These \_ndings are in keeping with our previous clinical studies[ Patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome "ARDS# or severe pneumonia have massive pulmonary PMN in\_ltration^ yet we failed to detect IL!09 protein in bronchoalveolar lavage ~uid from these patients\ 21 or in alveolar PMN culture super! natants\ 22 while TNF! a \ IL!5 and IL!7 were present in large amounts in the lung and correlated with the degree of lung injury[

mike;*CYTO 09:2 "ISSUE# "735633#*MS 9074

In addition to their negative role in the regulation of pro!in~ammatory cytokines\ IL!09 and IL!02 have been reported to inhibit the generation of procoagulant activity in monocytes\ to modulate endothelial cell adhesion molecule expression\ to decrease nitric oxide production by macrophages and to downregulate the cytotoxic activity of monocytes[ 7 Therefore\ the absence of IL!09 and IL!02 production by PMN in\_ltrating in~amed tissues could participate in the induction and persistence of in~ammatory lesions[

In conclusion\ PMN are now considered as central elements in the in~ammatory response\ participating in the regulation of the immune response via the production of numerous cytokines[ The fact that human PMN do not seem to be able to produce two of the main anti!in~ammatory cytokines\ IL!09 and IL!02\ raises the possibility that other yet unde\_ned controls of in~ammatory processes are taking place in pathological situations where PMN are the major in\_ltrating cells[
