## Abstract

Neutrophils are recruited rapidly to sites of infection in response to host- and/or microbe-derived proinflammatory molecules. At such sites, neutrophils phagocytose microbes and are activated to produce superoxide and other reactive oxygen species (ROS). In addition, neutrophils contain stores of antimicrobial peptides and enzymes that work in concert with ROS to kill ingested microbes. Neutrophils can also release chromosomal DNA bound with antimicrobial peptides and enzymes to form web-like structures known as extracellular traps. Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) have been reported to ensnare and kill microbes and are commonly considered to be an important component of innate host defense. Notably, the formation of NETs is most often reported as a cytolytic process. Whereas intraphagosomal killing of microbes sequesters cytotoxic antimicrobial molecules that would otherwise damage host tissues, the formation of NETs and associated extracellular release of these molecules can contribute to host tissue destruction and disease. Here we compare and contrast phagocytosis and NETs in host defense, with emphasis on recent studies of NETs that ultimately underscore the importance of phagocytosis as the primary means by which neutrophils eliminate microbes.

## Introduction

Neutrophils  are  the  most  abundant  leukocytes  in  human  blood, and  their central role in innate defense  against infection is unequivocal.  The  processes  that  recruit  neutrophils  to  sites  of microbe  invasion,  phagocytosis,  and  coupling  of  the  engulfment  process  to  rapid deployment  of  oxygen-dependent  and oxygen-independent  mechanisms  for  efficient  microbe  killing and  digestion  have  been  studied  extensively.  Many  fundamental insights into these neutrophil processes have arisen from studies  of  human  patients  and  bacterial  and  fungal  pathogens to  inhibit  or  coopt  these  defense  processes  to  evade  elimination while also causing tissue destruction and disease.

## Phagocytosis, phagocytic killing, and neutrophil extracellular traps

Phagocytosis is a specialized form of receptor-mediated endocytosis  that  is  utilized  by  neutrophils  and  macrophages  to ingest  particles  and  microbes  that  are  at  least  0.5  microns  in size . 1 The list of phagocytic receptors continues to grow and  includes molecules  that bind directly to microbes  such CEACAMs, lectins, and integrins as well as receptors that engage microbes opsonized with IgG or complement fragments 2 . In  all  cases,  signaling  downstream  of  these  receptors triggers local actin polymerization that is essential for extension  of  membrane  pseudopodia  around  the  microbe  and its internalization.

A distinguishing feature of neutrophils is the fact that phagocytic receptor signaling also elicits rapid deployment of oxidative  and  non-oxidative  host  defense  mechanisms  via simultaneous  assembly  and  activation  of  the  Nox2-containing NADPH  oxidase  complex  and  mobilization of specific and azurophilic granules.  As a result, phagosome-granule  fusion and  the  production  of  superoxide  anions  and  other  toxic  ROS is  typically  apparent  within  60  seconds  of  particle  or  microbe binding 3-5 . The  speed  and  efficiency  of  this  process  creates  a highly  lethal  milieu  in  the  phagosome  lumen  that  consists  of oxidants,  cationic  antimicrobial  peptides,  iron  binding  proteins, and  enzymes  such  as  elastase and  myeloperoxidase  (MPO). The  formation  of  such  an  environment  is  in  keeping  with  the ability  of  neutrophils  to  kill  the  majority  of  ingested  microbes within 30 minutes 6-8 . By  contrast, phagosome  maturation  in macrophages is relatively slow and consists of incremental modification  of  nascent  phagosomes  via  sequential  interaction with early endosomes, late endosomes, and lysosomes 9 .

The  importance  of  NADPH  oxidase-derived  ROS  to  microbe killing  is  exemplified  by  the  life-threatening  infections  that  arise in  patients  who  have  inherited  mutations  in  genes  that  encode subunits  of  this  enzyme  complex 10 . Pathogens  that  evade  killing by  neutrophils inhibit or evade  toxic ROS  and  achieve this by inhibiting NADPH  oxidase targeting, assembly, or activity 11-14 . Less  is  known  about  the  mechanisms  that  control oxygen-independent defense mechanisms, including granule targeting and fusion, but recent data indicate that distinct Rab27-independent  and -dependent mechanisms  control azurophilic granule  fusion with  phagosomes  and  the  plasma

membrane, respectively 15 . Additional insight will likely be gleaned from  further  studies  of  pathogens  that  manipulate  phagosome fusion  with  specific  and/or  azurophilic  granules  as  part  of  their virulence strategies . 2

The  discovery of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs)  suggested  the  existence  of  an  additional  mechanism  that  allows neutrophils to trap and/or kill extracellular microbes 16 . In a landmark  study,  Brinkmann et  al .  reported  that  some  activated neutrophils  release  decondensed  chromatin  fibers  as  web-like structures  to  which  cationic  neutrophil  proteins  such  as  elastase, histones, and MPO are bound 16 . These structures-aptly named  NETs-can  ensnare  and  kill  microorganisms.  Subsequent work by the same group of researchers reported a mechanism  for  the  formation  of  NETs  that  requires  ROS  and,  more notably,  is  a  cytolytic  process 17 . The  formation  of  NETs  that results  from  neutrophil  lysis  was  proposed  as  a  novel  cell  death program ultimately termed NETosis 17,18 . The formation of NETs  and NETosis have often been used as synonymous terms  for  years,  but  whether  the  formation  of  NETs  is  always  a result  of  the  cytolytic  process  described  as  NETosis  has  been called  into  question 19,20 . Indeed,  NETs  can  form  from  viable neutrophils 21-23 or from neutrophils that have undergone non-specific  lysis 24 .  Thus,  there  is  reasonable  agreement  in  the field  that  the  term  'NETosis'  should  not  be  used  to  describe the  formation  of  NETs  unless  a  specific  cell  death  mechanism is known 19,25,26 .

NETs have been studied extensively since the report by Brinkmann et  al ., and  it  is  clear  they  can  contribute  to  host defense. For example, Urban et  al . 27 and  Branzk et  al . 28 reported that NETs  are  important  for host defense against microbes that cannot  be  phagocytosed,  such  as  fungi  in  hyphal  form. More  recently,  Thanabalasuriar et  al . demonstrated  that  NETs prevent dissemination of Pseudomonas aeruginosa from biofilms  in  a  mouse  infection  model 29 . These  roles  for  NETs in  host  defense  are  important  and  complementary  to  those  of phagocytosis. However, the misconception that NETs  are a primary  means  by  which  neutrophils  kill  microorganisms  has become  seemingly  pervasive  outside  of  the  field  of  phagocyte biology.  Here  we  compare  and  contrast  phagocytosis  and  the formation of NETs (and outcomes associated with each process) as components of host defense.

## Physical sequestration of microbes following phagocytosis

There  is  no  question  that  the  ability  of  neutrophils  to  sequester microbes  within  an  enclosed  phagocytic  vacuole  (phagosome) is important for host defense. Ingested microbes can no longer disseminate freely, and molecules normally shed or secreted  from  pathogenic  microbes  are  contained  within  phagosomes  and  thus  unable  to  contribute  to  disease.  By  comparison, NETs  ensnare  microorganisms,  but  surface  binding  to  a  DNA scaffold  is  not  likely  to  prevent  dissemination  fully.  Moreover, NET-bound microbes are still able to release molecules such  as bacterial endotoxins  that can  be detrimental. These latter points notwithstanding, studies by Branzk et al . and

<!-- image -->

Thanabalasuriar et al . underscore the important role played by  NETs  if  phagocytosis  is  not  possible  (because  particles  are too  large).  Branzk et al . also  found  that  when  phagocytosis occurs, it inhibits the formation  of  NETs  via  a  mechanism involving sequestration of neutrophil elastase 28 . This intriguing  finding  provides  support  to  the  idea  that  phagocytosis  and NETs have specific roles in host defense.

## High intraphagosomal concentration of microbicides

Few microorganisms have the ability to survive following phagocytosis  by  neutrophils.  This  is  because  intraphagosomal concentrations of neutrophil ROS  and  antimicrobial  peptides are  extraordinarily  high,  as  intraphagosomal  volume  is  limited (estimated  at  1.2  µm   for  bacterial  phagosomes) 3 30,31 .  For  example,  Winterbourn et  al .  estimated  the  initial  rate  of  superoxide generation as 5.2 mM/second  and  the  intraphagosomal  concentration of MPO  as  ~1  mM 31 .  Based  on  these  estimates, hypochlorous acid (HOCl), commonly  known  as  the active ingredient  in  household  bleach,  is  produced  at  134  mM/minute. The  granule  protein  concentration  in  the  neutrophil  phagosome has  been  estimated  to  be  as  high  as  200  mg/mL 30 . Although MPO and elastase, components of neutrophil azurophilic granules,  are  hallmark  features  of  NETs,  the  amount  present on  an  extracellular  DNA  scaffold  is  likely  far  less  than  that present  in  phagosomes.  Moreover,  the  concentration  of  ROS produced within phagosomes  is simply not possible on or near  NETs,  as  intact  and  viable  neutrophils  are  needed  to  produce  ROS,  the  half-life  of  these  molecules  is  limited,  and  they diffuse readily. Therefore, compared with the microbicidal processes that occur within phagosomes (following phagocytosis), NETs have far less capacity to kill microorganisms.

## Nonphlogistic removal of apoptotic neutrophils

ROS  and  antimicrobial  enzymes  contained  within  neutrophil granules are not microbe specific and can also cause non-specific damage to host cells and tissues if they are released by exocytosis or following cell lysis 32-34 .  Extracellular release of these toxic agents  by  neutrophils  contributes  significantly  to  many  human inflammatory  diseases.  Therefore,  it  is  not  surprising  that  neutrophil lifespan and  antimicrobial  functions are highly regulated.  Human  neutrophils  are  terminally  differentiated  cells  that undergo  apoptosis  constitutively  at  the  end  of  their  lifespan 35 . As  neutrophils  undergo  apoptosis,  they  lose  functional  capacity,  as  indicated  by  defects  in  chemotaxis,  phagocytosis,  degranulation,  and  the  ability  to  produce  superoxide  in  response  to certain stimuli 36 . Importantly, apoptotic neutrophils remain intact and are ingested by mononuclear phagocytes in a non-inflammatory process known  as efferocytosis 35 . Removal of apoptotic neutrophils helps maintain immune system homeostasis and is key to resolution of the inflammatory response. This  highly  regulated  process  prevents  host  exposure  to  components of lysed neutrophils. Therefore, it could be argued that  the  formation  of  NETs  by  cytolysis  is  an  incidental  phenomenon  that  results  from  necrotic  lysis  rather  than  a  unique type of cell death. This notion is gaining support among neutrophil biologists and cell death experts 19,25 .

## Noncytolytic versus cytolytic processes for the formation of NETs

The  formation  of  NETs  was  described  initially  as  a  cytolytic process  that  culminates  in  the  loss  of  plasma  membrane  integrity and release of cellular contents, most notably nuclear DNA,  histones,  and  components  of  cytoplasmic  granules,  into the  extracellular  milieu 16,17 . Indeed,  the  majority  of  studies  of NETs  or  their  components  either  directly  demonstrate  or  infer lysis of neutrophils. By  comparison,  Yousefi  and  colleagues first reported that extracellular traps form from mitochondrial  DNA  released  from  viable  eosinophils 37 .  This  finding  has since  been  extended  to  include  neutrophils 21 and  basophils 38 . The  formation  of  NETs  from  viable  neutrophils  is  a  noncytolytic  process  and  is  therefore  compatible  with  the  regulated turnover  of  neutrophils  described  above.  More  notably,  such  a process has the potential to function in concert with phagocytosis, as described above for microbes that cannot be ingested.

## NETs and human disease

Inasmuch as neutrophils are abundant leukocytes and have tremendous  capacity  for  cytotoxicity,  it  is  not  unexpected  that many  diseases  are  associated  with  NETs.  Although  there  are caveats  with  associating  NETs  and  human  disease,  the  sheer number  of  recent  findings  in  this  area  underscores  the  importance of strictly regulated neutrophil activation and  turnover (safe  removal)  to  health  and  homeostasis.  For  example,  NETs have  been  associated  with  multiple  types  of  cancer  and  cancer metastasis 39,40 ,  including breast cancer 41 ,  hepatocellular carcinoma 42 , lung  cancer 43 ,  ovarian  cancer 44 ,  oral  squamous  cell  carcinoma 45 , pancreatic cancer 46 ,  and  thyroid  cancer 47 .  NETs have been implicated  in  autoimmune  disorders  such  as  lupus  erythematosus 48-51 and  in  the  development  of  thrombosis 52-54 and  can  contribute  to the  severity  of  sepsis 55,56 . Cell-free  or  extracellular  DNA  associated with elastase, MPO,  and/or  citrullinated histones has been  associated  with  numerous  respiratory  diseases.  NETs  or NET  components  have  been  found  in  sputum  from  individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary  disease 57 and severe asthma 58 , plasma  from  patients  with  severe  influenza  A  virus infection 59 , bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from patients with ventilator-associated  pneumonia 60 , and  in  plasma  from  patients with  acute  respiratory  distress  syndrome 61 .  Most  recently,  NETs have been associated with severe COVID-19 62,63 .

Collectively,  these  data  further  support  the  idea  that  nonphlogistic  turnover  of  neutrophils  is  essential  to  human  health.  In contrast to NETs,  neutrophil phagocytosis is not associated directly with severe pathologies or disease.

## Conclusion

The  idea  that  neutrophils  utilize NETs  extensively  to  eradicate  microbes or that NETs are employed for host defense more prominently  than phagocytosis has become  increasingly  pervasive outside of the field of phagocyte biology. Although a  significant  body  of  work  supports  the  notion  that  NETs  can contribute  to  host  defense,  the  relative  contribution  of  NETs to  human  host  defense in  vivo remains  largely  unknown.  This

issue  is  difficult  to  address,  in  part  because  the  formation  of NETs  and neutrophil lysis can be synonymous. Identification  of  cell-free/extracellular  DNA  associated  with  citrullinated histones  and/or  neutrophil  granule  proteins  is  consistent  with neutrophil  lysis in  vivo ,  a  phenomenon  linked  to  tissue  destruction  and  disease.  Indeed,  the  vast  majority  of  studies  published on  the  topic  of  NETs  within  the  past  two  years  underscore  the role  of  NETs  in  disease.  These  data  are  consistent  with  the long-held tenet that uncontrolled release of neutrophil components,  as  occurs  in  cytolysis,  is  detrimental  to  health  and exacerbates disease. Notably, the host immune system has evolved numerous tightly controlled mechanisms to prevent

Here  we  considered  phagocytosis  and  NETs  as  components  of host  defense.  Based  on  an  assessment  of  historic  and  recently published studies and established paradigms, it seems  clear that  phagocytosis  coupled  to  rapid  phagosome-granule  fusion and  ROS  production  remains  the  primary  means  by  which  neutrophils  eliminate  invading  microbes.  More  work  is  needed  to determine  the relative contribution of NETs  and  other  lytic cell death mechanisms to host defense in vivo .
