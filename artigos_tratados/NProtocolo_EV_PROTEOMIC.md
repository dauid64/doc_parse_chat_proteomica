## Materials and Methods

## 1. Cell culture

## Blood neutrophils

After neutrophil separation centrifugation on a density gradient using Ficoll-Paque, the remaining red blood cells were lysed with distilled water. Cell counting and viability was performed using the ADAM automatic Cell Counter (Montreal-Biotech Inc., Montréal, QC, CA). Cytospin slides were  prepared  (Cytospin,  ROTTORFIX  Hettish)  and  stained  with  Protocol  Hema  3  (Fisher Canada, Nepean, CA) for differential counting of ≥400 cells to assess neutrophil purity.

Neutrophils  (3  x  10   cells/condition)  were  suspended  at  5  ×  10   cells/mL  in  culture  medium 8 6 RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% heat inactivated low-endotoxin and exosome-free  FBS, 2 mM l-glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 µ g/mL streptomycin (all products from GIBCO, Life Technologies, Burlington, Canada), and cultured in 6- or 12-well plates (non-treated plastic, Ultident, Canada, St. Laurent, Canada) in the presence or absence of Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Escherichia coli 0:111B4 (100 ng/mL, Sigma-Aldrich, Oakville, Canada) for 18h in a CO2 incubator  at 37°  C.  These  concentrations  were  shown  to  induce  pro-inflammatory  gene expression by equine neutrophils (1). Supernatants were kept at -20° C until use.

## Airway Smooth Muscle cells

Airway  Smooth  Muscle  (ASM)  cells were  isolated  from  bronchial  tissue  obtained  from  horse lungs  from  the  slaughterhouse  by  enzymatic  digestion  (0.125U/mL  of  collagenase  H  (Roche; Laval, QC, CA), 1U/mL of elastase (Cederlane Labs; Burlington, Canada)), and with 1mg/mL of

trypsin  inhibitor  (Sigma  Aldrich).  The  digested  cells  were  then  seeded  (50  000  cells/cm³)  in DMEM/F12  (3:1)  medium  (Life  Technologies),  supplemented  with  sodium  pyruvate  100 µ M (Life  Technologies),  adenine  2.4mg/L  (Sigma  Aldrich),  10%  fetal  bovine  serum  (FBS)  (Life Technologies), penicillin-streptomycin (Life Technologies), and fungizone (Life Technologies). The medium was changed every 48h, and cells were passaged at a 1:3 ratio with trypsin every 710  days.  Cells  were  used  after  the  first  passage. The  purity  of  each  ASM  preparation  was evaluated  by  flow  cytometry  using  specific  contractile  proteins  (anti-α-SMA,  anti-desmin,  and anti-SMMHC). ASM cells (10  cells) were washed twice in PBS (Phosphate-buffered saline) 1X, 6 counted and fixed for 20 min in the Cytofix/Cytoperm solution (BD Biosciences, ON, CA). After three washes in the wash buffer (BD Bioscience), cells were stained for intracellular markers with anti-α-SMA, anti-desmin and anti-SMMHC antibodies. Briefly ASM cells were stained for 1 h with anti-α-SMA (Sigma Aldrich; dilution 1/250), anti-desmin (Abcam; dilution 1/200) and antiSMMHC (Biomed  technologies;  dilution  1/300)  (10 6 cells/100  μl).  All  incubation  steps  were performed at 4 °C. Cells were then washed 3 times in washing buffer and incubated 30 min in the dark with Alexa488- or Alexa594-conjugated anti-IgG antibodies (Invitrogen; dilution 1/1 000). Cells were washed twice and suspended in 400μl PBS 1X before flow cytometry acquisition of 10  000  events  and  analysis  using  CellQuest  Pro  software  on  a  FACSCalibur  instrument  (BD Bioscience).  Isotype-matched  control  antibodies  (mouse  IgG2a  and  rabbit  IgG)  were  used  as control. Staining was evaluated by the mean percentage of positive cells.

## 2. Flow cytometry and morphological evaluation of apoptosis

APC Annexin V staining was performed as described previously (2). APC Annexin V-positive and 7-AAD-negative cells were considered apoptotic cells.

## 3. Exosome isolation and purification

Proteomic  analysis  Supernatants  were  centrifuged  at 300  g  for 10  min,  followed  by centrifugation  at  10,000  g  for  30  min.  The  exosomes  were  then  concentrated  using  a  10  kDa cutoff Microcon centrifugal filter (MRCPRT010; Millipore), and applied on a Sepharose CL-2B (150 mL for all isolations, GE Healthcare) following the protocol in (3). The eluate was collected in 15 sequential fractions of 0.5 ml. For each fraction, the number of particles was determined by particle  sizing  analysis  (NICOMP  380),  protein  values  were  measured  using  a  Nano  Drop  or visualized on a 10% gradient gel (BioRad, Hercules, Canada) stained with Bio-Safe Coomassie G-250 (BioRad), and exosomal specific proteins were revealed by western-blot.

In  vitro  experiment  -  Briefly,  supernatants  were  centrifuged  at  300  g  for  10  min,  followed  by centrifugation at 10,000 g for 30 min. Supernatants were filtered through a 0.22 μm polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF)  membrane  and  the exosomes were isolated in a final ultracentrifugation at 100,000 g for 60 min. The exosome pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of PBS and  further  ultracentrifuged  at  100,000  g  for  60  min.  The  final  exosome  preparations  were resuspended in PBS, in RIPA (Radioimmunoprecipitation assay) buffer, or in fixing agents (150 μl), and exosome purity was confirmed on the basis of particle size, morphology (TEM), and the presence  of  characteristic  exosomal  proteins.  For  proliferation  assay,  exosomes  (in  PBS)  were divided into aliquots and stored at -80°C. For a visualization of full range extravesicles secreted by neutrophils (microvesicles and exosomes), cell supernatants were recovered after a 300g/10,000g, and subsequently a 100,000g centrifugation.

## 4. Electron microscopy

Exosomes  were  fixed  in  2%  glutaraldehyde  (w/v)  in  200  mM  phosphate  buffer  (pH  7.4)  and overlaid  on  a  Formvar  carbon-coated  grid  (FCF400-NI-50;  Electron  Microscopy  Sciences,

Hatfield, USA) and left to dry. After 3 washes in phosphate buffer, the exosomes were further fixed in 1% glutaraldehyde for 5 min, washed in distilled water, and stained with aqueous uranyl oxalate (pH  7)  for 5 min.  Samples  were  embedded  in  0.4%  uranyl  acetate  and  1.8% methylcellulose  on  ice  for  10  min.  Excess  liquid  was  then  absorbed  with  a  Whatman  filter (Sigma-Aldrich). The grids were dried at room temperature for 5 min before analyses. Exosomes were visualized with the CM100 electron microscope (Philips, Eindhoven, The Netherlands).

Alternatively, samples were fixed with low concentrations of glutaraldehyde (0.5%) in 200 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), overlaid on a Formvar carbon-coated grid (FCF400-NI-50; Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, USA) and stained with phosphotungstic acid (2%) (pH 7) for 5 min. The grids were washed and dried at room temperature for 20 min before analyses. Exosomes were visualized with the HT7700 (Hitachi, Toronto, Canada).

## 5. Particle Sizing System

As  exosomes  are  too  small  to  readily  be  visualized,  the  quality  of  exosome  preparations  was confirmed by measuring the hydrodynamic radius with a particle sizing system (NICOMP 380, PSS,  Port  Richey,  FL)  using  a  disposable  index-matching  low  volume  sample  cells  (SigmaAldrich).

## 6. Western-blot analysis

Proteins  from  all  fractions  (0.5ml)  were  precipitated  using  the  trichloroacetic  acid  (20%  final concentration; Sigma-Aldrich) and washed with cold acetone. From each fraction of exosomes extracted  (from  filtration/ultracentrifuge  method),  equal  amounts  of  protein  (20  µg)  were  were migrated in a 10% Mini-PROTEAN TGX Stain-Free precast polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Biorad)  and  transferred  on  a  PVDF  membrane  (Millipore,  Etobicoke,  CA).  Membranes  were

blocked with 5% powder milk and incubated with anti-TSG101 (1:300; #ARP38773; Cederlane), anti-CD9 (1:200; #312102, Biolegend), and anti-Grp78 (1:250; #LC-C638; Cederlane) antibodies.  After  several  washes,  the  membranes  were  further  incubated  with  appropriate horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit/mouse antibodies (1:4,000; 7074 and 7076; Cell Signaling, Danvers, USA).

Signals  were  detected  using  the  BM  chemiluminescence  blotting  substrate  (dura  kit,  Fisher Canada) and the membranes were scanned with the Fusion FX7 system (Montreal Biotech Inc.).

## 7. Exosome labeling

Briefly, the exosome preparations were mixed with 0.5 μM PKH67 and incubated at 37°C for 5 min. After ice-cold PBS was added, the mixture was centrifuged at 100,000 g. The vesicles were then washed twice in fresh PBS and centrifuged at 100,000 g. The labeled exosome suspension was filtered through an ultraconcentrator with a 100 kDa molecular mass cutoff (Millipore), and the resulting free dye was used as the negative control to create a background control for possible pelleted unbound dye.

## 8. Live cell and standard confocal microscopy

ASM cells were incubated with PKH67-labeled exosomes (10 μg/2×10  cells) in a cell culture 5 dish (Tissue culture treated glass slide #354104, BD Falcon, Mississauga, Canada) for 3 hours. The  cells  were  visualized  with  an  Olympus  Fluoview  FV1000  confocal  unit  attached  to  the inverted Olympus IX81 microscope suited for a LUCPLFLN x40 N.A 0.6 objective (Olympus Canada, Richmond Hill, ON, Canada).

## 9. Nano-LC-MS/MS

Protein  digestion -  Samples  (unstimulated  and  LPS-stimulated  neutrophils  derived  exosomes) were solubilized in 50 mM  ammonium  bicarbonate-1% sodium deoxycholate. Protein concentration of each sample was determined by colorimetric Bradford assay. Proteins (20 µg) were solubilized in 25 µl 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate- 1% sodium deoxycholate and heated at 95°C for 5min. Samples were reduced with DTT (1 μg) at 37°C for 30min and cysteins were alkylated by iodoacetamide (5 μg) at 37°C for 20min. Finally, Trypsin (1 µg) was added and the samples were incubated overnight at 37°C. The trypsin reaction was stopped by acidification with 3% acetonitrile-1%  TFA-0.5%  acetic  acid.  Peptides  were  purified  on  stage  tip  (C18),  vacuum dried, then resuspended into 2% acetonitrile, 0.05% TFA for analysis by mass spectrometry.

Mass  spectrometry -  Samples  were  analyzed  by  nanoLC/MSMS  as  triplicates  for  statistical information. For each injection, 750ng of peptide samples were injected and separated by online reversed-phase  (RP)  nanoscale  capillary  liquid  chromatography  (nanoLC)  and  analyzed  by electrospray mass spectrometry (ESI MS/MS). The experiments were performed with a Dionex UltiMate 3000 nanoRSLC chromatography system (Thermo Fisher Scientific / Dionex Softron GmbH,  Germering,  Germany)  connected  to  an  Orbitrap  Fusion  mass  spectrometer  (Thermo Fisher  Scientific,  San  Jose,  CA,  USA)  equipped  with  a  nanoelectrospray  ion  source  Peptides were trapped at 20 μl/min in loading solvent (2% acetonitrile, 0.05% TFA) on a 5mm x 300 μm C18 pepmap cartridge pre-column (Thermo Fisher Scientific / Dionex Softron GmbH, Germering, Germany) during 5 minutes. Then, the pre-column was switched online with a self-made 50 cm x 75µm  internal  diameter  separation  column  packed  with  ReproSil-Pur  C18-AQ  3µm  (Maisch HPLC  GmbH,  Ammerbuch-Entringen,  Germany)  and  the  peptides  were  eluted  with  a  linear gradient from 5-40% solvent B (A: 0.1% formic acid, B: 80% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid) in

90 minutes, at 300 nL/min. Mass spectra were acquired using a data dependent acquisition mode using Thermo XCalibur software version 3.0.63. Full scan mass spectra (350 to 1800m/z) were acquired in the orbitrap using an AGC target of 4e5, a maximum injection time of 50 ms, and a resolution  of  120,000.  Internal  calibration  using  lock  mass  on  the  m/z  445.12003  siloxane  ion was  used.  Each  MS  scan  was  followed  by  acquisition  of  fragmentation  MSMS  spectra  of  the most intense ions for a total cycle time of 3 seconds (top speed mode). The selected ions were isolated using the quadrupole analyzer in a window of 1.6 m/z and fragmented by Higher energy Collision-induced  Dissociation  (HCD)  with  35%  of  collision  energy.  The  resulting  fragments were detected by the linear ion trap in rapid scan rate with an AGC target of 1e4 and a maximum injection  time  of  50  ms.  Dynamic  exclusion  of  previously  fragmented  peptides  was  set  for  a period of 20 sec and a tolerance of 10 ppm.

## 10. Database searching and Label Free Quantification

Spectra were searched against a horse proteins database (UniprotKB - taxonomy Equus Caballus - 27986 sequences) using the Andromeda module of MaxQuant software v. 1.5.0.25*. Trypsin/P enzyme parameter was selected with two possible missed cleavages. Carbamidomethylation of cysteins  was  set  as  fixed  modifications,  methionine  oxidation  and  acetylation  of  protein  Nterminus as variable modifications. Mass search tolerances were set to 5ppm and 0.6Da for MS and  MS/MS  respectively.  For  protein  validation,  a  maximum  False  Discovery  Rate  of  1%  at peptide and protein level was used based on a target/decoy search. MaxQuant was also used for Label Free Quantification. The 'match between runs' option was used with a 20 min value as an alignment time window and 3 min as a match time window. Only unique and 'razor' peptides were  used  for  quantification.  The  LFQ  intensity  values  (normalized  values)  extracted  by MaxQuant for each protein in each sample replicate were used to calculate the ratio between the

two samples and to compute a p-value based on a t-test. When LFQ intensity values were missing, they were replaced either by the average of the values of the two other replicates, or if less than two  replicate  values  were  present,  were  replaced  by  a  noise  value  corresponding  to  the  first percentile of LFQ values of all proteins of the sample replicate. A protein was considered to be quantifiable only if at least two replicate values were present in one of the compared samples. A protein was considered to be variant if the fold change between the two compared samples was higher than 2 and the associated p-value was lower than 0.05. To dress a proteomic exosomal profile  of  neutrophils  exosomes  (S1  Table  1),  we  used  PANTHER  (Protein  Analysis  THrough Evolutionary  Relationships;  http://www.pantherdb.org)  software  allowing  a  classification  of proteins (and their genes).

## 11. Gene Ontology Enrichment Analysis

For  GoMiner,  a  local  mirror  of  Gene  Ontology  database  (release  2015.04.01)  was  used  with taxon 9796 (Equus Caballus). Statistical significance was based on GoMiner's FDR calculation (4).    For  Bingo,  Gene  Ontology  OBO  file  (http://geneontology.org/ontology/go.obo,  version 2015-05-14) and uniprot GO annotation file for the Equus Caballus proteome ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/GO/goa/proteomes /29002.E\_caballus.goa release 2015-04-25) were used.

## 12. Proliferation assay

The  background  impedance  was  done  using  35 µ l  of  fresh  DMEM/F12  media.  In  each  well, 14,000  ASM  cells  were  seeded  in  100 μL  of  complete  media  and  left  to  equilibrate  at  room temperature for 30 min before data recording. ASM cells were grown at 37°C in a humidified

atmosphere with 5% CO2 over-night, and monitored for impedance to insure the normal growth kinetic  of  these  cells.  Exosome  preparations  (or  appropriate  control  i.e.  PBS  or  residual  LPS consisting in medium with LPS at 100 ng/mL ultracentrifuged, pelleted and resuspended in the same volume as exosome) were added to the cell cultures after 22 hours (plateau-phase cells). The impedance value of each well was automatically monitored every 15 min for a duration of 50h  and  expressed  as  a  CI  (Cell  Index)  value.  Data  were  analyzed  using  the  XCELLigence software  (version  1.2.1)  and  expressed  as  mean  ±  SD  of  cell  index  normalized  to  the  last  cell index recorded before the time of cell treatment (addition of exosomes). The rate of cell growth was determined by calculating the slope of the line between two given time points (22h-48h) and data  are  presented  as  the  ratio  of  slopes  Exo/CTL  (PBS  or  residual  LPS).  Alternatively,  ASM cells were incubated with LPS at 100 ng/mL and proliferation was measured.

## 13. Statistical Analysis

Proliferation -  Statistical  analyses  were  performed  using  GraphPad  Prism  6.0g  software.  All results  were  expressed  in  mean  +/-  standard  deviation  (SD).  Student  t-test  was  used  for  mean comparison and a p value of 0.05 was considered significant.

GO ontologyStatistical significance was based on a hypergeometric test with Bonferroni family wise correction for multiple testing. The enrichments were calculated based on two comparisons: 1)  the  variant  proteins  against  a  background  of  the  observed  proteins  and,  2)  the  observed proteins against the complete proteome.

A ( ) Equine bronchial smooth muscle cells were analysed by flow  cytometry.  Scatter  plot  was  obtained  ( A )  and  we  apply  a  nonrectangular gate based on FSC and SSC excluding cell debris or cell ghosts. The percentage of positive cell for α -SMA, desmin and SMMHC staining are determined. Data are representative of three independent experiments. ( B E -) Cells were immunolabeled in monolayer on Lab-tek chamber  slides  with  an  antiα -SMA  (green),  an  anti-SMMHC  (red)  ( B and C )  or  anti-desmin  (red)  ( D and E )  or  and  DAPI (nucleus: blue) or with  isotype  control  antibodies  ( F ).  Cells  are  visualized  by  fluorescent microscopy (scale bars, 10 µm and 100 µm for isotype).

E4: Equine peripheral blood neutrophils apoptosis .  Freshly  isolated  equine neutrophils  (n  =  3)  were  incubated  for  18  h  in  the  absence  or  presence  of Lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) at  100  ng/ml.  The  number  of  viable  cells  was assessed by flow cytometry using APC Annexin V/7-AAD staining. APC Annexin V posiMve cells and 7-AAD negaMve cells were considered as apoptoMc cells. Bars represent means  +  SEM.  No  significant effect of treatment  over unsMmulated cells (p=0.83).
