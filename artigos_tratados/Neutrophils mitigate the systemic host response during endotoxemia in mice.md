## Summary

Recent studies have suggested that neutrophils can exert anti-inflammatory effects. To determine the role of neutrophils in the acute response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), component of the gram-negative bacterial cell wall, we challenged neutrophil depleted and control mice with LPS and analyzed the plasma concentrations of biomarkers indicative of the cytokine and chemokine network, activation of coagulation and the vascular endothelium, and cellular injury. We here show that neutrophils serve an anti-inflammatory role upon LPS administration, as reflected by sustained elevations in multiple cytokines and chemokines, and enhanced release of nucleosomes in mice depleted of neutrophils, compared to control mice.

## Introduction

Neutrophils are traditionally considered important players in acute inflammation with a key function in the elimination of extracellular pathogens [1]. Recent investigations have indicated that the role of neutrophils in immunity stretches beyond a limited set of pro-inflammatory actions in the innate immune response [2]. Neutrophils have been implicated in chronic inflammatory conditions and the regulation of adaptive immune responses, and a subset of neutrophils may even exert anti-inflammatory effects [1,2]. In addition, neutrophils may cause a misbalance in hemostasis through activation of coagulation and concurrent inactivation of natural anticoagulants [3].

Intravenous administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a component of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria, has been used as a model of acute systemic inflammation in humans and rodents, and is accompanied by a strong increase in neutrophil counts in peripheral blood [4]. Intravenous LPS injection in humans was associated with the appearance of a neutrophil subset in the circulation that was capable of suppressing T cell proliferation and less able to adhere to endothelial cells [5,6]. Significant numbers of these 'anti-inflammatory' neutrophils were detected several hours after LPS administration and these anti-inflammatory neutrophils were also found in patients with a severe injury. Depletion of neutrophils in mice prior to LPS injection resulted in higher plasma levels of interleukin (IL)-1 β when compared to animals not depleted of neutrophils [7]. The aim of the present study was to determine the role of these anti-inflammatory neutrophils in the systemic inflammatory, vascular and procoagulant response to LPS.

## Material and Methods

Female C57Bl/6 mice were purchased from Charles River Inc. (Maastricht, The Netherlands). Mice were housed under specific pathogen-free conditions receiving food and water ad libitum . Experiments were carried out in accordance with the Dutch Experiment on Animals Acts and approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Amsterdam (permit number DIX102291). Mice were studied at 12 weeks of age. Endotoxemia was induced by intraperitoneal injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS; from Escherichia coli 055:B5; Sigma-Aldrich; 10 mg/kg in 200 µL 0.9% NaCl). Mice were depleted of neutrophils by intraperitoneal injection with anti-mouse-GR1 (clone RB6.8C5; rat IgG IgG2b, kappa; 100 µg) 24 hours prior to LPS administration [8]. Control mice were given the equivalent amount of isotype control antibody anti-phytochrome (clone AFRC Mac 5.1; rat IgG IgG2b, kappa). EDTA anticoagulated plasma was obtained before, 4 and 24 hours after LPS injection (n = 8 mice per group at each time point). White blood cell counts were determined in a hemocytometer (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA), and differential cell counts

were performed on cytospin preparations stained with Giemsa stain (Diff-Quick; Dade Behring, Düdingen, Switzerland).

Tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin (IL)-10 and interferon (IFN)γ were determined using a commercially available cytometric beads array multiplex assay (BD Biosciences, Breda, the Netherlands). IL-6, CXCL1, CXCL2, soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM) 1, soluble E-selectin (all R&amp;D Systems, Abingdon, UK), thrombin-antithrombin complexes (TATc, Affinity Biologicals INC, Ancaster, Canada) and nucleosomes [9] were determined by ELISA. Plasma creatinine and aspartate aminotransferase (ASAT) were measured using a c702 Roche Diagnostics (Roche Diagnostics BV, Almere, the Netherlands). Groups were compared by Kruskal Wallis test followed by Mann-Whitney U test were appropriate. P &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

## Results and Discussion

LPS injection induced a brisk rise in neutrophil counts in peripheral blood in mice treated with the control antibody (Figure 1). Mice treated with anti-GR1 antibody showed a persistent neutropenia. Cytokine and chemokine responses were more sustained in neutrophil depleted mice; all cytokines (TNF, IL-6, IL-10, IFNγ ) and chemokines (CXCL1, CXCL2) measured were significantly higher in mice with neutropenia 24 hours after injection of LPS (Figure 1).

To obtain insight into the role of neutrophils in the procoagulant and endothelial cell response to LPS we measured the plasma levels of TATc, soluble VCAM-1 and soluble E-selectin (Figure 2). The plasma concentration of TATc is a measure of the generation of thrombin and its subsequent binding of its natural inhibitor antithrombin, thereby reflecting activation of the coagulation system. Baseline TATc concentrations were lower in neutrophil depleted mice when compared to control mice; however, the LPS induced increase in plasma TATc levels did not differ between groups. Likewise, neutrophil depletion did not modify the LPS-induced increase in plasma soluble VCAM-1 levels, although at 24 hours post-LPS soluble VCAM-1

concentrations tended to be lower in neutrophil depleted mice. Remarkably, neutrophil depletion strongly reduced plasma soluble E-selectin concentrations; this effect was already detectable before LPS injection and the LPS-induced rise in soluble E-selectin levels as virtually absent in neutrophil depleted mice.

Nucleosomes, which are segments of DNA wound around histone protein cores, can be released from dead cells by the activity of endonucleases and factor VII-activating protease [10]. Nucleosomes detected in the circulation have been used as a marker of inflammation

[11]. Nucleosomes were not detectable in plasma before LPS injection (Figure 2). LPS induced an increase in plasma nucleosome concentrations in control mice, but notably the increase in neutrophil depleted mice was much higher.  Plasma markers of organ injury did not show differences between neutrophil depleted and control mice: kreatinin (renal function) and ALAT (liver injury) did not increase upon LPS administration in either group (data not shown), whereas ASAT (indicative of hepatocellular injury) similarly increased in both groups after the induction of endotoxemia (Figure 2), showing the specificity of the strong increase in plasma nucleosome concentration in anti-GR1 treated mice. Of note, the LPS-induced vascular and injurious responses had not yet declined at 24 hours; our study does not provide insight into possible effects of neutrophil depletion beyond 24 hours after LPS administration.

Neutrophils are at the front line of the innate immune system and essential elements in host defense especially against extracellular pathogens [1,2]. Excessive activity of neutrophils may cause tissue injury in non-infectious conditions and severe infection, exemplifying the strong proinflammatory nature of these cells. More recent evidence has indicated, however, that neutrophils can also exert immune modulating and anti-inflammatory effects [1,2]. We here studied the role of neutrophils in the systemic host reaction elicited by LPS by comparing cytokine, procoagulant, vascular and damage responses in mice with or without depletion of neutrophils. Our main finding was that neutrophil depletion was associated with

exaggerated responses to LPS, suggesting anti-inflammatory activity of neutrophils under these conditions.

Neutrophil depletion resulted in an enhanced cytokine and chemokine response to intravenous LPS, which involved both proinflammatory mediators and the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. In accordance, LPS-induced TNF and IL-1 β production by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells was lowered in the presence of neutrophils [7]. This inhibitory effect of neutrophils was partially reversed by addition of α 1-antitrypsin, suggesting the involvement of a protease [7]. Indeed, elastase was shown to degrade TNF and IL-1 β ; however, these data are unlikely to explain our present results, considering that elastase cannot degrade IL10 [7], while IL-10 levels were consistently higher in neutrophil depleted mice.

Neutrophils can also influence activation of the coagulation system by producing neutrophil extracellular traps, which can promote tissue-factor mediated coagulation, and through degranulation with release of elastase, which can inactivate natural anticoagulants such as tissue factor pathway inhibitor and thrombomodulin [3]. These procoagulant effects mediated by neutrophils might explain at least in part the lower plasma TATc levels in neutrophil depleted mice prior to LPS injection. The current finding that neutrophil depletion did not modify the LPS-induced rise in plasma TATc levels suggests that neutrophils do not contribute to the initiation of coagulation during endotoxemia. Although these data do not exclude a role for neutrophils in microvascular thrombosis during infection and sepsis, in our model they do not play a major role. Moreover, our results do not exclude a role for NETs in LPS-induced systemic inflammation.

During inflammation neutrophils adhere to the vascular endothelium, which is associated with proinflammatory changes in both neutrophils and endothelial cells [1]. Neutrophil depletion strongly reduced soluble E-selectin levels, while not affecting the concentrations of soluble VCAM-1. Both proteins are shed by endothelial cells and their plasma concentrations have been used as markers of endothelial cell activation [12]. While the release of soluble VCAM-

1 from endothelial cells can be induced by several ADAM metallopeptidases (ADAM8, ADAM9 and ADAM17), the protease(s) responsible for the shedding of E-selectin remain to be discovered [13,14]. Besides ADAMs, members of two additional protease families are important for proteolytic cleavage of cell surface transmembrane proteins with release of a soluble extracellular domain fragment: metalloproteinases and soluble neutrophil-derived serine proteinases [13]. It is tempting to speculate that the release of soluble E-selectin was reduced in neutrophil depleted mice due to lack of a neutrophil-derived protease.

Nucleosomes are released from dying and injured cells into the extracellular environment. The plasma concentrations of nucleosomes are elevated in a variety of diseases, including cancers, stroke, trauma and sepsis [15] We here show that LPS injection induces a rise in the plasma levels of nucleosomes. This increase was much stronger in neutrophil depleted mice, suggesting that neutrophils limit cell death during endotoxemia and that neutrophils are not a predominant source of nucleosomes during LPS-induced injury. Unaltered plasma levels of creatinine, and the similarly modestly elevated plasma levels of ASAT in both neutrophil depleted and control mice suggest that the differential release of nucleosomes in both groups does not originate from kidneys or hepatocytes.

Neutrophils present a large phenotypic heterogeneity and functional diversity, which partially relate to their location (blood or tissues). Our study does not provide conclusive information on which neutrophil subset drives the anti-inflammatory effects exposed here by neutrophil depletion. In addition, our study was limited to markers of systemic inflammatory, vascular and procoagulant responses and did not investigate the effect of neutrophil depletion on mortality.

The data presented here suggest that neutrophilic leukocytosis induced by intravenous LPS at least in part serves an anti-inflammatory role, as reflected by sustained elevations in the plasma concentrations of multiple cytokines and chemokines, and enhanced release of
