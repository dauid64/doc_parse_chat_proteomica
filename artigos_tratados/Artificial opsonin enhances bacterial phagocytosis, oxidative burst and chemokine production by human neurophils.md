## ABSTRACT

Here, we describe the application of an 'artificial opsonin' to stimulate the innate immune response against Gram-positive bacteria. The artificial opsonin comprises a poly(L-lysine)graft -poly(ethylene glycol) backbone displaying multiple copies of vancomycin and human IgG-Fc. The vancomycin targets bacteria by recognizing d-Ala-d-Ala-terminated peptides present in the bacterial cell wall. The human IgG-Fc antibody fragments serve as phagocyte recognition moieties that recognize the Fc γ cell surface receptors expressed by professional human phagocytes. Staphylococcus epidermidis RP62A, a biofilm-forming, methicillin-resistant strain, was utilized to investigate the effects of opsonization on phagocytosis, oxidative burst and IL-8 chemokine production by human neutrophils. Results show that opsonization of S. epidermidis RP62A with the artificial opsonin resulted in an ∼ 2-fold increase in neutrophil phagocytosis. Analysis of the cell supernatant found a 2- to 3-fold increase in neutrophil IL-8 secretion. The neutrophil oxidative burst was investigated using the oxidation-sensitive fluorophore dihydrorhodamine-123. Bacterial opsonization resulted in a 20% increase in fluorescence intensity, indicating a significant increase in the production of reactive oxygen species by the neutrophils. These studies suggest that artificial opsonins may be a novel immunostimulation therapeutic strategy to control infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria, particularly those that are known to be immune evasive and/or antibiotic resistant.

## INTRODUCTION

Staphylococcus epidermidis , a commensal bacterium of the human skin, is the leading cause of hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) (Huebner and Goldmann 1999; von Eiff, Peters and Heilmann 2002; Vuong and Otto 2002). One in 10 patients incurs an HAI during their hospital stay, resulting in an estimated 1.7 million infections and 99 000 deaths per year in the USA alone (Klevens et al. 2007; Pollack 2010). It has been estimated that ∼ 50% of HAIs are associated with indwelling medical de-

ces (Darouiche 2004) and that 80% of device-associated infections are caused by S. epidermidis (Gotz 2002). The current clinical approach to the prevention and treatment of medical device-related infections is the local or systemic administration of antibiotics. However, this strategy promotes the development of antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains (Wright and Sutherland 2007) and can also kill beneficial microflora. In fact, ∼ 75%-90% of S. epidermidis clinical isolates are now resistant to methicillin (Otto 2009), and the species is rapidly gaining resistance to many

Figure 1. Schematic of the artificial opsonin. The opsonin consists of multiple copies of vancomycin and human IgG-Fc attached to a soluble polymer support, poly(llysine)graft -poly(ethylene glycol) (i.e. PLLg -PEG). Vancomycin serves as a bacterial recognition molecule by binding to d-Ala-d-Ala-terminated peptides present in the cell wall of Gram-positive bacteria. Human IgG-Fc antibody fragment serves as a phagocyte recognition molecule and is recognized by the Fc γ cell surface receptors expressed by professional human phagocytes.

other antibiotics (Raad, Alrahwan and Rolston 1998; Hellmark et al. 2009), including vancomycin (Garrett et al. 1999). Unfortunately, S. epidermidis has also developed mechanisms to evade the host immune system (Foster 2005; Cheung et al. 2010), including the production of exopolysaccharides such as polyγ -glutamic acid (PGA) and polyN -acetylglucosamine (PNAG) that conceal the bacteria from recognition by opsonins (Peterson et al. 1978) and phagocytosis by neutrophils (Kocianova et al. 2005). Due to the species' immune evasion and antibiotic resistance mechanisms, infections caused by S. epidermidis are most often chronic (Voyich and DeLeo 2002), rendering immunocompromised patients especially vulnerable. These facts highlight the strong need for alternative antimicrobial therapies.

We previously reported on the development of an artificial opsonin that promotes the recognition and phagocytosis of numerous Gram-positive bacteria, including S. epidermidis , by human phagocytes (Katzenmeyer and Bryers 2011). As shown in Fig. 1, the opsonin comprises multivalent conjugates of the synthetic polymer poly(l-lysine)graft -poly(ethylene glycol) with naturally occurring bacterial and phagocyte recognition molecules. In our targeting scheme, bacterial recognition is provided by the glycopeptide antibiotic vancomycin. Vancomycin is able to bind to d-Ala-d-Ala-terminated muropeptides present in the Gram-positive bacterial cell wall as well as peptidoglycan precursors (Sieradzki, Pinho and Tomasz 1999; Courvalin 2006; Cui et al. 2006). These two targets of vancomycin represent non-vital and vital targets, respectively, since only the latter leads to cell death (due to inhibition of cell wall biosynthesis). In staphylococci, the number of non-vital targets exceeds the number of vital targets by two to three orders of magnitude (Hiramatsu 1998) and has been shown to be even higher in certain vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus (Cui et al. 2006). With these considerations in mind, we fabricated an artificial opsonin with an MW larger than the exclusion limit of the bacterial cell wall ( ∼ 120 kDa) (Scherrer and Gerhardt 1971; Demchick and Koch 1996) in order to restrict access of the conjugated vancomycin to only the non-vital muropeptide targets present in the exterior portion of the cell wall. In this design, the conjugated vancomycin is not allowed access to the peptidoglycan precursors (vital targets), thus negating vancomycin's toxicity. In bacteria containing vancomycin resistance genes, our design also prevents access to the vancomycin sensor, which is located

in the plasma membrane and is activated by direct interaction with vancomycin (Arthur 2010; Koteva et al. 2010). We previously confirmed that our approach not only prevents direct killing of a targeted bacterium, but also avoids induction of vancomycin resistance (Katzenmeyer and Bryers 2011).

As the phagocyte recognition molecule, we have utilized a human IgG-Fc antibody fragment, which is recognized by Fc γ cell surface receptors expressed by professional human phagocytes such as neutrophils and macrophages. Binding of phagocyte Fc γ Rs with multiple Fc regions on an opsonin-coated bacterium leads to clustering of the Fc γ Rs and subsequent cell activation (Huynh and Grinstein 2006; Ivan and Colovai 2006), phagocytosis of the bacterium (Hazenbos and Brown 2006), and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) through a process termed oxidative burst (Casado et al. 1994; Jefferis and Lund 2002; Fang 2004). All of these powerful antimicrobial mechanisms are employed by the phagocyte to ultimately destroy the bacterium and control infection. Previously, we confirmed that our artificial opsonin specifically recognizes a broad range of Gram-positive species, including clinical staphylococci isolates and vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus , and significantly enhances the phagocytosis of S. epidermidis RP62A by a human neutrophil cell line. Here, we expand our work to study the phagocytosis of opsonized bacteria by primary human neutrophils and investigate the efficacy of the artificial opsonin in the promotion of an oxidative burst and chemokine production by the neutrophils.

## MATERIALS AND METHODS

## Artificial opsonin fabrication and characterization

The conjugate PLL- -PEG-Van-Fc, denoted 'artificial opsonin', g was synthesized as previously reported (Katzenmeyer and Bryers 2011). Briefly, maleimide-functionalized PLLg -PEG was prepared by reaction of PLL (Mn = 47,900; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) with a bifunctional NHS-PEG-maleimide crosslinker (Pierce Biotechnology, Ashtabula OH). A thiolated vancomycin derivative was then reacted with the maleimide-functionalized PLLg -PEG to form PLLg -PEG-Van (MW ≈ 155 000). The remaining unreacted maleimide groups were blocked by the addition of l-cysteine to the reaction mixture. Human IgG-Fc (Bethyl Labs,

Montgomery, TX) and the PLLg -PEG-Van conjugate were subsequently functionalized with aromatic aldehyde and hydrazine crosslinkers (Solulink, San Diego CA), respectively, and reacted to form PLLg -PEG-Van-Fc (MW ≈ 230,000). The conjugates were purified by size exclusion chromatography and their chemical identity confirmed by NMR and FTIR. The degree of conjugation was quantified by UV-Vis spectroscopy and was determined to be 25 vancomycin molecules and 1.5 human IgG-Fc proteins per PLLg -PEG base polymer.

## Bacterial strains and culture

Staphylococcus epidermidis RP62A was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC R © Number 35 984, Manassas VA). For experiments, bacteria were grown overnight in Trypticase Soy Broth (Becton Dickinson, Ashtabula OH) at 37 C and · 180 rpm and subsequently transferred into fresh medium and grown for an additional ∼ 4 h until mid- to late-exponential phase. Cell concentration was determined by measuring the optical density at 600 nm with a spectrophotometer (UV-1601; Shimadzu, Durham NC) and comparing to a known growth curve correlation. Staphylococcus aureus (Wood strain without Protein A) BioParticles R © were purchased from Invitrogen. Prior to use, the BioParticles were dissolved in Hank's Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) plus 5% FCS to a concentration of 10 10 cells/mL followed by vigorous vortexing and sonication to break apart clumps.

## Neutrophil isolation

Human neutrophils were either purchased from Astarte Biologics (Kirkland, WA) or were isolated from the blood of healthy volunteers according to the methods of Voyich and DeLeo (2002). Briefly, whole blood was collected by venipuncture into ACD Vacutainer R © tubes (143 USP units of sodium heparin, BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) by a trained phlebotomist at the University of Washington Medical Center under a protocol approved by the UW Human Subjects Committee. Blood was gently mixed with an equal volume of 0.3% dextran/0.9% NaCl and allowed to rest at room temperature for 25 min to allow sedimentation. The top leukocyte-rich layer from the dextran-blood mixture was transferred to a fresh tube and centrifuged at 650 × g for 10 min to pellet the cells. The supernatant was then carefully aspirated and the pellet was resuspended in 35 mL of 0.9% NaCl. The cell suspension was carefully layered over 10 mL of Histopaque R © -1077 (Sigma-Aldrich) and centrifuged at 350 × g for 25 min (no brake). The supernatant was aspirated to leave the pellet containing polymorphonuclear cells and erythrocytes. The erythrocytes were then lysed by pipetting 20 mL of endotoxin-free water for 20 s, followed by immediate addition of an equal volume of 1.7% NaCl. The cells were then centrifuged at 350 × g for 8 min and resuspended in HBSS plus 5% FCS containing calcium and magnesium to a final concentration of 10 6 cells/mL.

## Neutrophil viability assay

Neutrophils were resuspended at 10 6 cells/mL in HBSS plus 5% FCS also containing 10% v/v alamarBlue R © (Invitrogen) in polypropylene microtubes. PLLg -PEG-Van-Fc was added at a final concentration of 2.8 µ M or 28 nM (based on PLL). Matched concentrations of PLL (2.8 µ M and 28 nM) and vancomycin (70 µ M and 700 nM) were also tested for comparison. The solutions were incubated for 1 h at 37 C with gentle end-over-end · rotation. Afterwards, solutions were transferred to a black 96-

issue culture polystyrene plate and the fluorescence intensity was measured with a microplate reader (Tecan Instruments, Morrisville, NC) using excitation/emission wavelengths of 560/590 nm and a bandwidth of 10 nm. Data were normalized to the untreated control.

## Phagocytosis assay

Live S. epidermidis RP62A cells were labeled with DyLight R © 488 NHS ester (Pierce Biotechnology, Waltham MA), and bacteria were rinsed extensively to remove unreacted dye. Bacteria were diluted to 10 9 cells/mL in HBSS + 5%FCS alone or HBSS + 5%FCS also containing 2 mg/mL human IgG-Fc (Bethyl Labs) or 2.8 µ M (based on PLL) PLLg -PEG-Van or PLLg -PEG-Van-Fc, and then incubated for 1 h at 37 C with end-over-end rotation to allow op-· sonization. Afterwards, bacteria were diluted to 10 8 cells/mL and 50 µ L of suspension was added to microtubes containing 0.5 mL of neutrophil suspension to yield a multiplicity of infection (MOI), or bacteria:neutrophil ratio, of 10. Tubes were incubated with gentle end-over-end rotation ( ∼ 5 rpm) at 37 C for 10 min · to allow phagocytosis. Afterwards, cells were immediately fixed by the addition of 0.5 mL of ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (Cytofix buffer; BD) to each tube and incubation on ice for 15-30 min. Cells were rinsed and resuspended in ice-cold HBSS without calcium and magnesium. The cell-associated fluorescence was measured using a FACSCanto (Becton Dickinson) flow cytometer equipped with FACSDiva acquisition software (Becton Dickinson). Cells were identified by forward and side angle light scatter, and the fluorescence intensity of 10 000 events was acquired. Data were analyzed with FlowJo software (Tree Star, Inc., Ashland, OR) after gating cells that displayed fluorescence greater than 99% of the untreated (i.e . no bacteria) control cells.

## Oxidative burst assay

The oxidative burst of the neutrophils was measured using methods similar to those described above for the phagocytosis experiments. Dihydrorhodamine-123 (DHR-123; Invitrogen) was added to the neutrophil suspension (10 6 cells/mL in HBSS + 5%FCS) at a final concentration of 100 µ M and incubated at 37 C for 10 min prior to addition of stimulant. After-· wards, 50 µ L of stimulant in HBSS + 5%FCS was added to the microtubes at the following final concentrations: 1 µ M N-formylmethionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine peptide (fMLP; Sigma-Aldrich), live S. epidermidis RP62A at MOI = 10, or killed S. aureus Wood BioParticles R © at MOI = 10. The bacterial stimulants were unlabeled and were either non-opsonized or opsonized with PLLg -PEG-Van-Fc as described above. PLLg -PEG-Van-Fc alone was also tested as a stimulant at a concentration matched to that present in the opsonized bacterial samples (28 nM based on PLL). The samples were incubated with gentle end-over-end rotation for 10 min at 37 C to allow phagocytosis and generation · of the oxidative burst. Samples were immediately transferred to a black 96-well tissue culture polystyrene plate and the fluorescence intensity was acquired with a microplate reader using excitation/emission wavelengths of 485/535 nm. Data were normalized to the readings obtained from the untreated control samples.

## Phagocytic efficiency

Because neutrophils may also kill by oxygen-independent mechanisms, overall phagocytic efficiency was determined in two additional assays. First, the ratio of bacteria ingested by

4

neutrophils to the total number of bacteria attached to neutrophils (extracellular bacteria) was quantified using fluorescent labeling techniques. Staphylococcus epidermidis RP62A was grown in suspended batch culture to the late exponential phase, harvested and resuspended in 1mL of 0.1M sodium bicarbonate buffer (pH 9.0). Live S. epidermidis RP62A cells were labeled with DyLight R © 488 NHS ester (Pierce Biotechnology), and bacteria were rinsed extensively to remove unreacted dye, then resuspended to a final concentration of 1 × 10 8 cells/mL in HBSS + 5% FCS containing (a) nothing (no treatment), (b) PLLg -PEGVan, (c) PLLg -PEG-Van-Fc, (d) IgG-Fc and (e) PLLg -PEG-Van-Fc + 10 µ g/mL cytochalasin D (phagocytosis inhibitor). Calibration curves of the bacterial cell numbers versus the fluorescent emission were prepared by serial dilution of DyLight-labeled bacterial cell suspensions followed by microscopic epifluorescent counting. The emission intensity was recorded using a Fluorimager and quantified using ImageQuant software. Fluorescently labeled bacteria were added to microtubes containing a neutrophil suspension (HBSS + 5% FCS) at an MOI = 10, and then incubated for 1 h at 37 C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Neutrophils and · any adherent bacteria were separated from freely suspended bacterial by membrane filtration (4.0 µ mpore size). Neutrophils were then resuspended in cold HBSS. Each sample was run in duplicate: one sample to determine the total number of bacterial cells (extracellular and ingested) per neutrophil and a second sample to determine only the number of bacteria inside the neutrophils. The fluorescence associated with bacteria on the exterior of the neutrophils was quenched by the addition of 4% trypan blue stain (ThermoFisher, Seattle WA) for 15 min, followed by rinsing with HBSS. Sample emissions were compared to standard curves of bacteria versus fluorescence to determine the total number of bacterial cells (external and internal to the neutrophil, unquenched samples) with only those bacteria inside a neutrophil (quenched samples).

Second, the efficiency of neutrophil killing of ingested bacteria was also determined. Live S. epidermidis RP62A cells (not labeled) at 1 × 10 5 cells/mL in HBSS + 5% FCS containing (a) nothing (no treatment), (b) PLLg -PEG-Van, (c) PLLg -PEG-Van-Fc, (d) IgG-Fc and (e) PLLg -PEG-Van-Fc + 10 µ g/mL cytochalasin D (phagocytosis inhibitor) were added to microtubes containing neutrophils a final MOI = 10 and incubated for 1 h at 37 C in · 5% CO2. Neutrophils and any adherent bacteria were separated from freely suspended bacteria by membrane filtration (4.0 µ m pore size). Neutrophils were then resuspended in cold HBSS and extracellular bacteria were lyzed by sonication and neutrophils rinsed again in cold HBSS. Neutrophils were then lyzed in sterile water, and contents were plated at appropriate dilutions of samples onto TSA plates to determine the viable bacterial numbers. Viable cell counts between 30 and 300 colony forming units per plate were determined. The number of bacterial killed per neutrophil was calculated as the number of total bacteria ingested per neutrophil (fluorescence assay)-the number of viable bacteria recovered per neutrophil.

## IL-8 ELISA

Isolated neutrophils (10 6 cells/mL in 1.5 mL HBSS + 5%FCS) were mixed with 150 µ L of stimulant at the following final concentrations: 100 ng/mL human TNFα (Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ) or live S. epidermidis RP62A at MOI = 10 or 30. As described above, bacteria were either non-opsonized or opsonized with PLLg -PEGVan-Fc. PLLg -PEG-Van-Fc alone was also tested at a concentration matched to that present in the opsonized bacterial samples (28 nM based on PLL for MOI = 10). The samples were incubated

with gentle end-over-end rotation for 4 h at 37 C. Afterwards, · IgG-free bovine serum albumin (BSA; Sigma-Aldrich) was supplemented to the tubes to yield a final concentration of 0.1% w/v BSA. The tubes were centrifuged at 10 000 × g for 10 min to pellet all cells, and the supernatant was carefully collected and transferred to clean tubes. The supernatants were aliquoted and stored frozen at -20 C until needed. Human IL-8 present in the · supernatants was detected using an ELISA kit (Peprotech) following the manufacturer's instructions.

## RESULTS

## Artificial opsonin fabrication and characterization

As shown in Fig. 1, the artificial opsonin (denoted PLLg -PEGVan-Fc) consists of a PLLg -PEG backbone with attached vancomycin moieties and human IgG-Fc proteins. Vancomycin is attached at the end of multiple PEG side chains, while human IgGFc is conjugated directly to the PLL base polymer. Using UV/Vis spectroscopy, it was determined that 16% of the PEG side chains contain pendant vancomycin groups while 2% of the remaining non-grafted PLL ε -amino groups were conjugated to human IgGFc. This yields an average of 25 vancomycin molecules and 1.5 IgG-Fc proteins per PLLg -PEG base polymer. A control polymer (denoted PLLg -PEG-Van) that lacks the conjugated IgG-Fc protein was also synthesized. The molecular weights of PLLg -VanFc and PLLg -PEG-Van were estimated to be 230 and 155 kDa, respectively. The detailed fabrication and characterization of the artificial opsonin and the control polymer has been described previously (Katzenmeyer and Bryers 2011).

## Artificial opsonin does not affect neutrophil viability

Wepreviously determined that the artificial opsonin PLLg -PEGVan-Fc does not affect the viability of targeted bacteria (i.e. S. epidermidis ) or the human HL-60 neutrophil cell line (Katzenmeyer and Bryers 2011). Here, we investigated the viability of primary human neutrophils in the presence of varying concentrations of PLLg -PEG-Van-Fc. Neutrophil viability was measured by an alamarBlue assay in which metabolically active cells reduce resazurin, a cell-permeable non-fluorescent dye, to resorufin, a bright red-fluorescent molecule that can be detected by fluorometry. As shown in Fig. 2, neutrophil viability was not affected by PLLg -PEG-Van-Fc at any concentration tested (28 nM and 2.8 µ Mbased on PLL), which is demonstrated by equivalent fluorescence intensities as the untreated control. However, matched concentrations of PLL alone caused a significant reduction in the measured fluorescence intensity ( P &lt; 0.0005), which corresponds to significant cytotoxicity and illustrates the importance of the PEG grafting procedure to block the free cationic side chain amines of the opsonin's PLLg -PEG backbone.

## Artificial opsonin enhance phagocytosis

We next investigated the ability of the artificial opsonin to enhance the phagocytosis of live, fluorescently stained S. epidermidis by human neutrophils. As a model bacterial strain, we utilized S. epidermidis RP62A, a biofilm-forming, methicillinresistant strain that was originally isolated from a patient with intravascular catheter-associated sepsis (Christensen et al. 1982, 1983). S. epidermidis RP62A is also known to express the protective exopolysaccharides PGA, PNAG and teichoic acid (Sadovskaya et al. 2005). As shown in Fig. 3, opsonization with PLLg -PEG-Van-Fc significantly enhances the phagocytosis of

Figure 2. Effect of artificial opsonin on neutrophil viability. Neutrophils were incubated in the presence of 28 nM (black bars) or 2.8 µ M(white bars) artificial opsonin (concentrations based on PLL) or matched concentrations of PLL or vancomycin. Cell viability was measured by an alamarBlue assay, which produces a bright red fluorescent signal when cells are metabolically active. Fluorescence data were normalized to the PBS (i.e. untreated) control for comparison purposes. Values are represented as mean ± std dev ( n ≥ 8). P &lt; 0.0005 compared to PBS. Vanco, vancomycin.

Figure 3. Opsonophagocytosis of S. epidermidis RP62A by human neutrophils. AlexaFluor 488-labeled S. epidermidis were opsonized with the indicated treatment and incubated with neutrophils at MOI = 10 for 10 min. The cell-associated fluorescence was then analyzed by flow cytometry. Representative flow cytometry histograms are shown to indicate cell-associated fluorescence of the neutrophil population ( ∼ 10 000 events) after gating cells based on forward and side angle light scatter. The dotted line indicates the threshold for identification of fluorescence-positive cells compared to the untreated (i.e. no bacteria) negative control. All histograms are normalized as % of maximum, i.e. data in each histogram are normalizing to the peak height at mode of that histogram distribution.

S. epidermidis RP62A compared to non-opsonized bacteria. Interestingly, the histograms corresponding to the non-fluorescent subpopulations of treated neutrophils shifts drastically to lower fluorescence intensity compared to the histogram of the untreated (i.e. no bacteria) control neutrophils. The histogram shift is particularly enhanced when bacteria are opsonized with PLLg -PEG-Van-Fc. Investigation of the literature revealed that this phenomenon is caused by activation of the neutrophils

(Hafeman et al. 1982). Resting neutrophils contain large stores of NADPH, a molecule that is highly fluorescent. Activation of the phagocytes due to phagocytosis causes oxidation of the NADPH to NADP + in order to generate superoxide radicals as part of the oxidative burst. Since NADP + is significantly less fluorescent than NADPH, a corresponding decrease is observed in the cell-associated fluorescence of phagocytic neutrophils by flow cytometry.

As shown in Fig. 4, bacterial opsonization with PLLg -PEGVan-Fc doubled the number of neutrophils that contained bacteria (Fig. 4A) and caused a 35% increase in the mean neutrophil-associated fluorescence (i.e . the relative number of ingested bacteria per phagocyte as calculated from fluorescence-positive cells only) (Fig. 4B) compared to nonopsonized bacteria ( P &lt; 0.05). In general, it appears that opsonization with PLLg -PEG-Van-Fc enhanced phagocytosis mainly by both increasing the number of neutrophils that phagocytosed bacteria and with increasing the number of bacteria ingested per phagocyte as seen in Table 1 (phagocytosis efficiency data), which was also observed previously with HL-60 neutrophil-like cells (Katzenmeyer and Bryers 2011).

Interestingly, treatment of S. epidermidis with both PLLg -PEGVan and IgG-Fc slightly enhanced the percentage of phagocytic neutrophils compared to non-opsonized bacteria ( P &lt; 0.05); however, IgG-Fc treatment caused no significant difference in the mean neutrophil-associated fluorescence (Fig. 4). It is possible that the presence of even a small amount of non-specifically ag-

gregated IgG-Fc on the surface of the bacteria can cause an increase in phagocytosis with the highly sensitive neutrophils. In addition, the presence of PLLg -PEG-Van bound to the surface of a bacterium may promote neutrophil activation, which could in

turn upregulate phagocytic receptors and result in a slight increase in phagocytosis compared to non-opsonized bacteria.

## Artificial opsonin enhances oxidative burst

As the production of ROS is an important indicator of antimicrobial activity in professional phagocytes (Fang 2004; Matute et al. 2009), we performed additional studies to investigate the effect of bacterial opsonization with our artificial opsonin on the neutrophil oxidative burst. The production of ROS by the stimulated neutrophils was detected by fluorometry using the oxidation-sensitive fluorophore dihydrorhodamine-123 (DHR123), which is a commonly used technique (Emmendorffer et al. 1990; Trayner et al. 1995; Vowells et al. 1995; Bassøe et al. 2003; Wardman 2007; Freitas et al. 2009) that allows for the simultaneous detection of both intra- and extracellular ROS. Incubation of human neutrophils with DHR-123 significantly increased the fluorescence intensity over background readings without cells (Fig. 5). As a positive control, neutrophils were treated with 1 µ M N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP), a potent bacterial chemotactic peptide that is a known activator of ROS production in phagocytes (Panaro and Mitolo 1999). The N-formyl methionine group, which is present at the N-terminus of bacterial proteins such as the cytolytic phenol-soluble modulins produced by staphylococci (Cheung et al. 2010), is recognized as a pathogen-associated molecular pattern by phagocytes. As expected, fMLP treatment significantly enhanced the oxidative burst compared to untreated cells ( P &lt; 0.0005) as indicated by an 80% increase in the mean fluorescence intensity. In contrast, there was no significant difference between untreated cells and those treated with PLLg -PEG-Van-Fc (i.e . artificial opsonin) only. This finding illustrates that the opsonin alone (i.e . in the absence of bacteria) does not activate the neutrophils to generate ROS, which suggests that undesired harmful side effects (such as inflammation and tissue damage) would be minimized if the opsonin was used in vivo .

Interestingly, live S. epidermidis appeared to interfere with the oxidative burst assay, resulting in no or very low fluorescence signal (data not shown). This phenomenon is likely due to the active production of superoxide dismutase and catalase, enzymes that break down superoxide and hydrogen peroxide, respectively, and/or oxygen consumption by the live bacteria (Bisaillon et al. 1985; Valderas et al. 2002; Karavolos et al. 2003; Foster 2005; Todar 2009). Due to the problems encountered using live bacteria in the assay, the neutrophil oxidative burst was measured using S. aureus Wood BioParticles (chemically and/or heat-killed bacteria lacking protein A). Opsonization of S. aureus BioParticles with PLLg -PEG-Van-Fc caused a 20% increase over the oxidative burst generated by non-opsonized bacteria ( P &lt; 0.005) and a 65% increase over untreated neutrophils ( P &lt; 0.0005). Overall, the results from this study indicate that the artificial opsonin not only enhances the phagocytosis of pathogenic bacteria, but also activates phagocytic neutrophils to increase the production of powerful antimicrobial ROS. Furthermore, the results demonstrate that the artificial opsonin must be bound to bacteria in order to generate an oxidative burst by the neutrophils.

## Artificial opsonins enhance phagocytosis efficiency

Table 1 shows that opsonization with PLLg -PEG-Van-Fc increased both the number of cells ingested by phagocytosis compared to other treatments but also increased the number of bac-

## Artificial opsonin increases neutrophil IL-8 chemokine production during phagocytosis

After confirming that bacterial opsonization with the artificial opsonin enhances both phagocytosis and the oxidative burst by human neutrophils, we next investigated the effect of bacterial opsonization on chemokine production. Specifically, the secretion of the neutrophil chemotactic factor IL-8 was tested, as this chemokine may provide an indication of the ability of the neutrophils to control infection through additional cell recruitment. The presence of IL-8 in the supernatant of phagocytic neutrophils was detected by an ELISA after cells were treated with non-opsonized S. epidermidis RP62A or bacteria that had been opsonized with the artificial opsonin. As shown in Table 2, no IL-8 was detected in the supernatant of untreated neutrophils or those treated with the artificial opsonin alone (i.e. no bacteria). In contrast, neutrophils exposed to the proinflammatory cytokine TNFα produced ∼ 35 pg/mL Il-8. Additionally, treatment with live S. epidermidis (opsonized or not) stimulated the production of IL-8 by the neutrophils in all cases. The amount of IL-8 secreted by the cells was found to be directly correlated with the MOI, or bacteria:phagocyte ratio. Bacterial opsonization was found to significantly increase the amount of IL-8 produced by the neutrophils ( P &lt; 0.005), resulting in IL-8 concentrations higher than that produced by the TNFα positive control. Specifically, there was a 3-fold and 2-fold increase for an MOI of 10 and 30, respectively, compared to non-opsonized bacteria. Similar results were observed for S. aureus BioParticles (data not shown). All together, these results demonstrate that the artificial opsonin must be bound to bacteria in order to stimulate IL8 production in neutrophils and that opsonization significantly increases the neutrophil immune response against bacteria.

## DISCUSSION

Wehave developed an artificial opsonin that has the capacity to recognize a broad group of pathogens (i.e . Gram-positive bacteria) with high specificity. Our artificial opsonin mimics the architecture and effector functions of natural immunoglobulin opsonins. Vancomycin serves as the multivalent antigen-

binding region of our artificial opsonin, while the human IgGFc fragment serves as the immune effector. Here, we show that the artificial opsonin works as an immunostimulant to promote bacterial phagocytosis, generation of an oxidative burst and IL-8 chemokine production by human neutrophils. Bacterial opsonization with IgG is widely recognized to increase both the extent of phagocytosis and the oxidative burst to various pathogens (Gorter et al. 1987; McCloskey and Salo 2000) due to the interaction of IgG-Fc with the phagocyte Fc γ Rs (Casado et al. 1994). Importantly, phagocyte Fc γ Rs have a very low affinity for free IgG-Fc and are not activated unless they bind aggregated IgG bound to a pathogen, thus providing a mechanism for minimizing inflammation and tissue damage when pathogens are not present (Sondermann et al. 2000; Takai 2005; Murphy, Travers and Walport 2008). This mechanism also benefits our purposes in that our artificial opsonin will not bind to phagocytes without first being coated on bacteria, thus minimizing unintended loss of the opsonin and reducing the required dose. Our results from the current study confirm that soluble artificial opsonin alone does not elicit an oxidative burst or production of IL-8 by human neutrophils, as one would expect.

Although we found difficulty in using live bacteria in our oxidative burst assays, one would expect a weak response induced by S. epidermidis compared to S. aureus (Nilsdotter-Augustinsson et al. 2004). Although some groups have found S. epidermidis cell wall antigens (particularly lipoteichoic acid) to induce inflammatory responses (Jones et al. 2005), others have found that opsonization is required for neutrophil activation by intact, live S. epidermidis (Bernardo, Long and Simons 2010). Phagocytosis of opsonized bacteria causes neutrophils to produce chemokines in order recruit additional cells to the site of inflammation (Bazzoni et al. 1991). We found that bacterial opsonization greatly increased production of the chemokine IL-8 by phagocytic neutrophils. IL-8 is recognized by the CXC receptors on neutrophils (Murphy 1997) and thus functions as a means for neutrophil self-

recruitment, which may be an important factor leading to the control of infection. In fact, previous studies have shown that Fc-mediated phagocytosis by human neutrophils is greatly enhanced in response to IL-8 (Detmers et al. 1991). Not surprisingly, S. epidermidis has been found to generate much lower levels of IL-8 by phagocytic neutrophils than S. aureus (Hachicha et al. 1998). This is likely due to the production of high concentrations of leukocyte toxins (e.g. phenol-soluble modulins) by S. aureus (Wang et al. 2007). Recently, it was shown that S. epidermidis has also the ability to produce similar proinflammatory toxins; however, they are only produced in low amounts (Cheung et al. 2010).

Novel therapeutics that enhances the body's immune response to infection, such as the artificial opsonin we have described here, may be beneficial over conventional treatment methods, such as antibiotics and vaccination, for several reasons. The development of antibiotic resistance has become widespread among nosocomial bacterial species (Neu 1992; Smith et al. 2004; McDonald 2006) and is especially prevalent among coagulase-negative staphylococci (John and Harvin 2007). For this reason, the use of antibiotics is becoming less effective and alternative strategies must be explored (Wright 2007). This is especially realized with the recent emergence of numerous multidrug-resistant strains (Leclercq 2009; Pollack 2010; Rivera and Boucher 2011), such as vancomycin-resistant enterococci, methicillin-resistant S. aureus and vancomycinresistant S. aureus . In order to have an advantage over antibiotics, our artificial opsonin must exhibit several key factors. First, the opsonin should exhibit activity against antibioticresistant bacterial strains, including those that are resistant to vancomycin. Second, the opsonin should not induce vancomycin resistance in the targeted bacteria. In our studies, we have shown our artificial opsonin to possess these advantages. We previously demonstrated that a fluorescent derivative of vancomycin is able to target vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus Mu50 and that the molecule's recognition properties are

retained after conjugation to PLLg -PEG. Additionally, Enterococcus faecalis VanB, a bacterial strain with inducible vancomycin resistance, was used to show that the artificial opsonin does not unintentionally induce antibiotic resistance in the targeted bacteria.

Aside from antibiotics, active immunization is another longused strategy to prevent bacterial infections. Unfortunately, immune-evasive strains, such as S. epidermidis and S. aureus , do not mount a strong antibody response in the host and therefore a patient is not protected from recurrent infections (Foster 2005). Other studies have highlighted the difficulty in creating a traditional vaccine against staphylococci (Therrien et al. 2007; Otto 2008; Schaffer and Lee 2009). Additionally, in the case of multispecies infections, antibodies that lack broad recognition may not be effective at clearing an infection. In contrast, the artificial opsonin we have developed exhibits efficacy against a broad range of Gram-positive bacteria, including those that are known to utilize immune evasion mechanisms. Although we have focused our work primarily on the targeting of staphylococci, our artificial opsonin has the capability to recognize most other Gram-positive bacteria as well as some Gram-negative organisms, including Moraxella , Acinetobacter and some species of Neisseria . Aside from medical deviceassociated infections, Gram-positive species cause a variety of other significant infectious diseases (Elsayed and Laupland 2004; Fischetti et al. 2006). Enterococci join staphylococci as frequent causative agents of nosocomial infections, while Listeria and Clostridium species cause well-known food-borne illnesses. Streptococcus pneumoniae , a bacterium that causes many types of pneumococcal diseases, exhibits a virulence mechanism similar to S. epidermidis ; the bacterium surrounds itself with a polysaccharide capsule that helps it evade the host immune system. Due to the vast array of Gram-positive species and their associated diseases, many applications could be envisioned for the treatment and/or detection of Gram-positive pathogens by our artificial opsonin.

The work presented here has focused on the study of planktonic bacteria that would be found upon initial invasion of a wound site. However, bacteria that cause biomaterialsassociated infections can also adhere to an implanted medical device and form biofilms; three-dimensional aggregates of cells embedded within an extracellular matrix of exopolysaccharides and other polymeric compounds. Bacterial biofilms are more resistant to antibiotics and destruction by phagocytes than their planktonic counterparts (Jensen et al. 1992; Høiby et al. 1995; Ceri et al. 1999; Stewart and Costerton 2001; Speziale et al. 2008). Studies by other groups suggest that enhancement of the immune response against biofilms may lead to their eradication (Boelens et al. 2000). Stroh et al. (2011) recently discovered increased clearance of S. aureus biofilms after opsonization with IgG due to enhanced production of ROS by human neutrophils. However, Cerca et al. ( 2006) found that antibodies against PNAG, an exopolysaccharide found on the surface of staphylococci and in the staphylococcal biofilm matrix, were not opsonic due to entrapment of the antibody in the biofilm matrix by an excess of PNAGantigen. The same antibody was able to mediate phagocytosis and killing of PNAG-expressing planktonic cells. The group therefore determined that antibodies utilized against biofilm bacteria would be required to bind close to the surface of the bacteria in order to elicit enhanced antibody-mediated phagocytic killing. Based on these earlier findings, it may be hypothesized that the artificial opsonin we have developed and described here mayhaveefficacy against Gram-positive bacterial biofilms in addition to planktonic bacteria.
