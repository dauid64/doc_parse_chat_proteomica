Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia/thrombosis (HIT) is a serious immune reaction to heparins, characterized by thrombocytopenia and often severe thrombosis with high morbidity and mortality. HIT is mediated by IgG antibodies against heparin/platelet factor 4 antigenic complexes. These complexes are thought to activate platelets leading to thrombocytopenia and thrombosis. Here we show that HIT immune complexes induce NETosis via interaction with Fc γ RIIa on neutrophils and through neutrophil-platelet association. HIT immune complexes induce formation of thrombi containing neutrophils, extracellular DNA, citrullinated histone H3 and platelets in a micro /uniFB02 uidics system and in vivo, while neutrophil depletion abolishes thrombus formation. Absence of PAD4 or PAD4 inhibition with GSK484 abrogates thrombus formation but not thrombocytopenia, suggesting they are induced by separate mechanisms. NETs markers and neutrophils undergoing NETosis are present in HIT patients. Our /uniFB01 ndings demonstrating the involvement of NETosis in thrombosis will modify the current concept of HIT pathogenesis and may lead to new therapeutic strategies.

A dverse drug effects are common in clinical practice and often have negative impact on patient safety. Among these, adverse effects caused by anticoagulants are concerning to clinicians, particularly those caused by heparin, a widely used anticoagulant. Heparin and heparin-derived drugs (including unfractionated heparin, low-molecular-weight heparin and occasionally fondaparinux) may induce an immune reaction, termed heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). HIT is a hypercoagulable state, which often causes severe and extensive thrombosis (both venous and arterial) that results in high morbidity and mortality 1 . The thrombotic complications include severe limb thrombosis and gangrene requiring limb amputation, life-threatening pulmonary embolism, acute myocardial infarction and stroke 2 , and also characteristic thrombosis at distinctive sites (bilateral adrenal infarct, portal and intestinal vein and cerebral sinus thrombosis). It is ironic that patients with HIT develop severe thrombosis when they are also thrombocytopenic and are receiving heparin, a potent anticoagulant.

As an immune drug reaction, HIT occurs more frequently than other drug-induced immune thrombocytopenias; 1 4 -HIT occurs in about 3% of medical patients and about 5% of surgical patients receiving heparin. Furthermore, thrombosis is observed in as many as 50% of untreated HIT patients 3,5 . Data from clinical trials show that despite treatment with non-heparin potent anticoagulants (argatroban and lepirudin) 6 , the devastating clinical outcomes of HIT patients with thrombosis remain unacceptably high (Argatroban-915 7 and HAT-1, 2 and 3 8 studies). The reported incidence of thrombotic gangrene requiring limb amputation ranges from 5.5 to 14.8% and the mortality rate 11.9 to 23.1% 7,8 .

Consequently, there is an urgent clinical need to fully understand the pathogenesis of HIT. In particular, understanding the mechanism(s) of its thrombotic complications will improve management of this limband life-threatening condition and allow novel drugs to be developed for its more ef /uniFB01 cacious treatment. The current concept of the pathogenesis of HIT is that it is mediated by IgG autoantibodies that recognise complexes formed by platelet factor 4 (PF4) and heparin. The heparin/PF4/antibody immune complex, termed HIT immune complex (HIT IC) in this paper, engages Fc γ RIIa on the platelet surface, which leads to platelet activation, release of procoagulant factors, microparticles and platelet clearance 3 . According to current understanding, platelet activation is the main driver of the thrombotic process in HIT. Apart from platelets, other cell types such as monocytes contribute to the immunogenicity of the heparins. Monocytes and endothelial cell involvement has also been reported in the development of thrombosis in HIT 6,9 , but the roles of these cells in mechanisms of thrombosis in HIT are yet to be fully elucidated.

Recently, neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are increasingly being reported in patients with infection and thrombosis associated with various autoimmune and non-immune disorders 10 13 . -NETs are DNA-containing structures released by neutrophils that incorporate intracellular factors, such as histones, myeloperoxidase (MPO) and elastase. NETs have a central role in infection, host defence and thrombosis 14 -16 . NETs promote thrombin generation 17 and, in turn, activated platelets promote NETs formation 18,19 , which are proposed to occur most likely through neutrophil -platelet interaction mediated by P-selectin 20 . NETs contain prothrombotic molecules, such as tissue factor, protein disulphide isomerase, factor XII 21 , von Willebrand Factor (VWF) and /uniFB01 brinogen 22 . However, the presence of NETs or their contribution to hypercoagulability in HIT remains unexplored.

Here, we provide substantial evidence that NETosis occurs in HIT. More importantly our data show that HIT ICs can directly activate neutrophils, inducing these cells to undergo NETosis,

without needing interaction with activated platelets. Furthermore, neutrophil activation and the resulting NETosis are suf /uniFB01 cient and essential for development of thrombosis in HIT, suggesting that neutrophil activation is the major driver of thrombosis in HIT. This is contrary to the present prevailing concept that platelet activation is the key driving force of the thrombotic process in HIT. Our /uniFB01 ndings will contribute to the further understanding of HIT pathogenesis, may change its current concept and lead to new treatments that could improve the clinical outcomes of patients with HIT and thrombosis.

## Results

Increased levels of NETosis markers in HIT patients . To determine whether NETs are generated in HIT, we examined plasma from HIT patients for the presence of NETosis markers: cell-free DNA (cfDNA), MPO, elastase and citrullinated histone H3 (CitH3) relative to normal controls. Signi /uniFB01 cantly increased levels of cfDNA, MPO, elastase and CitH3 were detected in HIT patients ' plasma relative to controls (Fig. 1a -d). Thrombosis (including venous thromboembolism (VTE) and arterial thrombosis) was present in 18 out of 21 HIT patients. Three patients who received heparin as VTE prophylaxis developed thrombocytopenia, but no clinically overt thrombosis (isolated HIT). However, these patients were not screened by imaging investigations for the presence of subclinical thrombi. Plasma levels of VWF were also signi /uniFB01 cantly higher in HIT patients relative to controls (Supplementary Fig. 1a). By western blotting, CitH3 was observed in the plasma of seven HIT patients ( n = 10), while no CitH3 was observed in normal sera ( n = 11) (Fig. 1e).

Next, we examined whether NETs were present in patients with active HIT. Fresh whole blood from HIT patients with acute HIT or normal controls was analysed by /uniFB02 ow cytometry 23 for the presence of NETs (for gating strategy see Supplementary Fig. 1b). As shown in Fig. 1f, neutrophils (backgated from CD15 + CD16 + population (Neut) in Fig. 1g, and shown as a side and forward scatter plot) from HIT patients included a second population of high-scatter cells, which were not present in healthy controls (Fig. 1f, g, LDG). These enlarged cells have been described as activated neutrophils 24 or low-density granulocytes (LDGs) 25 and have been observed in pathological conditions. We con /uniFB01 rmed the presence of LDGs in fresh blood treated with HIT IgG and heparin (Supplementary Fig. 1c). Moreover, a large proportion of neutrophils were incorporated in neutrophil -platelet aggregates in HIT patients relative to controls (CD16 + CD41 + events) (Fig. 1h). NETting neutrophils, de /uniFB01 ned as MPO + CitH3 + events within the CD15 + CD16 + population were also abundant in HIT samples, while signs of NETosis were undetectable in healthy controls (Fig. 1i). Fluorescence minus one controls are shown in Supplementary Fig. 1d. These /uniFB01 ndings suggest that NETs may be involved in the pathogenesis of HIT.

## HIT IgG induces NETosis and NETs-containing thrombi .

Following detection of NETosis markers in HIT plasma and the presence of NETosis in HIT patients, we sought to determine whether plasma from HIT patients plus heparin was capable of inducing DNA release by puri /uniFB01 ed neutrophils. All patient samples tested ( n = 21) induced DNA release relative to normal controls ( n = 18) (Supplementary Fig. 1e). This prompted us to examine the effect of puri /uniFB01 ed HIT IgG plus heparin on whole blood. We observed changes in neutrophils (Fig. 2a, gate R1 and Fig. 2b) similar to those found in fresh blood of patients with active HIT (Fig. 1f). There was strong induction of neutrophil -platelet aggregates within an hour of treatment with HIT IgG and heparin (0.5 U/ml), but not in blood treated with heparin alone or normal IgG plus heparin (Fig. 2c, d).

portion of neutrophils in HIT IgG-treated blood were also MPO + CitH3 + , which is indicative of NETs induction (Fig. 2e, f). Both neutrophil -platelet aggregates and NETs occurred only at therapeutic doses of heparin (0.5 U/ml) and were completely inhibited by supra therapeutic heparin concentration (100 U/ml) (Supplementary Fig. 1f and Fig. 1g), indicating that induction of

NETs is dependent on the formation of heparin/PF4/HIT IgG complexes, where high heparin concentration disperses the complexes 26 . Therefore, inhibition of neutrophil -platelet complexes and NETs formation (MPO + CitH3 + cells) in the presence of high heparin concentrations is most likely due to the absence of HIT immune complexes. Although heparin can destabilise

already formed NETs by removing histones from the secreted DNA 22 , this is not observed at low-dose heparin (0.5 U/ml). High heparin concentration (100 U/ml) can disrupt HIT antibody -PF4 heparin complexes, but does not degrade NETs 27 . -To investigate if NETs were generated during thrombus formation, we reconstituted the HIT condition in a micro /uniFB02 uidics system using microchannels coated with VWF. Fresh whole blood was incubated with puri /uniFB01 ed HIT IgG plus heparin at 37 °C and perfused into the microchannels at arteriole shear stress (67 dyne/cm 2 ) 28 . The HIT condition reconstituted in this system led to signi /uniFB01 cant thrombus formation. As illustrated in time-lapse movies, the thrombi were rich in platelets (Supplementary movie 1) and neutrophils (Supplementary movie 2) and produced substantial amounts of the extracellular DNA (Supplementary movie 3). Fluorescent images captured during video acquisition show thrombi composed of nucleated cells, extracellular DNA, /uniFB01 brin and platelets (Supplementary Fig. 2a). At the end of the experiment (30 min of blood /uniFB02 ow), the remaining thrombi were /uniFB01 xed and examined by confocal microscopy. DNA networks (Sytox + ), CitH3 + , Hoechst + -nucleated cells and platelet aggregates were observed in the clots (Fig. 2g). Quantitative analysis of percentage area coverage versus time shows marked deposition of extracellular DNA (Fig. 2h), platelets (Fig. 2i) and neutrophils (Fig. 2j) on VWF-coated microchannels for HIT compared with control. Extracellular DNA was found in conjunction with extensive /uniFB01 brin deposition within the thrombus (Supplementary Fig. 2b). Addition of DNase I resulted in rapid fading of the Sytox /uniFB02 uorescence, thus con /uniFB01 rming the presence of extracellular DNA in the thrombus (Supplementary movie 4 and Supplementary Fig. 3a, b). Therefore, HIT IgG ICs promote the formation of neutrophil -platelet aggregates and NETosis in vitro and induce the formation of thrombi containing neutrophils, extracellular DNA and CitH3 under /uniFB02 ow conditions.

NETs formation is a feature of HIT in vivo . The observations described above prompted us to explore the role of NETs in vivo in a mouse model of HIT. The HIT condition can be recapitulated using double transgenic mice expressing human platelet factor 4 (hPF4) and the R 131 isoform of human Fc γ RIIa 29 on their platelets to allow interaction with human IgG. Fc γ RIIa also interacts with mouse IgG1 and IgG2 immune complexes 30 . These mice ( Fc γ RIIA + / hPF4 + ) also express Fc γ RIIa on other cells, including neutrophils (Supplementary Fig. 3c) and macrophages 31 . Development of HIT in these mice was evaluated by the extent of thrombocytopenia and, more speci /uniFB01 cally, by the degree of thrombus deposition in the lungs. Fc γ RIIA + / hPF4 + mice were treated with intravenous injections of the HIT-like monoclonal antibody KKO or IgG puri /uniFB01 ed from HIT patients ' plasma followed by intraperitoneal administration of heparin (1 U/g). Mouse platelets were labelled in vivo with anti-CD42c Dylight 649 antibody. Administration of KKO or HIT IgG led to a signi /uniFB01 cant decrease in platelet numbers (Fig. 3a) and a marked reduction in body temperature (Supplementary Fig. 3d) (other systemic reactions such as unresponsiveness to external stimuli were also observed together with hypothermia, features that have been described in patients with HIT). Examination of isolated, /uniFB01 xed lungs by micro CT scanning demonstrated signi /uniFB01 cant accumulation of /uniFB02 uorescence (labelled platelets) in mice treated with KKO or HIT IgG plus heparin, indicative of pulmonary thromboembolism (Fig. 3b). Thrombi were not observed in animals treated with control mouse IgG or normal human IgG plus heparin (Fig. 3b). Examination of /uniFB01 xed lung sections by /uniFB02 uorescence microscopy and H&amp;E staining con /uniFB01 rmed the presence of thrombi lodged in pulmonary vessels of KKO- and HIT IgGtreated mice (Fig. 3c). These thrombi are /uniFB01 brin rich and

contain both scattered and clustered leucocytes (Fig. 3d and Supplementary Fig. 4). To determine if NETosis occurs during HIT, circulating markers of NETs were quanti /uniFB01 ed in treated Fc γ RIIA + /hPF4 + mice. We observed signi /uniFB01 cant increase in cfDNA and MPO activity in the plasma of mice treated with KKO or HIT IgG plus heparin (Fig. 3e). Assessment of plasma proteins by western blot showed the presence of CitH3 in KKO- or HIT IgG plus heparin-treated Fc γ RIIA + /hPF4 + mice but not in animals administered with control IgG plus heparin (Fig. 3f). Consistent with these observations, immunostaining of lung sections demonstrated evidence of NETosis in HIT IgGand KKOinduced thrombi. MPO-containing cells were present in plateletrich clots (Fig. 3g). Some neutrophils appeared non-activated, with distinctive lobulated nucleus (Fig. 3h, arrowhead), while others showed signs of nuclear decondensation, which is a characteristic of NETosis 32,33 (Fig. 3h, arrow). Ly6G-positive cells (a surface marker for murine neutrophils) were the most abundant nucleated cells within the clots, and importantly both CitH3 and extracellular DNA were detected within clots (Fig. 3i). Collectively, these results show that NETosis is involved with HIT development in Fc γ RIIA + /hPF4 + mice and reiterate the observations in HIT patients and in ex vivo HIT reconstitution assays.

Direct and indirect activation of neutrophils by HIT IgG . HIT ICs activate platelets via Fc γ RIIa. We examined NETs formation by neutrophils in the presence or absence of platelets in the micro /uniFB02 uidics system (the purity of isolated neutrophils is shown in Supplementary Fig. 5a -c). In VWF-coated microchannels and in the presence of KKO plus heparin, neutrophils plus platelets resulted in the formation of clots containing platelets, neutrophils, extracellular DNA and CitH3 (Fig. 4a). To explore the events that lead to NETosis in HIT, we next investigated whether platelets activated with HIT IgG ICs induced release of DNA by neutrophils. Washed platelets treated with HIT IgG, puri /uniFB01 ed PF4 and heparin were added to puri /uniFB01 ed autologous neutrophils at a 20:1 platelet to neutrophil ratio (physiological ratio). The production of extracellular DNA, which is indicative of NETosis 34 , was monitored by live cell microscopy. HIT IgG-activated platelets elicited expansive DNA release by neutrophils (Fig. 4b). Induction of NETosis by HIT IgG pre-treated platelets depends on neutrophil -platelet association through P-selectin, since blockage of this interaction with anti-P-selectin (CD62p) or antiPSGL-1 (CD162) antibodies prevents DNA release (Fig. 4b). Activated platelets have been implicated in NETs formation in other conditions 20,35,36 .

Unexpectedly, isolated neutrophils resuspended in autologous plasma and incubated with KKO plus heparin formed cell aggregates and released extensive DNA webs and CitH3 when perfused on P-selectin-coated microchannels, demonstrating that under /uniFB02 ow conditions neutrophils undergo NETosis upon exposure to ICs formed by KKO (surrogate for HIT IgG), PF4 and heparin in the absence of platelets (Fig. 4c and Supplementary movies 5, 6). Quantitative analysis of percentage area coverage versus time using puri /uniFB01 ed neutrophils and patient s HIT ' IgG plus heparin shows deposition of extracellular DNA and neutrophils on P-selectin-coated microchannels (Fig. 4d). This deposition is not observed in the presence of the Fc γ RIIablocking antibody IV.3 or with normal IgG plus heparin (Fig. 4d). These data indicate that HIT ICs can stimulate neutrophils both directly and indirectly via activated platelets, both through Fc γ RIIa to form extracellular traps. Moreover, /uniFB01 brin-rich clots can be formed in platelet-depleted Fc γ RIIA + /hPF4 + mice (Supplementary Fig. 5d -g), suggesting that at least in the animal model of HIT, platelets are not essential for clot formation. As in the micro /uniFB02 uidics system experiments shown in Fig. 4c, live cell

imaging of neutrophils in the absence of platelets also released extracellular DNA when incubated with HIT IgG, PF4 and heparin in static conditions (Fig. 5a). No signi /uniFB01 cant extracellular DNA release was detected when using normal IgG, PF4 and heparin (Fig. 5a, Supplementary Fig. 6 and Supplementary movies 7, 8), substantiating the previous /uniFB01 nding that HIT ICs

speci /uniFB01 cally activate neutrophils and induce NETs formation. The HIT immune complex associates with neutrophils via Fc γ RIIa since coincubation with the blocking antibody IV.3 prevents KKO -or HIT IgG -neutrophil association (Supplementary Fig. 7a, b). In static conditions, puri /uniFB01 ed neutrophils and platelets released DNA after treatment with HIT IgG, PF4 and heparin, and this

was inhibited by IV.3 and by the presence of the NETosis inhibitor (reversible peptidylarginine deiminase 4 (PAD4) inhibitor) GSK484 37 (Fig. 5a). PF4 alone has been proposed to stimulate NETosis in the presence of platelets 38 ; however, we did not observe NETosis after treatment of neutrophils with normal IgG plus PF4 and heparin (Fig. 5a and Supplementary Fig. 6 and Supplementary movies 9, 10).

We then examined the effect of inhibition on NETs formation in whole blood by /uniFB02 ow cytometry. Compared with vehicle control, neutrophil -platelet aggregates in whole blood were signi /uniFB01 cantly reduced by antibody blockage of P-selectin (antiCD62p), PSGL-1 (anti-CD162) or Fc γ RIIA (IV.3 antibody) (Fig. 5b), while addition of DNase I or GSK484 did not affect cell -cell association (Fig. 5b). Examination of NETosis after 5 h of treatment at 37 °C shows that the PAD4 inhibitor GSK48 and Fc γ RIIA neutralisation with IV.3 antibody strongly inhibited NETosis (Fig. 5c), while blockage of neutrophil -platelet interaction with anti-CD62p or anti-CD162 had only a modest effect on NETosis. This supports the previous /uniFB01 ndings (shown in Figs. 4c and 5a) that neutrophils can undergo NETosis following direct stimulation with HIT ICs in the absence of direct neutrophil -platelet interactions.

NETosis is required for ex vivo thrombus formation in HIT . To dissect the function of NETosis in thrombus formation in HIT, we /uniFB01 rst examined the role of extracellular DNA on clot formation by pre-digestion of NETs with DNase I. Fresh whole blood was incubated with KKO monoclonal antibody and heparin plus DNase I at 37 °C and perfused into VWF-coated microchannels. The presence of DNase I not only prevented DNA accumulation but also strongly inhibited neutrophil and platelet deposition comparable with the Fc γ RIIA blocker, IV.3 (Fig. 5d, e). To con /uniFB01 rm the role of neutrophils in thrombus formation, we compared the degree of neutrophil, DNA and platelet accumulation in the micro /uniFB02 uidics system using whole blood, neutrophildepleted blood and neutrophil-depleted blood reconstituted with autologous neutrophils. As expected, extensive deposition of neutrophils, extracellular DNA and platelets were observed with whole blood (Fig. 5f). Notably, absence of neutrophils prevented formation of extracellular DNA and markedly inhibited platelet deposition (Fig. 5f). Conversely, addition of autologous puri /uniFB01 ed neutrophils to neutrophil-depleted blood restored neutrophil, DNA and platelet accumulation (Fig. 5f). Accumulation of platelets, neutrophils and DNA in neutrophil-depleted and in reconstituted blood are represented in Fig. 5g. These experiments support the proposal that neutrophils and NETs are required for

thrombus formation in HIT, a novel /uniFB01 nding that provides important new knowledge of thrombus formation in HIT.

NETs-dependent thrombosis in HIT . To determine the role of NETosis in thrombus formation in vivo, we induced the HIT condition in Fc γ RIIA + /hPF4 + mice in the presence of DNase I, anti-P-selectin antibody (anti-CD62p) and the NETs inhibitor GSK484, which is known to inhibit NETosis in mouse neutrophils 37,39 . Effector de /uniFB01 cient IV.3 (aglycosylated IV.3, agIV.3) was also used as a HIT-blocking control (unmodi /uniFB01 ed IV.3 cannot be used in mice expressing Fc γ RIIA because it leads to thrombocytopenia and anaphylactic reactions 40 ). Thrombocytopenia (Fig. 5h) and decrease in body temperature (Supplementary Fig. 8a) were not speci /uniFB01 cally affected by the presence of GSK484, DNase I or anti-CD62p antibody. The extent of cfDNA in circulation was reduced by all inhibitors, except anti-CD62p, 1 h and 3 h after treatment (Fig. 5i). Unlike the effect on platelet count, inhibition of NETs formation by GSK484 caused a dramatic reduction in thrombus deposition in mouse lungs (Fig. 5j). Unlike GKS484, and in agreement with the hypothesis that neutrophil -platelet interactions are dispensable for HIT IgG-induced -NETosis, mice treated with anti-CD62p antibody did not show inhibition of thrombus formation (Fig. 5j). As expected, neutralization of Fc γ RIIA by agIV.3 completely abolished thrombus deposition in the lungs. Inhibition by DNase I was less effective, perhaps due to protection of the NETs by HIT ICs 27 . Moreover, CitH3 was absent in the plasma of GSK484- or agIV.3-treated mice (Fig. 5k). The detected levels of CitH3 were not affected by the presence of anti-CD62p antibody (Fig. 5k), while DNase I treatment reduced the levels of CitH3 in plasma (Fig. 5k). Collectively, these results indicate that inhibition of platelet and neutrophil activation by blockade of Fc γ RIIA or inhibition of NETs formation with GSK484 is suf /uniFB01 cient to prevent thrombus formation in vivo. Nuclear decondensation is driven by PAD4, therefore PAD4-de /uniFB01 cient mice represent a robust tool to study NETosis in vivo. To ascertain the role NETosis in HIT, we used PAD4-de /uniFB01 cient Fc γ RIIA + /hPF4 + mice ( Fc γ RIIA + / hPF4 + /PAD4 - -/ ). Absence of PAD4 in these mice was determined by western blot (Supplementary Fig. 8b). In addition, the number of neutrophils and platelets in Fc γ RIIA + /hPF4 + / PAD4 -/ + and Fc γ RIIA + /hPF4 + /PAD4 - -/ mice were comparable with Fc γ RIIA + /hPF4 + /PAD4 + + / animals (Supplementary Fig. 8c). PAD4 de /uniFB01 ciency did not protect mice from HIT IgGinduced thrombocytopenia (Fig. 6a), which is consistent with /uniFB01 ndings using GSK484. The presence of cfDNA, however, was reduced in Fc γ RIIA + /hPF4 + /PAD4 - -/ mice (Fig. 6b) and the

extensive thrombus deposition observed in lungs from WT mice ( Fc γ RIIA + /hPF4 + /PAD4 + + / ) was absent in PAD4 de /uniFB01 cient mice (Fig. 6c, d). In contrast to the strong circulating levels of total H3 and CitH3 in WT mice, markedly low levels of total H3 and no CitH3 were detected in Fc γ RIIA + /hPF4 + / PAD4 - -/ animals (Fig. 6e). Absence of PAD4 considerably protected treated mice from the drastic decrease in body

Of note, isolation of mouse peripheral blood mononuclear cells by gradient centrifugation demonstrated the presence of LDGs only in Fc γ RIIA + /hPF4 + /PAD4 + + / mice (Supplementary Fig. 8e). These cells were virtually absent in Fc γ RIIA + /hPF4 + /PAD4 -/ + and Fc γ RIIA + /hPF4 + / PAD4 - -/ mice (Supplementary Fig. 8e, middle and lower

panels). Thus, our data demonstrate that HIT IgG activates neutrophils to induce NETosis and that NETs are essential for thrombus formation in HIT.

## Discussion

Thrombosis is the most critical aspect of HIT that contributes to morbidity and mortality 41,42 . Catastrophic thrombotic complications such as limb gangrene and mortality rate have not decreased signi /uniFB01 cantly despite treatment with non-heparin anticoagulants, such as argatroban and lepirudin 7,8 . There is an unmet clinical need to explore new mechanisms involved in the development of thrombosis in HIT.

In this study, we have shown the occurrence of NETosis in HIT by demonstrating markers of neutrophil activation and NETosis (increased MPO and elastase, extracellular DNA and CitH3) in HIT patients ' plasma, and activated and NETting neutrophils and increased neutrophil -platelet aggregates in blood of patients with HIT. These NETosis markers were also present in the plasma of Fc γ RIIa + /hPF4 + mice when the HIT condition was recreated by administration of HIT IgG antibodies and heparin. In addition, neutrophils with nuclear decondensation (characteristic of NETosis) together with CitH3 and extracellular DNA were observed in platelet-rich thrombi in the lungs of these mice with HIT. These markers of NETosis were also detected in thrombi generated ex vivo under /uniFB02 ow conditions (micro /uniFB02 uidics) as well as static conditions (live cell microscopy and /uniFB02 ow cytometry).

Importantly, we found that HIT ICs can directly activate neutrophils by two pathways: (1) direct activation of neutrophils via Fc γ RIIa, and (2) by activation of platelets via Fc γ RIIa, followed by the interaction and activation of neutrophils via Pselectin and PSGL-1. The second pathway is not essential for HIT ICs to generate NETs, as anti-CD62p and anti-CD162 antibodies did not block NETosis induced by HIT ICs. The P-selectin/PSGL1 interaction is not the only molecular mediator of neutrophil/ platelet association 43 . However, in our experiments, blockage of CD62p or CD162 was suf /uniFB01 cient to markedly inhibit neutrophil/ platelet interaction induced by HIT antibodies and to prevent DNA release by neutrophils in the presence of HIT ICs-activated platelets. This suggests that in HIT this is likely to be the main form of interaction, but in other situations other pathways may be involved.

The results presented here also show that the activation of neutrophils and the formation of NETs are critical for thrombus generation in HIT. In the HIT murine model using Fc RIIa γ + /hPF4 + mice, treatment with DNase I decreased thrombus formation while administration of PAD4 inhibitor GSK484 blocked NETosis and also markedly reduced thrombus formation. PAD4-de cient mice failed to develop thrombi when they were /uniFB01

injected with HIT antibodies and heparin. Furthermore, digestion of DNA prior to perfusion of whole blood into microchannels or neutrophil depletion abrogates platelet and neutrophil accumulation. These /uniFB01 ndings are consistent with reports that NETs fuel thrombus formation, trap platelets and stimulate /uniFB01 brin deposition 22 . In HIT, thrombocytopenia can occur alone or with thrombosis 44 . Our results indicate that thrombocytopenia and thrombosis are two separable processes, but both are consequences of HIT immune complex activity. Binding of the complexes to platelets via Fc γ RIIa leads to thrombocytopenia which occurs even in the absence of NETosis (Fig. 5h and Fig. 6a). The thrombocytopenia in HIT 42 is likely to be due to removal of HIT immune complex-coated platelets by macrophage phagocytosis 45 . In contrast, thrombosis in HIT requires neutrophil activation and, more speci /uniFB01 cally, the formation of NETs. These observations are contrary to the current prevailing concept that thrombosis is mainly driven by platelet activation. In fact, /uniFB01 brin-containing clots were found in lungs of platelet-depleted mice treated with HIT IgG and heparin. These /uniFB01 ndings have clinical signi /uniFB01 cance since effective treatment of thrombosis in HIT is still an unresolved challenge 8,46 . This demonstration that thrombosis in HIT is mediated by NETosis may, in part, explain why anticoagulation alone is not suf /uniFB01 cient for treatment of thrombosis. Consequently, inhibition of NETosis represents a potential intervention for the prevention and reduction of thrombosis in HIT.

Recently, Gollomp et al. 27 also studied NETosis in HIT and concluded that neutrophils and NETosis may be implicated in the pathology of HIT. Our /uniFB01 ndings further those observations by providing strong evidence that HIT IC-induced NETosis is essential for thrombus development in HIT. These investigators showed in a laser injury model using Fc γ RIIa + /hPF4 + mice that neutrophils are present in venular thrombi in the presence of KKO 27 . The size of the thrombi appears to depend on NETosis, since clots were smaller in PAD4 - -/ mice or in animals pretreated with DNase I 27 . Our results indicate not only the presence of neutrophils in HIT IC-induced thrombi, but also abundant NETs, CitH3 and MPO. In addition, we found that thrombus formation induced by HIT or KKO ICs was substantially abolished by inhibition of NETosis with GSK484.

In conclusion, our data show that in HIT, thrombocytopenia and thrombosis are separable events (see diagram in Supplementary Fig. 9) and that HIT ICs induce the formation of neutrophil -platelet aggregates, indirectly activate neutrophils and promote NETosis which is an essential step in the thrombotic process. Importantly, NETosis is also induced by HIT ICs by direct activation of neutrophils through Fc γ RIIa without the need for platelet participation. Formation of thrombi in HIT mice is

inhibited by blockage of NETosis. Consistent with this, we found that PAD4-de cient /uniFB01 Fc γ RIIa + /hPF4 + mice are protected from HIT antibody-induced thrombosis. We conclude that neutrophil activation and the resulting NETosis are major drivers of thrombosis in HIT, and the inhibition of NETs could be exploited therapeutically. Thus, anti-NETs-targeted therapy alone or preferably in conjunction with non-heparin anticoagulants may be more ef /uniFB01 cacious and would prevent disastrous thrombotic consequences, such as limb amputation and death, and signi /uniFB01 cantly improve patient outcomes.

## Methods

Human samples . Plasma was collected from patients with a clinical diagnosis of HIT, and positive for laboratory tests (HIT ELISA and serotonin release assay). The diagnosis of HIT was made according to the criteria outlined previously 1 . Eighteen of the 21 patients with HIT had arterial/venous thrombosis; three had only thrombocytopenia without thrombosis (isolated HIT). The study was approved by the University of New South Wales ' Human Research Ethics Committee (HC12093) and the South Eastern Sydney Local Health District Human Research Ethics Committee (17/349 LNR/18/POWH/45). Blood and plasma from all donors were obtained with informed consent. Plasma samples were stored at -80 °C until use.

Antibodies . Total HIT IgG was puri /uniFB01 ed from patients ' plasma with Protein G Agarose (Roche Mannheim, Germany). Resin (2 ml for 10 ml of plasma) was packed into a chromatography column (1.5 cm × 10 cm; Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA), and the puri /uniFB01 cation procedure was conducted with AKTA puri /uniFB01 er chromatography system (GE Healthcare). The eluted peak fractions were pooled and concentrated using ultracentrifugal unit (10 kDa) (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). Activity of puri /uniFB01 ed HIT IgG was determined by platelet aggregation and serotonin release assays.

Cell culture and antibody puri /uniFB01 cation . Monoclonal antibody-producing hybridoma cells for IV.3 were obtained from ATCC ® (clone HB-217 TM ) and for KKO were kindly provided by Prof. Gowthami Arepally (Duke University). Cells were cultured in DMEM medium containing 10% FBS. The culture was maintained in a humidi /uniFB01 ed incubator at an aeration of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Cells were cultured for 24 h in serum-free DMEM before collection of antibody-containing supernatant. Antibodies were puri /uniFB01 ed by protein G sepharose af /uniFB01 nity chromatography.

Reagents . Reagents used for NETosis experiments were purchased with low endotoxin levels (i.e. &lt; 0.01 EU/µg of protein) e.g. Ultra-LEAF puri /uniFB01 ed CD62p (148308, BioLegend). Endotoxin levels were also con /uniFB01 rmed with Pierce LAL Chromogenic Endotoxin Quantitation Kit (88282, Thermo Scienti /uniFB01 c).

HIT mouse model . Double transgenic Fc γ RIIA + /hPF4 + mice were generated by crossing transgenic mice expressing the R 131 isoform of human Fc γ RIIA with mice transgenic for human PF4 29 . These mice were generously provided by Dr Steven McKenzie (Thomas Jefferson University).

PAD4 - -/ mice were produced by the Mouse Engineering Garvan/ABR (MEGA) Facility (Moss Vale and Sydney, NSW, Australia) by CRISPR/Cas9 gene targeting in C57BL/6J mouse embryos following established molecular and animal husbandry techniques 47 . A single-guide RNA (sgRNA) was designed to target within exon 2 of mouse Padi4 gene (target with protospacer-associated motif underlined: CCGAAGGTTGTGTAGCCCTTAGG) and coinjected with polyadenylated Cas9 mRNA into C57BL/6J zygotes. Microinjected embryos were cultured overnight and introduced into pseudo-pregnant foster mothers. Pups were screened by PCR and Sanger sequencing of ear-punch DNA, and a founder mouse identi /uniFB01 ed that carried a 10 bp frame-shift deletion in exon 2. The targeted allele was maintained by breeding on a C57BL/6J background. PAD4 - -/ mice were crossed with Fc γ RIIA + /hPF4 + mice to generate Fc γ RIIA + /hPF4 + /PAD4 - -/ animals. Multiple mice between 8 and 12 weeks of age were randomly selected and analysed as biological replicates. All analyses were performed unblinded except for platelet counts and histology analyses. No power calculations were done for animal experiments. All animal experiments were approved by the Animal Care and Ethics Committee of the University of New South Wales.

Quanti /uniFB01 cation of NETosis markers . Plasma levels of cfDNA were measured using a /uniFB02 uorometric assay for double-stranded DNA Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA Assay kit (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer s instructions. Plasma levels of citrul-' linated histone H3, human myeloperoxidase, neutrophil elastase and VWF were determined by ELISA with Citrullinated Histone H3 (Clone 11D3) ELISA Kit (Cayman Chemicals), Human Myeloperoxidase Quantikine ELISA Kit (R&amp;D Systems), Human PMN Elastase Platinum ELISA (eBioscience, San Diego, CA) or by in-house ELISA using sheep anti-human VWF (Abcam, ab11713) for coating followed by detection with polyclonal rabbit anti-human VWF-HRP (Dako, P0226), respectively.

Cell isolation and in vitro NETosis . EDTA-anticoagulated blood was used to isolate neutrophils using EasySep Direct Human Neutrophil Isolation Kit (19666; StemCell Technologies) following the manufacturer s instructions. Neutrophils ' were depleted from whole human blood with CD15 microbeads from Miltenyi Biotech following the manufacturer s instructions. Purity was assessed by ' /uniFB02 ow cytometry. Washed platelets were prepared from citrate-anticoagulated blood 48 . For live cell imaging, cells were treated with puri /uniFB01 ed HIT IgG or control IgG, puri /uniFB01 ed PF4 and heparin. HIT IgG-stimulated cells were labelled with CellTracker ™ Deep Red dye or CellTracker ™ Orange CMTMR Dye (Invitrogen). Puri /uniFB01 ed autologous neutrophils were reacted with platelets at a 1:20 ratio. The total DNA and extracellular DNA were stained with Hoechst 33342 (145333, Sigma) and Sytox ® Green nucleic acid stain (Invitrogen), respectively. Inhibitors included: IV.3, GSK484 (Cayman chemicals), anti-CD62p (304902, BioLegend), anti-CD162 (328802, BioLegend) and DNase I (18047019, Invitrogen).

Ex vivo micro /uniFB02 uidics reconstitution of HIT . Vena8 Fluoro + ™ biochip microchannels were coated with VWF (Haematologic Technologies United BioResearch Products Pty Ltd) or P-selectin (R&amp;D systems) at a concentration of 200 μ g/ml at 4 °C overnight. Microchannels were washed with PBS then blocked with PBS/1% BSA for 30 min. Citrated whole blood was diluted 1:2 with PBS, supplemented with puri /uniFB01 ed IgG (HIT IgG 3 mg/ml, normal IgG 3 mg/ml, KKO 1 mg/ml) and heparin (0.5 U/ml) and incubated for 1.5 h at 37 °C. Before perfusion, the blood was stained with combinations of the following reagents: Hoechst 33342 (3 μ g/ml), Sytox green (0.3 μ M), anti-CD41 Alexa 647 (15 μ g/ml), anti-CD15 Alexa 647 (15 μ g/ml), anti/uniFB01 brin Alexa 594 (30 μ g/ml), anti-CitH3 Alexa 594 (30 μ g/ml). The assay was performed at 37 °C in a Vena /uniFB02 ux micro /uniFB02 uidics device (Cellix Ltd. Dublin, Ireland) in the absence and presence of inhibitors (DNase I (160 U/ml), IV.3 (20 μ g/ml) at a /uniFB02 uid shear stress of 67 dyne/cm 2 (shear rate 1500 s -1 ) for up to 30 min. Flow chambers were mounted on a /uniFB02 uorescent microscope (Zeiss Axio Observer.A1) and /uniFB02 uorescence images from different microscopic /uniFB01 elds were captured in real time with a Q-Imaging EXi Blue ™ camera (Q-Imaging, Surry, BC, Canada) driven by Vena /uniFB02 ux software (Cellix Ltd. Dublin, Ireland). Accumulation of DNA, platelets and neutrophils was measured by calculating the surface area coverage with ImagePro Premier 9.1 software (Media Cybernetics, Inc, Rockville, MD, USA). Selected channels were perfused with 2% paraformaldehyde to /uniFB01 x the samples for subsequent imaging by confocal microscopy.

IVIS spectrum CT imaging . Following euthanasia, the thoracic cavity of the mouse was exposed through a midline sternotomy. Lung perfusion was conducted using a 25-gauge needle with 1.5 ml PBS followed by 0.5 ml 10% formalin (HT501128; Sigma). The lungs were gently teased from their pleural adhesions and placed into 10% formalin. Fluorescence in the lungs was imaged within 2 h of harvesting using the IVIS Spectrum (Perkin Elmer) with 570/680 nm (background) and 640/680 /uniFB01 lter sets. Image Math in Living Image 4.5.5 software (Perkin Elmer) was used to calculate /uniFB02 uorescence in radiant ef /uniFB01 ciency.

Histology . Fixed lungs were paraf /uniFB01 n embedded, sectioned at 4 microns and mounted onto slides. Slides were subjected to H&amp;E or Carstairs staining. For immunohistochemistry, slides were deparaf /uniFB01 nized and rehydrated, followed by 20min heat-induced antigen retrieval with Tris/EDTA pH 9. The slides were washed with TBS/0.025% Triton X-100 then blocked with 10% donkey or goat serum with 1% BSA in TBS. Slides were probed with the following primary antibodies: antiCitH3 (ab5103; Abcam), anti-Ly6G (127602; Biolegend) and anti-MPO (ab9535; Abcam). The secondary antibodies used were donkey anti-rabbit IgG, Alexa 647 (ab150075, Abcam), Af /uniFB01 niPure donkey anti-rabbit IgG, Alexa 488 (711-545-152; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) or goat anti-rat IgG, Alexa 594 (ab150160; Abcam). Glass coverslips were mounted onto the slides using Vectashield antifade mounting medium with DAPI (H-1200; Vector Laboratories) and imaged with /uniFB02 uorescence or confocal microscopy.

Confocal and /uniFB02 uorescence microscopy . Live or /uniFB01 xed cells (isolated neutrophils with or without platelets, and thrombi) in biochip microchannels or eight-well Nunc Lab-Tek II chambers and lung sections were stained and imaged with the objectives described in the corresponding /uniFB01 gure legends with a confocal laserscanning microscope (Leica TCS SP8) running Leica s LAS X software. Fluorescent ' images were taken with the objective indicated in the corresponding /uniFB01 gure legend with a Zeiss Axio Vert.A1 microscope and Zen software version 1.1.1.0. Transmission images were taken with a Zeiss Axioskop microscope running Zen software version 2.3.64.0.

Flow cytometry . Citrated blood freshly collected from HIT patients and healthy donors was diluted in PBS and stained with anti-CD15 (Alexa 647, BD 562369), anti-CD16 (APC-Cy7, BD 557758), anti-CD41a (V450, BD 561425), anticitrullinated histone H3 (ab5103), anti-MPO (PE, BD 341642) and Af /uniFB01 nipure donkey anti-rabbit (Alexa 488, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories 711545152) antibodies. Samples were /uniFB01 xed with paraformaldehyde and analysed by /uniFB02 ow cytometry (CantoII, BD Bioscience). Citrated blood from healthy donors was also treated in vitro with HIT or control antibodies, labelled and analysed as described above. Fluorescent counting beads (Invitrogen C36950) were used to derive

absolute cell numbers by /uniFB02 ow cytometry following the manufacturer s instructions. ' Platelet counts from animal experiments were determined by the number of events acquired in 60 s. LDG and monocytes from human and mouse experiments isolated using Histopaque separation media (Sigma) 49 were identi /uniFB01 ed using antiCD15 (Alexa 647, BD 562369), anti-CD16 (APC-Cy7, BD 557758, anti-CD14 (V500, BD 561391), anti-Ly6G (V450, BD560603) and anti-CD11b (APC, BioLegend 101212).

Western blotting . Albumin was depleted from plasma samples as described in the Pierce ™ Albumin Depletion Kit protocol (85160, Thermo Scienti /uniFB01 c). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on 4 -20% polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad) and stained with Coomassie Blue or Ponceau S. Western blot analyses 50 were carried out as follows: membranes were probed with the primary antibodies: anti-CitH3 (dilution 1:1000; ab5103; Abcam), anti-transferrin (dilution 1:2000; ab82411; Abcam), anti-Histone H3 antibody (1:2000; total H3; ab1791; Abcam), anti-PAD4 (1:1000; ab214810; Abcam) and antiβ -actin (1:2000; AC-15; Sigma). The secondary antibodies used were anti-rabbit HRP (1:2000; P0260; DAKO, Denmark) or anti-mouse HRP (1:1000; P0447; DAKO, Denmark). Signals were detected using SuperSignal West Dura Extended Duration Substrate (ThermoFisher Scienti /uniFB01 c) and an ImageQuant LAS 4000 imager (GE Healthcare). Uncropped scans of western blots are provided in the Source Data /uniFB01 le.

Statistics . For animal experiments, mice between 8 and 12 weeks of age were randomly selected and analysed as biological replicates. For in vitro and ex vivo experiments, blood samples from different healthy donors were used as biological replicates. All analyses were performed unblinded, except for platelet counts and histology. Normality of the data was tested using the Shapiro -Wilk normality test. Nonparametric data with multiple comparisons were analysed by Kruskal -Wallis one-way analysis of variance followed by Holm s Stepdown Bonferroni procedure ' for adjusted p -values. The Mann -Whitney t test was used for comparison between two groups. Data with normal distribution were analysed by one-way ANOVA with Dunnett s post-test or Tukey s correction for multiple comparisons as ' ' described in the /uniFB01 gure legends. Statistical signi /uniFB01 cance was set at p &lt; 0.05. Data were analysed using Prism 7.0 software (GraphPad, La Jolla, CA).
