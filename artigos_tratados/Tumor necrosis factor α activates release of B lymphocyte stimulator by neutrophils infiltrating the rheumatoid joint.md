Objective. The tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family member B lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS) is an important regulator of B cell-dependent autoimmunity. Similar to other TNF family members, it is generally expressed as a transmembrane protein and cleaved from the surface to release its active soluble form. This study was undertaken to investigate the expression of BLyS and regulation of BLyS release from the surface of neutrophils infiltrating the rheumatoid joint.

Methods. BLyS expression was studied in neutrophils from the synovial fluid and peripheral blood of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and healthy controls, by flow cytometry, Western blotting, and immunofluorescence analyses. Peripheral blood neutro-

phils cultured with 50% RA synovial fluid were study for membrane expression of BLyS. Neutrophils were exposed to a range of proinflammatory cytokines to study the mechanisms of surface loss of BLyS.

Results. Expression of BLyS was detected on the surface of peripheral blood neutrophils from both RA patients and healthy controls, whereas BLyS expression on synovial fluid neutrophils was very low. Constitutive expression of BLyS was observed in neutrophils, both on the cell membrane and in intracellular stores; however, BLyS release from each of these sites was found to be regulated independently. Of the various cytokine stimuli, only TNF ùõÇ triggered release of BLyS from the neutrophil membrane. This process led to release of physiologically relevant quantities of soluble BLyS, which was dependent on the presence of the pro-protein convertase furin. In contrast, stimulation of neutrophils with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor induced BLyS release from the intracellular stores. Incubation of peripheral blood neutrophils with RA synovial fluid led to TNF ùõÇ -dependent shedding of BLyS from the cell surface.

Conclusion. These findings indicate that as neutrophils enter the site of inflammation, they release surface-expressed BLyS in a TNF ùõÇ -dependent manner, and thus may contribute to local stimulation of autoimmune B cell responses.

Neutrophils are abundant, short-lived effectors of the innate immune system. During a disease flare in a rheumatoid joint, large numbers of neutrophils invade the synovial fluid. Although their role is not completely understood, the release of proteases and reactive oxygen species by neutrophils is likely to contribute to joint damage (1). Neutrophils are known to release proinflammatory factors, including leukotriene B4 (LTB4),

interleukin-8 (IL-8), and IL-1 ùõÉ . Among these, LTB4 production by neutrophils is a prerequisite for the development of arthritis in the K/BxN serum transfer model of arthritis (2,3). In addition, the development of collagen-induced arthritis in DBA/1 mice depends on the presence of neutrophils in the rheumatoid joint (3,4). However, it is widely held that rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is not caused by the dysregulation of a single cell population, but is a multifactorial disease involving inappropriate actions and interactions between cells of the innate and the adaptive immune systems.

In this context, a recent study provided evidence that neutrophils can produce B lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS; trademark of Human Genome Sciences, Rockville, MD) (5), a B cell-stimulating cytokine. There is mounting evidence for a role of B cells in the complex interactions leading to the development of RA. While it has been known for some time that production of rheumatoid factor is closely associated with RA, it is now recognized that the combined presence of rheumatoid factor and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies has a very high specificity for the development of chronic RA in patients with very early synovitis (6,7). These findings suggest a key role for B cells in all stages of RA and indicate that factors involved in the activation or survival of autoimmune B cells may be of crucial importance for disease progression.

BLyS (also known as BAFF, TALL-1, THANK, or zTNF4 [8-12]) is a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily that regulates several aspects of B cell physiology, including proliferation, survival, and differentiation. It is therefore not surprising that BLyS has been proposed as an important regulator of B cell-dependent autoimmune diseases. The observation that BLyS-transgenic mice develop autoimmune disorders, and the fact that levels of BLyS in RA and other autoimmune disorders are elevated indicate that the expression of BLyS must be tightly regulated to maintain B cell survival without triggering autoimmunity (13-15).

When production of BLyS by dendritic cells was first described, it was suggested that BLyS, similar to other members of the TNF ùõÇ gene family, is expressed as a type II single transmembrane protein that forms biologically active trimers (9,10,12). To release the cytokine, it is cleaved from the cell surface. The main proteases responsible for the release of TNF ùõÇ are TACEand ADAM-17, although other proteases, such as proteinase 3, can also mediate TNF ùõÇ release (16). However, the release of BLyS from the cell surface appears to be regulated in a different manner.

The multibasic motif of the stalk region of BLyS

(R-N-K-R) resembles the target sequence for furin, a member of the pro-protein convertase family, prompting the notion that BLyS release is mediated by furin (17). Interestingly, while BLyS is produced as a membranebound pro-form in most myeloid cell types, recent studies have shown that it can also be expressed in a readily processed form in intracellular vesicles in granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)-primed neutrophils (5). The regulation of these distinct stores of BLyS in neutrophils and their potential role in autoimmune diseases such as RA or lupus have not been described.

In the present study, we investigated the expression of BLyS by neutrophils from the synovial fluid and the peripheral blood of patients with RA. Initial experiments showed a significantly lower expression of BLyS on the surface of synovial fluid neutrophils compared with peripheral blood neutrophils. Consequently, we investigated the mechanisms involved in the loss of BLyS from the surface of neutrophils. We exposed neutrophils to a range of proinflammatory cytokines. Intriguingly, we observed rapid release of surface-bound BLyS in cells exposed to TNF ùõÇ and slow release of BLyS from intracellular sources upon long-term exposure to G-CSF. These observations suggest that neutrophils have 2 distinct BLyS stores, an intracellular store that is sensitive to G-CSF, and a membrane-bound store that is released in the presence of TNF . Exposure of periùõÇ pheral blood neutrophils to synovial fluid from RA patients resulted in a rapid, TNF ùõÇ -dependent release of BLyS from the neutrophil surface. We conclude that there is a TNF ùõÇ -dependent mechanism leading to the rapid release of BLyS from the neutrophil surface during infiltration of neutrophils into the rheumatoid joint. This release may well contribute to the B cell autoimmunity observed in RA.

## PATIENTS AND METHODS

Patients. All study patients (n = 11) fulfilled the American College of Rheumatology (formerly, the American Rheumatism Association) 1987 revised criteria for RA (18). The median disease duration was 5 years (range 10 weeks to 31 years). Six patients were taking the following diseasemodifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs): hydroxychloroquine (n = 1), sulfasalazine (n = 1), methotrexate (n = 2), methotrexate plus sulfasalazine (n = 1), and gold (n = 1). Five patients were not taking DMARDs at the time of clinical presentation and entry into the study. The median age of the RA patients was 57 years (range 32-88 years). Nine of the 11 patients were female, and 10 were rheumatoid factor positive. All patients and healthy volunteer control subjects (n = 9) gave their written informed consent for participation in this

study, which was approved by the local research ethics committee.

Purification of neutrophils. Highly purified neutrophils were isolated by Percoll gradient separation as described previously (19). The neutrophils were resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium (Gibco BRL, Grand Island, NY) containing 10% fetal calf serum (Sera Lab International, Crowley Down, UK), penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 ùõç g/ml), and 2 m M L-glutamine (Sigma-Aldrich, Poole, UK) to a final cell density of 2 √ó 10 /ml. The purity of the neutrophil preparations was 6 checked by light microscopy, after staining neutrophil cytospins with a commercial May-Gru nwald Giemsa stain kit (Diff-Quik; Baxter Healthcare, Compton, UK). Purity of the neutrophil preparations was routinely &gt; 97%, with the major contaminant being eosinophils. Neutrophils from synovial fluid were isolated with a similar protocol, after pretreatment of the synovial fluid with 10 units/ml hyaluronidase for 20 minutes at 37¬∞C to reduce viscosity.

Purification of monocytes. Monocytes were isolated from the peripheral blood of normal healthy donors by magnetic-activated cell sorting using superparamagnetic microbeads (MACS beads) labeled with anti-CD14 antibody (Miltenyi, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany). Briefly, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from the blood of normal healthy donors, incubated with anti-CD14labeled beads, washed, and separated from the unlabeled cells in a magnetized column (Miltenyi) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

Cytokine stimulation of neutrophils. Neutrophils, at a density of 2 √ó 10 /ml, were treated with a range of cytokines 6 (BioSource Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) in varying concentrations as follows: G-CSF at 1,000 units/ml, granulocytemacrophage CSF (GM-CSF) at 100 ng/ml, TNF ùõÇ at 10 ng/ml, IL-6 at 250 ng/ml, IL-1 ùõÉ at 50 ng/ml, interferonùõÉ at 1,000 units/ml, and IL-8 at 200 ng/ml. For studies of the mechanism of surface release of BLyS, neutrophils were treated with TNF ùõÇ (10 ng/ml). The cells were cultured at 37¬∞C in a humidified incubator with an atmosphere of 5% CO2. In selected experiments, neutrophils were precultured for 30 minutes in the presence or absence of a range of protease inhibitors, including the furin convertase inhibitor chloromethylketone at 25 ùõç M (Calbiochem, Nottingham, UK), 4-(2aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride (AEBSF) at 2 m M (Sigma-Aldrich), the metalloprotease inhibitor GW280264X at 10 ùõç M (GlaxoSmithKline, Stevenage, UK), elafin at 70 n M , and both an elastase inhibitor and cathepsin G inhibitor, each at 200 n M (Calbiochem) (20).

Measurement of BLyS and TNF ùõÇ by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Expression of BLyS and TNF ùõÇ by neutrophils was determined using specific ELISAs. The commercial BLyS-specific ELISA (R&amp;D Systems, Abingdon, UK) and TNF -specific ùõÇ ELISA (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ) were carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions.

Flow cytometric analysis of BLyS, furin, and CD95 expression. Extracellular BLyS expression was analyzed on the surface of the neutrophils isolated from RA patients or control individuals. Neutrophils were resuspended with anti-BLyS monoclonal antibody (anti-BAFF; PeproTech, London, UK) or mouse IgG negative control (Dako, Ely, UK) for 1 hour on ice. All antibodies were prediluted in phosphate buffered

saline (PBS) containing 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA). All washing steps were performed in PBS containing 2% BSA. The primary antibody was detected with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG1 secondary antibody (Southern Biotechnology, Birmingham, AL). The same staining conditions were applied to monocytes, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed B cell lines, and cells of the promyelocytic cell line HL-60. Specificity of the anti-BLyS monoclonal antibody was validated by preincubating the antibody for 1 hour with recombinant human BLyS at a concentration of 10 ùõç g/ml.

Furin expression was determined by staining of control and TNF ùõÇ -treated neutrophils with a goat anti-human furin antibody (R&amp;D Systems) and detection with an FITC-labeled rabbit anti-goat secondary antibody (Southern Biotechnology). CD95 expression was detected using a murine monoclonal antibody (clone CH11; Upstate Bioscience, Charlottesville, VA) and detection with an FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgM antibody (Southern Biotechnology). All experiments were controlled using species-, isotype-, and concentration-matched irrelevant antibodies. Samples were read using a Coulter Epics XL Flow Cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA). Samples were subsequently analyzed using WinMDI software (Scripps Research Institute, San Diego, CA), with results expressed as the mean fluorescence intensity.

Exposure of blood neutrophils to RA synovial fluid. Neutrophils from healthy volunteers were cultured in the presence of 50% RA synovial fluid and 50% RPMI 1640 medium for 1 hour at 37¬∞C, with or without neutralizing antibodies against TNF ùõÇ (BioSource Invitrogen). As controls, neutrophils were stimulated with TNF ùõÇ in the presence of anti-TNF ùõÇ antibodies. The cultured cells were then assessed for membrane expression of BLyS in the same manner as described above.

Immunofluorescence analysis of intra- and extracellular expression of BLyS by neutrophils. Extracellular and intracellular BLyS expression was analyzed by immunofluorescence confocal analysis. To specifically detect the membranebound pool of BLyS, live neutrophils were stained with an anti-BLyS monoclonal antibody (PeproTech) or isotype control antibody (Dako), which was used at the same protein concentration as the anti-BLyS antibody, for 1 hour. This was followed by 2 wash steps using PBS for 5 minutes. Specific staining was detected using an FITC-labeled anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Southern Biotechnology). The cells were then fixed and permeabilized using the Caltag Fix and Perm Kit (BioSource Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

The permeabilized cells were stained with a mouse anti-BLyS monoclonal antibody and revealed with Texas Redconjugated goat anti-mouse IgG1. The stained cells were cytocentrifuged onto glass slides, using a Shandon II cytocentrifuge (Pittsburgh, PA), and allowed to air dry for a minimum of 3 hours. The nuclei were counterstained with 4 ,6-' diamidino-2-phenylindole, and the samples were mounted in AF-1 antifade medium and viewed using a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal scanning microscope equipped with a c-apochromat 63 √ó /1.2 water immersion objective (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Isotype- and concentration-matched control antibodies yielded consistently negative results. Images were analyzed using LSM 510 software (version 2.3; Carl Zeiss).

Detection of BLyS by Western blotting. Proteins from freshly isolated neutrophils were precipitated by 5 minutes' incubation with 10% (weight/volume) trichloroacetic acid (TCA). Briefly, the neutrophil pellet was precipitated with ice-cold 10% TCA, and the precipitated proteins were spun down at 14,000 g for 5 minutes at 4¬∞C. The precipitate was washed 3 times in ice-cold acetone and taken up in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDSPAGE) sample buffer. Proteins were separated on 12% SDSPAGE gels. The equivalent of 3 √ó 10 6 cells per lane was loaded onto standard SDS-PAGE gels and blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Western blots were blocked with 4% nonfat dry milk and developed with rat anti-BLyS antibody (Buffy-2; Axxora, Nottingham, UK). Blots were developed using an enhanced chemiluminescence method (Amersham Pharmacia, Buckinghamshire, UK).

Statistical analysis. The results presented are representative of a minimum of 3 experiments and, where appropriate, are expressed as the mean ¬± SD. Statistical significance was assessed by Student's 2-tailed t -test or, for experiments using clinical samples, by nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test. P values less than 0.05 were considered significant.

## RESULTS

Expression of BLyS by neutrophils from healthy donors. In dendritic cells and monocytes, BLyS is released from the cell surface by cleavage of the membrane-bound pro-form (12). Previous findings suggested that although neutrophils could produce and secrete BLyS, it could only be found in Golgi-associated intracellular compartments after priming for 20 hours with G-CSF (5,21). To clarify this unusual distribution of BLyS, neutrophils, monocytes, EBV-transformed B cells, and the promyelocytic cell line HL-60 were labeled with anti-BLyS antibody and analyzed by flow cytometry. HL-60 cells were used as positive controls, and an EBV-transformed B cell line was used as a negative control.

These experiments unequivocally showed expression of BLyS on the neutrophil surface (Figure 1A). To test whether this expression of BLyS was induced by the neutrophil purification protocol, we compared the level of BLyS expression on neutrophils stained in heparinized whole blood with that on neutrophils purified by Percoll gradient centrifugation. The results (not shown) indicated that the neutrophil isolation procedure did not affect the findings of neutrophil staining.

Intracellular stores of BLyS have been shown to be processed to a 17-kd form that does not contain the transmembrane region (5). Western blots of lysates from freshly isolated neutrophils probed with anti-BLyS antibody showed bands at 17 kd and 32 kd (Figure 1B). The 32-kd band was consistent with the presence of membrane-bound BLyS, and the 17-kd form was consis-

tent with the processed form stored in Golgi-related vesicles (5). As shown in Figure 1C, the specificity of BLyS staining was confirmed by the results of preincubation with anti-BLyS antibody and recombinant human BLyS.

To investigate the concomitant expression of membrane-bound BLyS and intracellular BLyS on neu-

trophils, the subcellular localization of BLyS was assayed by immunofluorescence staining and confocal microscopy. Externally accessible, membrane-bound BLyS was labeled by staining neutrophils with a mouse anti-BLyS antibody in suspension (visualized as green fluorescence in Figure 1D). Cells were then fixed, permeabilized, and colabeled with a mouse anti-BLyS antibody (visualized as red fluorescence in Figure 1D) to detect the release of BLyS both intracellularly and extracellularly.

The green surface staining of the neutrophils (Figure 1D) was consistent with our flow cytometric demonstration of BLyS on the cell surface. The distinct intracellular granular staining detected suggests that in addition to formation of a surface-bound pool of BLyS, neutrophils also express BLyS intracellularly. This detection of a preformed pool of intracellular BLyS is consistent with previous observations (5). However, expression of membrane-bound BLyS on neutrophils has not been described before, but is consistent with the localization that has been described for other myeloid cells. Our observations confirm that BLyS is expressed both on the surface and in intracellular stores of freshly isolated human neutrophils.

Expression of BLyS on peripheral blood and synovial fluid neutrophils. We compared the level of BLyS expression on neutrophils isolated from the peripheral blood and synovial fluid of patients with RA with the levels found on neutrophils isolated from the periph-

eral blood and synovial fluid of healthy controls. As shown in Figure 2, neutrophils from the synovial fluid expressed significantly lower levels of BLyS on their surface when compared with the expression on peripheral blood neutrophils, from either RA patients or healthy controls. Among the patients tested, we found no influence of disease duration or drug regimen on the expression of BLyS on the neutrophil surface. These findings led us to investigate how the microenvironment of inflammation activates shedding mechanisms to release biologically active BLyS from the surface of neutrophils and thus contribute to B cell autoimmunity.

Induction of release of the membrane-bound pool of BLyS by proinflammatory cytokines. Incubation of blood neutrophils with proinflammatory cytokines for 1 hour showed that treatment with TNF ùõÇ led to a dramatic decrease in BLyS expression on the neutrophil surface (Figures 3A and B). In the same experiments, the level of BLyS detectable in the supernatant was increased when neutrophils were incubated with TNF ùõÇ , suggesting that TNF ùõÇ may activate release of BLyS directly from the cell surface (Figure 3C). In addition, GM-CSF and IL-8 had a minor effect on BLyS release. Incubation of neutrophils with the same selection of cytokines for 18 hours showed that over a longer incubation period, both G-CSF and TNF ùõÇ induced release of BLyS into the supernatant (Figure 3E).

Interestingly, the release of BLyS induced by G-CSF was not associated with changes in the levels of BLyS expressed on the membrane (Figure 3D), implying that the G-CSF-induced BLyS release was from intracellular stores. In contrast, the release of BLyS induced by TNF ùõÇ was much more rapid and was accompanied by the loss of membrane-associated BLyS (Figure 3D), as seen after 1 hour and persisting for at least 18 hours.

Time-course experiments showed that TNF ùõÇ induced rapid release of BLyS from the cell surface (Figure 3F). Titration experiments revealed that release of BLyS was induced at physiologically relevant concentrations of TNF ùõÇ (Figure 3G). As shown in Figure 3H, CD95 staining of neutrophils was not affected by TNF ùõÇ treatment, suggesting that the TNF -induced ùõÇ loss of BLyS expression on neutrophils was specific for BLyS. The level of BLyS expression on monocytes was not affected by incubation with TNF ùõÇ ( Figure 3I), suggesting that the release of BLyS is a neutrophil-specific mechanism.

Thus, the observed expression of BLyS from intracellular stores following prolonged incubation with G-CSF is consistent with previous findings (5,21). In

Figure 3. Effects of stimulation with a range of proinflammatory cytokines on extracellular and intracellular release of B lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS) from neutrophils. BLyS expression was assessed on the surface of neutrophils after short-term (1-hour) incubation with cytokines, by flow cytometry analysis ( A ) and quantification of BLyS staining ( B ). Open areas in A indicate BLyS expression. The expression of BLyS was also quantified after short-term (1-hour) incubation with cytokines in the supernatant ( C ). Expression of BLyS on the surface of neutrophils (D) and in the supernatant (E) was further assessed in long-term (18-hour) cultures with cytokines. Tumor necrosis factor ùõÇ (TNF ùõÇ )-induced loss of membrane-expressed BLyS was assessed in time-course analyses (F) ; the maximum change in BLyS expression was observed within 30 minutes. For determination of maximal TNF ùõÇ -induced BLyS release, concentrations of TNF ùõÇ were tested in titration experiments, showing that BLyS release could be triggered by physiologically relevant concentrations of TNF ùõÇ (G) . CD95 expression by neutrophils (H) and BLyS expression by monocytes (I) after 1-hour incubation with TNF ùõÇ were also assessed. Results in B-G are the mean and SD of 3 separate experiments, expressed as the percent of mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of BLyS staining, with the MFI of BLyS staining of untreated neutrophils defined as 100%.

addition, in the present study, we were able to demonstrate constitutive expression of BLyS by neutrophils, and induction of the release of membrane-bound BLyS by TNF ùõÇ .

Characterization of the proteolytic activity mediating TNF ùõÇ -dependent BLyS release. TNF family members are, in most cases, released from the cell surface by proteolytic enzymes (20). These include metalloproteases, such as ADAM-17/TACE, as well as serine proteases, such as proteinase 3, cathepsin G, elastase, and furin (12,16). Inhibitors of both groups of proteases were used to explore the mechanism of TNF ùõÇ -induced BLyS release in neutrophils from the peripheral blood (Figure 4A).

The hydroxamate GW280264X can block TACE and other metalloproteases of the disintegrin family (22). However, there was no effect of this inhibitor on the release of BLyS (Figure 4A), which suggests that there is no role for this group of proteases in the expression of BLyS from neutrophils. Incubation with AEBSF, a general serine protease inhibitor, blocked BLyS release (Figure 4A). Given the efficient blockade of BLyS release by AEBSF, obvious candidates for the BLyS-releasing activity were the 3 major serine proteases (elastase, cathepsin G, and proteinase 3) (23,24) that are released to the neutrophil membrane after stimulation. Inhibitors of these proteases failed to inhibit BLyS release (Figure 4A).

Another serine protease, furin, has been implicated in the release of BLyS from dendritic cells (12). The members of this family of pro-protein convertases are calcium-dependent serine proteases that normally reside in the nearby Golgi complex. They can, however, also shuttle between the Golgi complex and the plasma membrane (25). Figures 4A and B show that a specific, cell-permeable furin convertase inhibitor (FCI) abrogated the TNF ùõÇ -induced BLyS loss from the neutrophil membrane as well as the TNF -induced ùõÇ increase in BLyS levels in the supernatant. Furthermore, TNF ùõÇ treatment led to an increased level of furin expression on the membrane of blood-derived neutrophils (Figures 4C and D).

RA synovial fluid-activated release of BLyS in a TNF ùõÇ -dependent manner. The results presented thus far suggest that TNF ùõÇ activates shedding of BLyS from the surface of neutrophils by a mechanism involving activation of furin convertase. Furthermore, neutrophils purified from RA synovial fluid express low levels of BLyS on their surface. Concentrations of TNF ùõÇ that have been reported to be present in RA synovial fluid range up to ‚àº 90 pg/ml (26). The results of our titration experiments suggested that TNF ùõÇ concentrations of ‚àº 10 pg/ml are sufficient to activate BLyS shedding, and that this level can be easily reached in the synovial fluid of RA patients. These calculations, however, do not take

Figure 5. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) synovial fluid (SF)-activated release of B lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS) in a tumor necrosis factor ùõÇ (TNF ùõÇ )-dependent manner. Neutrophils were purified from the blood of healthy donors, exposed to 50% SF from RA patients for 1 hour, and stained for BLyS expression. Compared with control cultures, cultures with SF showed a drop in BLyS expression on the surface of blood neutrophils. Neutralizing anti-TNF ùõÇ antibodies (SF + nAb) significantly reduced this effect. Neutralizing antibodies on their own (nAb) had no significant influence on BLyS expression. To test the efficiency of the neutralizing antibody, we cultured neutrophils with TNF ùõÇ alone, and blocked its effect with the neutralizing antibody (TNF ùõÇ + nAb). Results are the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of BLyS staining, with the MFI of BLyS staining of untreated neutrophils defined as 100%. Bars indicate the median. ‚àó = P &lt; 0.05.

into consideration that synovial fluid contains a multitude of other factors, such as other cytokines and soluble TNF receptors, that might counteract or amplify the effect of TNF ùõÇ on BLyS release.

We therefore incubated neutrophils isolated from the peripheral blood of healthy donors with the synovial fluid from RA patients. As shown in Figure 5, incubation with RA synovial fluid induced the loss of BLyS from the cell surface of neutrophils. Blocking of TNF ùõÇ using a neutralizing antibody significantly inhibited this effect. Based on these observations, we conclude that TNF ùõÇ in the synovial microenvironment activates the furin-induced cleavage of membranebound BLyS from neutrophils.

## DISCUSSION

BLyS is an important regulator of B cell autoimmunity. Significant levels of soluble BLyS are found in the serum and synovial fluid of patients with RA (15). In the present study, we have shown that neutrophils, which

are the dominant cell population in synovial fluid, constitutively express BLyS. We have identified TNF ùõÇ as a potent and effective microenvironmental factor that can rapidly activate the release of membrane-bound BLyS. Titration experiments showed that a significant loss of membrane-bound BLyS can be induced by TNF ùõÇ concentrations as low as 10 pg. This concentration is well in the range of concentrations determined by McNearney et al (26). As confirmation, synovial fluid from patients with RA was able to induce BLyS release in a TNF -dependent manner. The low ex vivo expression of ùõÇ BLyS detected on synovial neutrophils would therefore be consistent with a model in which neutrophils shed BLyS as they enter the rheumatoid joint and encounter TNF . ùõÇ

Recent developments in the treatment of RA patients with B cell-targeting drugs (27) show that the role of B cells in the pathophysiology of RA was previously underestimated. Ectopic sites of B cell differentiation and hypermutation have been identified in the rheumatoid synovium. In addition, we recently found that the very early phase of RA is associated with high levels of IL-4 and IL-13, cytokines that are mostly associated with B cell responses supported by Th2 cells (28). These observations suggest a key role of B cell stimulation in the very early stages of RA. Moreover, the factors involved in autoimmune B cell activation or survival may represent rational therapeutic targets that could halt progression of the disease.

BLyS is therefore an attractive therapeutic target, although initial findings from a phase II clinical trial in which blocking monoclonal antibodies against BLyS were used showed only modest clinical improvements (29). However, a recent study showed that in patients undergoing B cell depletion therapy with rituximab, the BLyS levels increased in direct relation to the drop in B cell numbers (30). It is likely that increased levels of BLyS contribute to the reemergence of B cells observed within months of B cell depletion therapy. This raises the possibility that combining anti-BLyS therapy with B cell depletion therapy may increase the duration of B cell depletion.

Thus far, dendritic cells, macrophages, and synoviocytes were considered to be the main sources of BLyS in the rheumatoid joint. Indeed, the results of a recent study suggested that macrophages are the major source of BLyS production in synovial tissue in the established phase of RA (31). However, that study did not consider cells within the synovial fluid or factors that might be involved in the early phases of the development of RA prior to the development of pannus hyperplasia. In this

context, Tan et al (32) showed that the concentration of BLyS in synovial fluid correlated positively with the absolute numbers of both monocytes and neutrophils. New data from our group and other investigators (5,21) have shown that neutrophils can produce significant quantities of BLyS and therefore have the potential to influence B cell activation.

The results of the present study show that BLyS is expressed both on the surface of neutrophils and in preprocessed intracellular pools. We investigated the regulation of BLyS release by proinflammatory cytokines and found that among a range of neutrophilstimulating cytokines, only TNF ùõÇ was able to trigger BLyS release from the neutrophil membrane. In contrast, G-CSF increased release of BLyS from intracellular stores without changing the membrane level of BLyS. We conclude from these studies that freshly isolated neutrophils from normal healthy donors constitutively express BLyS at 2 separate sites, and that release from these stores is affected by different proinflammatory cytokines.

The membrane-associated pool of BLyS can be rapidly released by stimulation of neutrophils with TNF . This release ùõÇ involves the translocation of the pro-protein convertase furin to the cell surface and subsequent shedding of BLyS. In contrast, the intracellular pool of BLyS is released from the cells by G-CSF treatment, which is in accord with previous findings (5,21), although in one of these studies, membranebound BLyS on neutrophils was not detected (5). It is likely that a difference in sensitivity of the staining methods used may account for these discrepancies. In the same study, the level of BLyS detected on the surface of HL-60 cells was very low, despite previous reports by other investigators of significant levels of BLyS on these cells (33).

BLyS is an essential component of B cell homeostasis, but its excess production results in multiple autoimmune symptoms. BLyS-transgenic mice have elevated serum immunoglobulin levels, including rheumatoid factor, as well as circulating immune complexes. BLyS-transgenic mice also show evidence of B cell hyperplasia (11,34,35). Of note, BLyS can potentially deviate the negative selection of B cells at the crucial T2 stage. These observations support a model of autoimmunity in these mice that is driven by excessive levels of BLyS, which generates a survival signal strong enough to overcome the death signals that are triggered by autoantigen binding to the B cell receptor (36).

The site of production of BLyS has been a topic of much debate. The concentration of BLyS in RA

synovial fluid has been reported to be higher than the serum concentration of BLyS, suggesting that production occurs at the site of inflammation (15). In this context, the recent findings by Collins et al (37) are of interest, in that they demonstrated that messenger RNA expression of BLyS in blood leukocytes of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) correlated better with disease severity than did the levels of BLyS in the blood. Those authors suggested that in SLE patients, but not in RA patients, blood leukocytes may be a major source of BLyS. Taken together, the evidence from the current literature suggests that depending on the underlying disease, increased production of BLyS can occur either systemically or locally at sites of inflammation. Our findings add to this body of evidence by showing that synovial fluid neutrophils are also a major source of BLyS.

The protease responsible for processing and shedding of BLyS in other myeloid cells has been proposed to be a furin-like convertase. However, in our experiments with neutrophils, it was important to rule out any role of other proteases known to be expressed on the surface of activated neutrophils (e.g., elastase, cathepsin G, and proteinase 3) (23,24). Specific inhibitors of elastase, cathepsin G, and proteinase 3 did not block the TNF -mediated release of BLyS from the neutrophil ùõÇ surface, whereas a furin inhibitor was effective.

A furin-mediated mechanism of BLyS release was first proposed by Schneider et al (12). Their logic was initially based on sequence data, which showed that the stalk region of BLyS contains the polybasic target site for cleavage by furin-like convertases. Elimination of this target site by mutation of amino acids 132 and 133 at this polybasic cleavage site yielded a form of BLyS that is not released by cleavage (33).

A role for furin in the shedding of a surfacebound molecule is potentially difficult to propose, since the main site of activity for this group of enzymes lies in the processing of pro-proteins in the trans-Golgi network (17). However, recent observations of furin translocation to the plasma membrane support the possible involvement of this enzyme in the shedding of a type II transmembrane protein from the cell surface (25,38). A previous indication of its ability to cleave proteins from the cell membrane came from studies showing that cell surface-bound furin is needed for the full activation of anthrax toxin protective antigen (39). A complex pathway characterized by the shuttling of furin between several subcellular compartments has since been unravelled (40,41). The mechanisms by which treatment of neutrophils with TNF ùõÇ leads to the translocation and

activation of furin are currently not understood and will require further investigation.

We conclude from these studies that the stimulatory effects of TNF ùõÇ lead to the release of BLyS from the surface of invading neutrophils at sites of inflammation. This release is mediated by activation of furin. In conditions involving massive influx of neutrophils into a limited space, such as the inflamed rheumatoid joint, BLyS released from neutrophils is likely to reach biologically significant levels and thus contribute to B cell autoimmunity.
