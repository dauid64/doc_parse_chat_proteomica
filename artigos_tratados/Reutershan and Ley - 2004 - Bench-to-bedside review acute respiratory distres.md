## Abstract

Acute lung injury and its more severe form, acute respiratory distress syndrome, are major challenges in critically ill patients. Activation of circulating neutrophils and transmigration into the alveolar airspace are associated with development of acute lung injury, and inhibitors of neutrophil recruitment attenuate lung damage in many experimental models. The molecular mechanisms of neutrophil recruitment in the lung  differ  fundamentally  from  those  in  other  tissues.  Distinct  signals  appear  to  regulate  neutrophil passage from the intravascular into the interstitial and alveolar compartments. Entry into the alveolar compartment  is  under  the  control  of  CXC  chemokine  receptor  (CXCR)2  and  its  ligands  (CXC chemokine ligand [CXCL]1-8). The mechanisms that govern neutrophil sequestration into the vascular compartment of the lung involve changes in the actin cytoskeleton and adhesion molecules, including selectins, β 2 integrins and intercellular adhesion molecule-1. The mechanisms of neutrophil entry into the lung interstitial  space  are  currently  unknown. This review summarizes mechanisms of neutrophil trafficking in the inflamed lung and their relevance to lung injury.

## Introduction

Acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are characterized by increased permeability of  the  alveolar-capillary  barrier,  resulting  in  influx  of  proteinrich edema  fluid  and  consequently  impairment  in  arterial oxygenation.  Although  mortality  has  decreased  over  recent decades,  it  remains  high  (30-40%),  and  pulmonary  and nonpulmonary morbidity in ARDS survivors is significant [1].

Although  ALI  has  been  described  in  neutropenic  patients, activation and transmigration of circulating neutrophils (polymorphonuclear leukocytes [PMNs]) are thought to play a major role in the early development of ALI [2]. In most animal

models, elimination of PMNs markedly decreases the severity of  ALI  [3].  In  addition,  recovery  from  neutropenia  in  some patients with lung injury is associated with a deterioration in pulmonary function [4].

Various  animal  models  have  been  developed  to  study  the molecular basis of PMN trafficking in the lung (Table 1), but each mimics only some aspects of the clinical situation. Preexisting pulmonary or nonpulmonary diseases, fluid resuscitation, and mechanical ventilation significantly influence  the  course  of  ALI  but  are  not  considered  in  most animal models. In addition, experimental methods with which to  study  PMN  recruitment  are  limited;  for  example,  intravital

microscopy  has produced  great insight into leukocyteendothelial interactions in many organs, but it is still technically challenging in the lung.

The specific architecture of the lung leads to unique properties of the  pulmonary  microcirculation.  Even  under  physiologic conditions,  neutrophils  must  stop  several  times  and  change their shape to traverse the small pulmonary capillaries (2-15 µ m [5]). This leads to an increased transit time through the pulmonary capillary bed and a significant 40- to 100-fold PMN accumulation ('marginated pool') in the lungs (Fig. 1) [6].

In the systemic microcirculation, PMN recruitment from blood into  tissue  at  sites  of  inflammation  usually  occurs  in  postcapillary venules and  requires capture, rolling, and  firm adhesion on activated endothelial cells. Selectin, integrin and immunoglobulin adhesion molecules, cytokines, chemokines, and  other  chemoattractants  participate  in  this  sequential process in a variety of vascular beds [7-9]. In contrast, the principal site of leukocyte migration in the lung is the capillary bed.  PMN  migration  into  the  different  lung  compartments (intravascular,  interstitial,  and  intra-alveolar)  is  differentially regulated because PMNs can enter the pulmonary interstitium without advancing to the alveolar airspace. However, crossing the epithelial barrier seems to be pivotal for inducing  lung  damage  and  it  is  associated  with  an increase in mortality [10]. Bacterial endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide [LPS]) is known to induce a large influx of PMNs into the alveolar airspace, but only when it is given intratracheally. In contrast, systemic  LPS  leads  to  PMN sequestration in the pulmonary vasculature, but most of these cells never appear in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid [11].

This  review  summarizes  experimental  findings  that  provide insight into the  mechanisms  of  PMN  recruitment  in  the pulmonary  microvasculature,  including  the  migration  steps from  blood  to  alveolar  airspace.  The  interrelation  between lung  inflammation  and  coagulation  provides  a  target  for potential future pharmacological interventions, and we critically discuss the clinical relevance of these experimental findings.

## Sequestration of neutrophils in the inflamed lung

In  contrast to physiologic margination, neutrophil sequestration  reflects  the  process  of  neutrophil  accumulation  in  the pulmonary vasculature in response to an inflammatory stimulus. Inflammatory challenge results in a rapid depression in circulating neutrophils  in  the  blood,  mainly  due  to  a dramatic  increase  in  PMN  sequestration  in  the  pulmonary microvasculature. Altered biomechanical properties of neutrophils  are  thought  to  be  important  for  PMN  sequestration  in the  lung  in  response  to  various  mediators  such  as  tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α , IL-8, platelet-activating factor, and N -formylmethionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) [12,13]. Activated neutrophils  lose  their  ability  to  deform  mainly  because  of intracellular  polymerization of actin filaments. Actin filaments are redistributed from the central, perinuclear regions to the peripheral regions in response to chemoattractants, forming actin  stress  fibers,  lamellipodia,  ruffles,  and  filopodia.  As  a result  of  these  changes  in  cell  shape  in  response  to  a chemoattractant, transit time through the pulmonary vasculature is prolonged, resulting in an increased concentration of PMNs  [14].  Inhibition of cellular actin organization with cytochalasin D  prevents fMLP-induced

Neutrophil trafficking in the lung. Neutrophils (polymorphonuclear leukocytes [PMNs], colored blue) enter a pulmonary capillary (left). Because of the small diameter of the capillary, neutrophils must deform, which increases transit time ('margination') even under resting conditions (inset A: margination). In venules, adhesion molecule (AM)-dependent rolling can occur. In response to an inflammatory stimulus (red arrow), neutrophils adhere to the capillary endothelium (inset B: sequestration). AMs and chemokines (not shown) might be involved in this process. Alveolar macrophages and type II pneumocytes produce CXC chemokines, which attract neutrophils to migrate through the endothelium (inset C1: transendothelial migration), interstitial space, and epithelium (inset C2: transepithelial migration) to reach the alveolar space. The requirement of AMs for the different steps is dependent on the stimulus and the used model (see text for details). Arrows indicate directions of flow, and dashed lines indicate endothelial and epithelial basement membrane.

PMN  sequestration  [15].  Circulating  neutrophils  in  ARDS patients were found to be less deformable [16], emphasizing the key role played by structural changes in PMN entrapment in the lung microvasculature.

The role of adhesion molecules in this process is not clear. L-selectin-deficient mice  exhibit attenuation of prolonged (5 min  after  complement  injection)  capillary  sequestration, whereas rapid PMN  accumulation is only reduced in noncapillary vessels [17]. L-selectin is required for the sequestration  of  neutrophils  in  the  lung  in  response  to  the formyl  peptide  fMLP,  but  not  C5a,  as  shown  by  blocking antibodies  and  L-selectin-deficient  mice  [18].  In  a  model  of sepsis-induced ARDS, antibodies to E-selectin and L-selectin did  not  affect  PMN  sequestration  [19].  Deficiency  in  either E-selectin  and  P-selectin  or  CD18  alone  did  not  affect sequestration  [20].  However,  blocking  CD18, α 4 , and α 5 integrin in combination resulted in a significant attenuation of fMLP-induced sequestration into the lung. Additional inhibition of E-selectin and L-selectin further attenuated PMN

sequestration, whereas inhibition of these selectins alone had no effect [21]. Interestingly, these blocking antibodies did not inhibit the physical deformation properties of PMNs, suggesting  that neutrophil deformability is not the only regulator of sequestration.

## Transendothelial migration of neutrophils

Transendothelial PMN migration in response to inflammatory stimuli  occurs  in  the  pulmonary  capillary  bed,  mainly  by penetrating interendothelial junctions or at bicellular or tricellular  corners  of  endothelial  cells,  although  there  is  an alternative, transcellular route [22]. Sequestered and adherent  neutrophils  induce  cytoskeletal  changes  in  the endothelial  cells.  Adhesive  interactions  between  leukocytes and endothelial cells, leading to intracellular signaling through transmembrane  proteins  in  the  area  of  tight  junctions  (e.g. platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule [PECAM]-1, CD99, VE-cadherin), might trigger transient remodeling of the junction [23,24]. It has  been  suggested  that  neutrophil proteases  may  digest  the  subendothelial  matrix.  However,

inhibition of these  proteases  does  not  affect  neutrophil transendothelial migration [25] or migration through  the basement membrane [26].

## Role of adhesion molecules

The  initial  steps  of  the  leukocyte  adhesion  cascade  include capture and rolling of circulating leukocytes and require E-, Land P-selectin [27], whereas integrins -heterodimeric transmembrane  glycoproteins  -  mediate  firm  adhesion  by interacting with intercellular adhesion molecules (e.g. intercellular adhesion molecule [ICAM]-1, ICAM-2, vascular cell adhesion molecule [VCAM]-1) [28]. Selectins and β 2 integrins (CD18) are the most studied adhesion molecules in ALI.

## Integrins

PMN migration in the lung can occur in both CD18-dependent and CD18-independent pathways, depending on the stimulus (Table 2). Neutrophil recruitment requires CD18 when induced by Escherichia coli , Pseudomonas aeruginosa ,  IL-1, or IgG immune complexes, whereas migration in response to Gram-positive  bacteria,  hyperoxia,  and  complement  factor C5a  is  CD18  independent.  Aspiration  of  hydrochloric  acid induces  a  CD18-independent  PMN  migration  at  the  site  of instillation but CD18-dependent  PMN  recruitment  in  the contralateral lung [29]. The way of application also influences the CD18  dependency of PMN  migration. Intratracheal instillation of LPS leads to a CD18 dependent recruitment into the alveolar airspace [30]. However, the same endotoxin given intraperitoneally [20] results in a neutrophil sequestration that

is  independent of CD18 and attenuates PMN recruitment in response to intratracheal LPS [31].

Most  stimuli  inducing  a  CD18-dependent  PMN  migration upregulate  ICAM-1  -  a  major  ligand  for  CD18  -  on  endothelial  cells.  Endothelial  ICAM-1  expression  was  increased following E.  coli LPS,  but  not Streptococcus  pneumoniae challenge [32]. The fact that IL-1 and TNFα ,  both of which are  nuclear  factorκ B-dependent  proinflammatory  cytokines that regulate expression of ICAM-1, are required for CD18/ICAM-1-dependent pathways supports this hypothesis. In addition, members of the β 1 integrin family (very late antigen-4  and  -5)  may  mediate  CD18-independent  PMN migration [22].

The CD18 integrin Mac-1 (CD11b/CD18) appears to be very important in PMN recruitment in the lung because antibodies to Mac-1, but not to lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1, CD11a/CD18), inhibited neutrophil migration significantly in an inhaled LPS  model [33]. Neutrophil inhibiting  factor,  a  hookworm-derived  protein  that  binds  to and blocks CD11b, also prevents PMN recruitment into the lung [34].

PECAM-1,  a  member  of  the  immunoglobulin  superfamily, localizes close to interendothelial clefts and has been suggested  to  regulate  PMN  migration  in  the  pulmonary vasculature.  In  an  early  study  [35],  antibodies  to  PECAM-1 attenuated neutrophil emigration into the lung in response to IgG immune complex deposition. However, PECAM-1 expression  does  not  change  in  response  to  inflammatory changes [36,37], and in a more recent study [38] blocking PECAM-1 did not prevent E. coli or S. pneumoniae induced lung injury in rats or mice.

## Selectins

Although  selectins are essential for initiating the rolling process  in  the  systemic  vasculature,  their  role  for  PMN transmigration in the pulmonary microcirculation is less clear and  depends  on  the  inflammatory  stimulus.  LPS-induced migration  into  the  alveolar  airspace  was  not  inhibited  by blocking  all  three  selectins  [39].  Neutrophil  emigration  is unaffected  by Streptococcus  pneumoniae in  mice  lacking E-selectin  and  P-selectin  with  L-selectin  function  blocked [40]. In contrast, all selectins have been shown to participate in the development of lung injury induced by complement or intratracheal  deposition  of  IgG  complexes  [41]  or  bacterial LPS [42], suggesting that the involvement of selectins may be  stimulus-dependent.  L-selectin  function  is  necessary  for sustained  intracapillary  accumulation  of  neutrophils,  but  not for emigration of neutrophils [43].

The impact of adhesion molecule mediated leukocyteendothelium  interaction  in  patients  with  ALI  is  yet  to  be elucidated. In lung tissue samples from patients who had died from ARDS, a strong upregulation of ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and

E-selectin was found, suggesting that these adhesion molecules play a role in human lung injury [36]. In an ex vivo study [44], human PMNs were found to express higher levels of CD18 after incubation with BAL fluid from ARDS patients who received a conventional as opposed to a lung protective ventilation  strategy.  It  was  suggest  that  this,  in  addition  to lower mechanical stress, could explain the beneficial effect of mechanical ventilation using low tidal volumes [45].

## Chemokines

Chemokines are a group of approximately 40 small chemoattractant  proteins  (70-125  amino  acids;  6-14 kDa) that  bind  to  G-protein  coupled  receptors  [46].  In  humans, CXC  chemokine  ligand  (CXCL)1-CXCL3  and  CXCL5CXCL8  bind  to  CXC  chemokine  receptor  (CXCR)1  and CXCR2, and are potent chemotactic factors for neutrophils. In  mice,  CXCL1-3,  CXCL5  and  CXCL6  bind  to  CXCR2. CXCL1  and  CXCL2  have  been  shown  to  induce  rapid integrin activation, causing arrest from rolling and chemotaxis [47]. Chemotaxis to chemokines or other soluble chemoattractants  such  as  C5a,  platelet-activating factor, leukotriene B , or fMLP might be the most important trigger 4 for PMN recruitment into the lung.

Chemokines are produced by activated macrophages, monocytes,  neutrophils,  endothelium,  epithelium,  platelets, and various parenchymal cells [48]. After having been secreted,  some  chemokines  are  immobilized  by  specific glycosaminoglycans  (GAGs)  on  target  cells.  GAG-bound chemokines may be able to activate neutrophils, or they must first  dissociate  from  GAGs  to  interact  with  their  receptors [49]. Neutrophils stimulated by chemokines  generate a (chemokine  receptor-rich)  pseudopod  at  the  leading  edge and  a  tail-like  uropod,  allowing  for  a  directional  movement toward the chemokine gradient [50]. Actin polymerization and depolymerization required for this cell remodeling are regulated  by  Rho,  Rac,  and  Cdc42  proteins,  which  are members  of  the Rho  family of small G  proteins [51]. Chemokines are able to activate these small G proteins and thereby  induce  locomotion  (Rac),  unidirectional  movement (Cdc42), and uropod retraction (Rho) [49]. Lack of Rac2, the predominant  Rac  isoform  in  human  neutrophils,  results  in  a severe immunodeficiency with impaired neutrophil polarization and chemotaxis [52].

The best studied CXC chemokine in humans is CXCL8 (IL-8), which has significant relevance to lung injury. High concentrations of IL-8 in BAL fluid from ARDS patients are associated with increased neutrophil influx into the airspace, and in vitro chemotactic activity of BAL  fluid can be attenuated by removing IL-8 [53]. Intratracheal instillation of IL-8 leads to a PMN influx in models of ALI, and blocking IL-8 has been shown to ameliorate lung damage in models of acid aspiration [54], pancreatitis [55], and reperfusion injury [56]. Recent  studies  suggest  that  IL-8  in  BAL  fluid  from  ARDS patients is  bound to an anti-IL-8 autoantibody. This immune

complex  exhibits  chemotactic  and  proinflammatory  activity [57] and its concentration might be an important prognostic factor for the development and outcome of ARDS [58,59].

In  rodents,  the  two  most  important  chemokines  for  PMN recruitment into the lung are keratinocyte-derived chemokine (KC)  and  macrophage  inflammatory  protein  (MIP)-2  [46]. Both bind to and activate CXCR2, but differ in their biological potency and affect PMN migration into the lung in different ways [60]. Only KC is selectively transported from the lung to the blood, whereas MIP-2 is retained in the lung compartment [61]. Circulating KC may be able to 'prime' circulating PMNs to  migrate  into  the  lung  in  response  to  MIP-2.  After  an intraperitoneal LPS challenge in mice, mRNA for both KC and MIP-2 is increased in lung tissue [62]. MIP-2 and CINC (the rat orthologue of KC) are upregulated in a hindlimb ischemia/reperfusion-induced lung injury model [63]. Neutralization  of  either  chemokine  significantly  decreases neutrophil recruitment into the lung [64]. Similarly, absence or blockade of CXCR2 attenuates neutrophil influx into the lung [65].  In  a  murine  model  of  ventilator-induced  lung  injury, mechanical  ventilation  with  high  peak  pressures  resulted  in an increase in both KC and MIP-2, and their level correlated with lung injury and neutrophil sequestration [66].

These chemokines may be released by alveolar macrophages,  alveolar  type  II  cells,  and  endothelial  cells [20,67,68].  After  an  intratracheal  LPS  challenge,  both  KC and MIP-2 are found in the alveolar airspace. KC  is synthesized, secreted, and deposited on syndecan-1 (a cellbound proteoglycan) molecules. Matrilysin, a matrix metalloproteinase, cleaves this KC-syndecan-1 complex and thereby may create a chemotactic gradient. Matrilysindeficient  mice  lack  the  ability  to  create  such  a  chemotactic gradient, and transepithelial efflux of neutrophils is attenuated [10]. In the setting of ALI, the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway appears to play a major role. P38 has been shown to stimulate the nuclear factorκ B mediated production  of  various  cytokines,  such  as  IL-1 β and  TNFα , and  to  affect  chemotaxis,  adhesion  and  oxygen  release, particularly in neutrophils [2]. P38 is activated in neutrophils after  endotoxin  exposure,  and  inhibition  of  p38  attenuates intratracheal LPS-induced neutrophil migration into the airspace without affecting the PMN accumulation in the lung and,  even  more  interesting,  without  affecting  the  alveolar expression of chemokines KC and MIP-2 [69].

Although KC and MIP-2 are the most studied chemokines in rodent  models  of  ALI,  other  CXC  chemokines  might  be involved. Epithelial neutrophil-activating peptide  (ENA)-78 (CXCL5)  has  been  measured  in  the  airspace  of  ARDS patients  and  correlated  with  neutrophil  counts  in  BAL  fluid [70], although the chemotactic potency appeared to be less when compared with IL-8 [71]. Increased ENA-78 expression was also found in a model of lung injury in rats induced by hepatic  ischemia/reperfusion  [72].  In  contrast,  LPS-induced

CXC  chemokine  (LIX;  the  murine  orthologue  of  ENA-78) expression  in  the  lung  was  not  affected  in  a  model  of abdominal sepsis [73].

Lungkine (CXCL15) is exclusively expressed in lung epithelial cells and is upregulated in various lung inflammation models. In a Klebsiella pneumoniae infection model, lungkinedeficient  mice  exhibited  reduced  PMN  migration  into  the alveolar space, whereas recruitment from the blood into the lung  parenchyma  appeared  to  be  unaffected,  suggesting  a role  for  this  chemokine  in  migration  through  the  alveolar epithelium [74].

## Neutrophil recruitment: crosstalk between inflammation and coagulation

More than 80 years ago, the deposition of fibrin strands in the inflamed lung tissue was suggested to be responsible for the emigration  of  neutrophils  into  the  alveolar  airspace  [75]. Using modern  methods, these observations have been confirmed [22]. There is clear evidence that fibrin deposition and microvascular thrombosis are early events in the development of ALI/ARDS, although the mechanisms remain unclear. Several attempts were made  to regulate the crosstalk between coagulation and inflammation in clinical trials. Although  not  focused  on  the  treatment  of  ARDS,  human recombinant protein C has been shown to increase survival in patients with severe sepsis [76].

Because of its central role in triggering blood coagulation with extensive consequences for both fibrin formation and inflammatory  response,  the  modulation  of  tissue  factor  (TF)dependent pathways has gained interest in animal and human studies.  TF  is  the  cellular  transmembrane  receptor  for  factor VIIa.  It  is  expressed  by  circulating  monocytes  and,  at  least under inflammatory conditions, by endothelial cells. In the lung, TF is expressed by alveolar macrophages  and alveolar epithelial  cells  [77].  During  inflammation,  TF  expression  and activity are increased in lung, brain, and kidney [78]. Beyond its  importance for hemostasis and thrombosis, TF has direct and  indirect  effects  on  the  inflammatory  system,  mainly  via production of thrombin, which activates proteinase activated receptor-1 to -4 and cleaves fibrinogen [79]. Activated by the binding  of  factor  VIIa,  TF  induces  the  expression  of  several proinflammatory genes (e.g. IL-1 β , IL-6, IL-8) [80] that may be involved  in  the  development  of  ARDS  [81].  TF  levels  in patients  with  ARDS  are  correlated  with  lung  injury  score, suggesting that blocking TF-dependent inflammation might be promising for the development of new therapeutic strategies.

TF  pathway  inhibitor  (TFPI)-1  is  an  endogenous  inhibitor  of the TF-factor VIIa complex. However, its physiological role in controlling excessive TF-induced coagulation and inflammation  in  the  clinical  setting  of  sepsis  and  lung  injury might  be  limited  [82].  Although  treatment  with  recombinant TFPI-1 in animal models of lung injury was promising, it failed to improve survival of patients with severe sepsis in a phase

III  clinical trial [83]. TFPI-1 does not affect the internalization of factor  VIIa, which  is  pivotal  for  further  TF-dependent signaling [84], and requires factor Xa for the formation of the inhibitory quaternary complex [85]. Therefore, TFPI-1 strategies  might  be  less  effective  than  blocking  TF  and/or factor VIIa directly. Blocking TF might interrupt a selfamplifying loop in which further signaling promotes inflammation [86]. Experimental findings showed that inhibition of the TF-factor VIIa complex increased survival in endotoxin-induced sepsis and ALI [87,88], even in a state of established sepsis [89].

## Conclusion

Patients  with  ALI  still  have  a  poor  prognosis  in  terms  of survival  and  long-term  morbidity.  The  decrease  in  ARDSrelated mortality is mainly based on improvement in supportive therapies such as protective ventilatory strategies [45].  Other  supportive  approaches  such  as  restrictive  fluid management are currently being investigated. Despite great effort, our understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms  of  ALI  and  ARDS  were  recently  found  to  be 'embryonic at best' [90].

The excessive activation and migration of circulating neutrophils from blood to the alveolar airspace is one of the key events in the early development of ALI. Blocking Mac-1, ICAM-1,  or  combinations  of  adhesion  molecules  has  been shown  to  protect  against  lung  injury  in  many  experimental studies. In animal models, reliable methodologic approaches to  assess  PMN  recruitment  in  the  lung  can  elucidate  the different mechanisms of PMN trafficking in the intravascular, interstitial,  and  alveolar  compartments.  However, the clinical relevance  of these  animal  models  remains  unclear,  and translation  into  clinical  studies  is  difficult.  These  limitations include  the  absence  of  comorbidity,  mechanical  ventilation, fluid  management,  antibiotic  treatment,  nutrition,  and  other factors  that  may  have  an  impact  on  outcome  in  humans.  In addition,  classical  ARDS  criteria  are  usually  not  tested  in animal  models.  Therefore,  clinical  studies  are  required  to obtain definitive answers [90].

Finally,  neutrophil  recruitment  into  the  lung  is  essential  for host  defense  against  bacterial  infections  [91,92].  The  dual role  of  neutrophils  in  the  lung  -  defending  against  infection and mediating lung injury - is not well understood, but must be considered in evaluation of therapeutic approaches.
