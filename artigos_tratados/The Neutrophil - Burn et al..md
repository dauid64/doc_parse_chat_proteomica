## SUMMARY

Neutrophils are immune cells with unusual biological features that furnish potent antimicrobial properties. These cells phagocytose and subsequently kill prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms very efficiently. Importantly, it is not only their ability to attack microbes within a constrained intracellular compartment that endows neutrophils with antimicrobial function. They can unleash their effectors into the extracellular space, where, even post-mortem, their killing machinery can endure and remain functional. The antimicrobial activity of neutrophils must not be misconstrued as being microbe specific and should be viewed more generally as biotoxic. Outside of fighting infections, neutrophils can harness their noxious machinery in other contexts, like cancer. Inappropriate or dysregulated neutrophil activation damages the host and contributes to autoimmune and inflammatory disease. Here we review a number of topics related to neutrophil biology based on contemporary findings.

## INTRODUCTION

Neutrophils are effective antimicrobial cells. This antimicrobial activity can be biotoxic, often resulting in pathological damage to host tissue and self-imposed disease when unchecked (Castanheira and Kubes, 2019; Soehnlein et al., 2017). Neutrophils far outnumber any other immune cell found in human blood and extravasate en masse into compromised tissue. Their abundance is clinically relevant because congenital defects or acquired conditions that lower neutrophil blood counts predict subsequent overwhelming infections (Newburger, 2016; Skokowa et al., 2017), revealing that tonic regulation of microbes by neutrophils is required for host integrity. Various elements from the neutrophil's arsenal are sometimes expressed by other cells. The difference, however, is their unique subcellular localization, sheer abundance and deployment mechanisms, which form the cornerstone of all neutrophil effector functions studied to date.

Uponsepticoraseptic pathology, the amplitude and duration of neutrophil activation influences the outcome at the injury focus. Furthermore, increasing evidence suggests that neutrophils are responsible for pathological manifestations within healthy tissues distal to the injury. Activated neutrophils in the bloodstream may be lethal (for example, during indirect respiratory distress; Yang et al., 2020b), and neutrophil behavior in the blood can predict sepsis (Ellett et al., 2018). The ability of neutrophils to damage thehostcontributestoadiversenumberofinflammatoryandautoimmunediseases,thegeneticbasisofwhichisbeginningtobeunderstood (Dinauer, 2016). In cancer, neutrophils can be pro- and anti-tumor and influence metastasis (Shaul and Fridlender, 2019). The abundance, purported heterogeneity, and expression profile of neutrophils can protect, harm, and heal the host.

Mature adult neutrophils do not divide, contain lobulated nuclei, are short lived (12-24 h), and are constantly replenished by the bonemarrow(Lawrenceetal., 2018). The bone marrow niche pro-

vides growth factors that engage progenitor cells to start neutrophil-specific transcriptional programs (Yvan-Charvet and Ng, 2019). One hallmark of neutrophil differentiation is choreographed switching on and off of genes encoding effector proteins that are trafficked into membrane-bound vesicles called granules (Cowland and Borregaard, 2016). Granules can be categorized according to protein content, which closely reflects temporal gene expression patterns during differentiation. Granules contain high concentrations of densely packed protein, are abundant, and participate in all known neutrophil antimicrobial effector functions. The oxidative capacity of a mature neutrophil is substantial and attributed to high expression of a plasma- and granule multi-subunit membrane-bound enzyme called nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)oxidase,whichisregulatedvia its assembly to produce superoxide (Winterbourn et al., 2016). Superoxide is extremely reactive and modifies different types of molecules, including nucleic acids, lipids, and proteins, and, hence, has antimicrobial activity. Genetic evidence in humans who lack NADPH oxidase activity and who suffer from chronic granulomatosedisease(CGD)phenotypicallycorrelatewithhigher infection rates. Neutrophils fromthese individuals are defective but can be corrected by gene therapy (Bianchi et al., 2009). Other changesduringdifferentiationincludeexpressionofspecificadhesion, chemokine, pattern recognition, cytokine, as well as many other receptors (van Rees et al., 2016).

Neutrophils also express enzymes that potently synthesize bioactive lipids derived from fatty acids (Serhan et al., 2014). Key pro-inflammatory lipid mediator families, such as leukotrienes and prostaglandins, have been discovered and characterized using neutrophils and their exudates where these mediators enhance neutrophil chemoattraction, cytokine production, and phagocytosis (Serhan, 2014). Neutrophils also possess the remarkablecapacitytogeneratelipidscollectivelytermedspecialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) that resolve neutrophilic

Although classically viewed as primitive effector cells, neutrophils and their products (cytokines, reactive oxygen species [ROS], and neutrophil extracellular traps [NETs]) modulate the innate and adaptive arms of the immune response. Neutrophils and NETs promote cytokine production by macrophages while enhancing DC recruitment and antigen presentation. In addition, neutrophils promote innate immune resolution and repair by regulating cytokine and growth factor production. Neutrophils trigger B cell expansion and antibody production. Neutrophils and neutrophil-derived cytokines also affect T cell cytokine production and differentiation while in some instances, perturbing T cell functionality.

inflammation. Key SPM families produced by neutrophils include resolvins, maresins,protectins, and lipoxins, which disrupt neutrophil chemotaxis and phagocytosis and even instruct neutrophil efferocytosis via instructions to local macrophages (Serhan, 2014; Serhan and Levy, 2018). Thus, neutrophils possess the remarkable capacity to synthesize lipids to regulate their activity and also to resolve inflammation.

Neutrophils exit the bone marrow having pre-synthesized their munitions and require little transcriptional or translational input when exacting their effector mechanisms (Ericson et al., 2014). Understanding neutrophils from a military perspective is relevant here; neutrophils are soldiers in the field. And like deployed soldiers, neutrophils enter any situation armed and ready for combat, even in the apparent absence of an enemy.

Neutrophils deploy at least three effector mechanisms: phagocytosis, degranulation, and formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). These mechanisms involve oxidative and nonoxidative pathways that drive effector function and exert biotoxicity (Segal, 2005; Winterbourn et al., 2016). Phagocytosis is the physical uptake of a microbe by neutrophils forming a pinched off intracellular cytoplasmic plasma membrane-bound compartment called a phagosome (Nordenfelt and Tapper, 2011). Phagosomes are a physically walled off vesicle in which the neutrophil can focus antimicrobial activity while limiting collateral cell damage. Granules fuse with the phagosomal membrane, delivering

soluble or membrane-embedded effector proteins onto or in close proximity to the compartmentalized microbe. The NADPH oxidase complex is embedded within the phagosome membrane-granule bilayer and produces intraphagosomal superoxide, which fuels the heme-bound enzyme myeloperoxidase to generate injurious chemicals like hypochlorite, more commonly known as bleach (Klebanoff et al., 2013; Ulfig and Leichert, 2021; Valenta et al., 2020). The ability of neutrophils to kill phagocytosed microbes is at least 1-2 orders of magnitude higher than that of any other professional phagocyte (Kaufmann, 1993; Levy, 2004; Segal, 2005). Unlike other phagocytes, neutrophils are rarely used as a niche by microbes following their engulfment. Phagocytosis has been demonstrated in vivo and in vitro (Rosowski, 2020). In principal, neutrophil degranulation has similarities to granule-phagosomal membrane fusion, but it occurs at the plasma membrane (Lacy, 2006). Thus, granule-derived soluble proteins are released into the extracellular space. In vitro evidence clearly demonstrates granules fusing with the plasma membrane, release of cargo protein, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Reporter substrates that fluoresce upon conversion by granule-derived enzymes in vivo provide only indirect evidence of this process. Thus, direct demonstration of degranulation in vivo remains a challenge. Finally, neutrophils produce NETs by decondensing their chromatin, decorating it with cytoplasmic or granule effector proteins, and then extruding it from the cell (Burgener and Schroder, 2020). The resulting protein-DNA scaffold has pleiotropic effects. Originally reported as an antimicrobial strategy that captures and kills bacteria, increasing evidence suggests that NETs have other functions in autoimmunity, coagulation, and cancer. NETs have been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo (Papayannopoulos, 2018).

Neutrophils are the direct immune effector cells of the antimicrobial response. A better appreciation of how neutrophils regulate homeostasis beyond infections is surfacing. Here we present a topical, contemporary review of some aspects of neutrophil biology (Figure 1), but we do not delve into autoimmunity or other chronic diseases, like atherosclerosis, because these have been reviewed recently and expertly (Silvestre-Roig et al., 2020; Wigerblad and Kaplan, 2020).

## Neutrophil adhesion and migration

Upon septic or aseptic injury, neutrophils exit the bloodstream and navigate the surrounding tissue, where they home to the exact site of the insult (Mo ' csai et al., 2015; Vestweber et al., 2014). To do this, neutrophils coordinate cellular movement using adhesion receptors and force generation by the cytoskeleton (Svitkina, 2018). Biomolecules that emanate from the injury site are intercepted by transmembrane receptors on the neutrophil cell surface, providing a dynamic set of molecular coordinates that facilitate homing (Hensley-McBain et al., 2019; Michael and Vermeren, 2019). Extracellular matrix-degrading proteins expressed by the neutrophil are utilized to gain entry to an injured site (Wolf and Friedl, 2011). Although immune cell migration has classically been framed as a purely mechanical process, the behaviors of all immune cells are influenced by the migration and adhesion events leading up to and during encounter of a threat (Mo ' csai et al., 2015). The different environments neutrophils physically pass through likely require a variety of mechanisms tailored for efficient passage to the site of injury.

Review

Neutrophils express different families of adhesion molecules, such as integrins and selectins, that bind their counter-ligand expressed on other cells or in the extracellular matrix, forming transient or stable adhesions. In parallel, these transmembrane adhesion molecules are engaged by cytoskeletal elements such as actin or other filament-forming proteins via adaptor proteins, culminating in foci where the cell cytoplasm is mechanically connected to the cell membrane and extracellular milieu (Michael and Parsons, 2020). Morphologically, neutrophils polarize when undergoing locomotion, with site-specific engagement of the substratum by tunable adhesion molecules with specific affinities, allowing formation of a clutch (Ley et al., 2018). The treadmilling and protrusive forces of actin itself push the cell membrane forward directionally, generating energies against the membrane as a function of actin filament of around 1 piconewton (Footer et al., 2007). The collective forces and dynamics of hundreds of millions of dynamic filaments arranging and rearranging puts neutrophils among the fastestmoving cells in the body (Hoang et al., 2013). The protrusive force generated by the cytoskeleton, coupled with the ability of the cell to grip and subsequently let go of its surrounding environment, is one form of migration. Using the cytoskeleton as a motor to generate force, neutrophils might not only migrate by gripping and pulling but also by pushing and squeezing, which does not require adhesion receptors (Bergert et al., 2012). In addition, immune cells may treadmill their plasma membrane heterogeneously, facilitating a third and unexpected ''swimming'' mode of migration (Aoun et al., 2020).

The adhesion cascade that allows neutrophils to extravasate is divided into four sequential but overlapping steps (Ley et al., 2007). The first step is slow and fast rolling on the endothelium and is mediated by selectins and integrins. Chemokines, on the surface of the endothelium, are sampled by rolling neutrophils, which signals changes in integrin conformation that allow high-affinity interactions with its counter-ligand, facilitating cellular arrest under conditions of blood flow (Margraf et al., 2020). It has been shown recently that the adhesion cascade does not always depend solely on expression of integrins and selectins because, in the liver and lungs, an atypical adhesion receptor, dipeptidase-1, mediates adhesion and recruitment of neutrophils (Choudhury et al., 2019). Thus, adhesion molecule dependency may be influenced by tissue-specific protein expression profiles of the vascular bed. The neutrophil then crawls and surveys the endothelium by cycling of high-affinity integrin-ligand interactions. Finally, neutrophils migrate between or through endothelial cells (para- versus transcellular migration), where they encounter pericytes and the basement membranes of the vasculature, which must be breached to reach the underlying tissue (Rudziak et al., 2019).

The endothelium itself is not passive during this process and can be regulated via signaling molecules like vascular endothelium protein tyrosine phosphatase, which, in turn, regulates the integrity of endothelial cell junctions and the subsequent ability of cells to exit the vasculature (Drexler et al., 2019). Moreover, recent work has demonstrated that local endothelial cell calcium fluxes triggered by migrating cells are important for transmigration because blocking calcium signaling in the endothelium severely disrupts transendothelial migration (Dalal et al., 2021). Lipid mediators, in addition to chemokines and cytokines, sus-

tain neutrophil polarization and adhesion via a LTB4-BLT1 axis, forming another important arm of regulation during extravasation (Saha et al., 2017; Subramanian et al., 2020). When in the tissue, neutrophils use chemo- and haptotaxis to home into the location where they are recruited to and then deploy effector functions, die, and are largely believed to be cleared by macrophages (Zarbock and Ley, 2008).

However, it has become clear in recent years that neutrophils do not only exit the vasculature, but they can re-enter the vasculature after surveying tissue in a process called ''reverse migration'' (Mathias et al., 2006; McDonald et al., 2010; Woodfin et al., 2011). Importantly, even neutrophils that perform an effector function, like phagocytosis, can re-enter the bloodstream, indicating that effector function does not preclude reverse migration. In contrast to transmigration out of the vasculature, the molecular determinants required for reverse migration remain mostly undefined, although specific proteases, like cathepsin C, might be important (Wang et al., 2017). Another interesting observation is ''hesitant migration,'' where neutrophils begin to extravasate but then de-adhere from the endothelium (Owen-Woods et al., 2020; Woodfin et al., 2011). It appears as though neutrophils that have undergone hesitant or reverse migration can be activated and may contribute to inflammatory pathology at sites distal to the original injury. The fate of reverse-transmigrated neutrophils requires further evaluation to deduce whether this process might influence host homeostasis in septic and aseptic injury.

As opposed to the endothelial bed, where cells grip the substratum of the lumen and must withstand very high sheer forces, tissues are a more static environment where migration must take place. Adhesion receptors like integrins are minimally required for motility in tissue but nevertheless may be utilized in other contexts, as discussed below (Kienle and Lammermann, 2016). € When inside the tissue, neutrophils migrate toward the site of injury using G protein-coupled receptors that detect endogenously (chemokines, cytokines, and damage associated molecular patterns) or exogenously derived (microbial associated molecular patterns) motifs (Kolaczkowska and Kubes, 2013). Chemokines can be tethered to the extracellular matrix via heparin groups and form a trail along which cells can migrate, called haptotaxis (Roy et al., 2017). Diffusible gradients of chemoattractants represent a much greater challenge because of the cellular constraints of the sensitivity of chemoattractant receptors and the effects of oversaturation leading to desensitization. To overcome these constraints, cells can undergo a form of selfgenerated chemotaxis where chemokines in the immediate vicinity of the cell are broken down, allowing sampling of incoming gradients. The cell can then decide where the highest concentration gradient is relative to its position by creating proximal gradients (Tweedy et al., 2020). Interestingly, neutrophil-derived proteases can also degrade extracellular matrix (ECM) components to liberate bioactive ECM-derived fragment chemokines, such as proline-glycine-proline (Patel and Snelgrove, 2018a). Importantly, although integrins may not be required for interstitial migration, their involvement in sensing cues within tissue seem pivotal in terms of their involvement in activating many different effector functions across all immune cell lineages (Abram and Lowell, 2009). The complexities of tissues and sensing of guide-like cues in vivo remain a great challenge.

After migrating through the tissue and reaching the site of injury, neutrophils often display swarming behavior, where many neutrophils interact in a homotypic fashion, forming large clusters (Lammermann et al., 2013). Integrins, which are largely € required for extravasation but not interstitial migration, play a fundamental role in formation of neutrophil clusters. Thus, the machinery used for migration can also be utilized in the context of homotypic neutrophil interactions and has been shown to be beneficial in limiting the spread of infection (Poplimont et al., 2020). Indeed, integrin engagement primes and potentiates neutrophil effector functions more generally, and integrin should be viewed as a co-stimulatory molecule (Bouti et al., 2021).

## Neutrophils and microbes

Commensal or pathogenic microorganisms penetrate host tissues by several mechanisms, like traversing mucosal membranes or through skin lesions. Most microbes are recognized rapidly by neutrophils and then attacked and eliminated (Klebanoff et al., 2013; Nauseef and Borregaard, 2014). Neutrophils identify microbes through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that bind microbial structures (Kobayashi et al., 2018). In addition, soluble proteins, like antibodies or complement, can opsonize microbes, allowing efficient recognition and uptake or degranulation by neutrophils (Figure 2). Upon ligand binding, receptors switch on diverse signal transduction machineries, coordinating a variety of cellular pathways to initiate the antimicrobial response (Bardoel et al., 2014; Ne ' meth et al., 2020). Neutrophils may also sense microbes through receptors common with epithelial cell-mediated inflammation. Indeed, in vitro data suggest that neutrophils recognize serum opsonized Candida albicans through Ephrin type A receptor 2 (EphA2), which increases Fc g receptor-mediated fungicidal activity (Swidergall et al., 2019). Neutrophils might also sense the size of yeast by a ROS-mediated mechanism and partially tune their inflammatory response (Warnatsch et al., 2017).

Negative regulators of neutrophil antimicrobial activity are poorly characterized. Hou et al. (2018) identified that inositol hexakisphosphate kinase 1 (Ip6K1), produced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS)stimulated platelets, inhibits generation of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5 P3 (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3) by neutrophils blocking recruitment of pleckstrin homology domain-containing proteins to the plasma membrane, interfering with phagocytosis and ROS production. Production of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 by phosphatidy-

Neutrophils are at the forefront of recognition and subsequent killing of invading pathogens. Neutrophils are equipped with an extensive array of pathogen recognition receptors ranging from the TLR family to specialized Dectin-1 molecules that recognize a plethora of proteins and sugar molecules. In addition, neutrophils recognize a vast range of opsonization products through specific receptors. When recognized, neutrophils expose pathogens to its vast armamentarium of toxic products, such as myeloperoxidase (MPO), NE, ROS, and cytokines. Neutrophils deploy their toxic mediators via a range of active processes, such as phagocytosis, formation of NETs, and degranulation, or by producing exosomes.

linositol 3-kinase (PI3K) is key for recruiting effector proteins to the membrane, regulating a plethora of processes in neutrophils (like phagocytosis), and production of NADPH, potentiating killing of microbes. By inhibiting Ip6K1, excessive production of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 leads to favorable outcomes in a number of disease models, and despite the neutrophils being more effective at killing microbes, far less immunopathology has been observed, at least in the lungs. These results demonstrate that, even when neutrophils are hyperactivated, clearance of infection can limit immunopathology, presumably as a consequence of altered infection kinetics.

Microbe-derived components might also induce onset of allergic asthma in a neutrophil-mediated manner (Radermecker et al., 2019). Interestingly, activated neutrophils release vesicles during degranulation, containing neutrophil elastase (NE), which can degrade and shape the ECM (Genschmer et al., 2019). Nonetheless, it remains a great challenge to observe the in vivo dynamics of exosome formation and degranulation.

Pathogens evolved mechanisms to counteract neutrophils; for example, by secreting enzymes, like catalase, to reduce ROS or DNases to degrade NETs (Urban et al., 2006). Microbial evasion strategies target oxidative and non-oxidative neutrophil effector pathways. Yersinia pestis inhibits degranulation and synthesis of leukotriene B4 (LTB4) to silence the inflammatory response early in infection (Pulsifer et al., 2020). Pseudomonas aeruginosa secretes two effectors, ExoS and ExoT, that block ROS production Ras-dependently and Ras-independently, respectively, protecting the microbe from reactive intermediates (Vareechon et al., 2017). P. aeruginosa uses lactone-derived compounds, which are used in quorum sensing, to interfere with the plasma membrane integrity, killing the neutrophil (Song et al., 2019). Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae subverts host nucleases, like DNase1, to cleave NETs and uses the degradation products for growth (de Buhr et al., 2019). Evasion strategies can be two-pronged: to evade killing and to profit from the generated products.

Neutrophils are the first immune cells to reach sites of viral infection, but their antiviral response is not well defined (Naumenko et al., 2018). Neutrophils can control bacteria or fungi that follow viral infection. Notably, in influenza-associated pneumonia, the number of neutrophils in the lower respiratory tract correlates with disease severity (Camp and Jonsson, 2017). Furthermore, in individuals with severe influenza, neutrophils

## Review

are enriched in genes involved in NET formation (Tang et al., 2019). In severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, neutrophils may contribute to the inflammatory phenotype (Fox et al., 2020). In individuals with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), NET markers correlate with disease severity and implicate neutrophils in the pathology of this disease. Additionally, NET-containing microthrombi have been detected in individuals who succumbed to SARS-CoV-2 infection (Middleton et al., 2020; Zuo et al., 2020).

## Neutrophil heterogeneity

Immune cells of the adaptive and innate system have the ability to utilize specific transcription factors that determine cell behaviors by altering protein expression and, thereby, dictating specialized functions during the course of an infection. Importantly, no transcription factors have been identified in activated neutrophils that polarize them to perform a specific function. Thus, neutrophil subsets have not, bona fide , been demonstrated, including classification of neutrophils into ''N1'' and ''N2'' in cancer models (Fridlender et al., 2009). Phenotypic heterogeneity has, however, been described, which may reflect varying maturation or activation states. For example, in the context of pathogen interactions, signaling pathways that engage the cellular machinery without requiring any further differentiation may drive heterogeneity (Deniset et al., 2017; Kamenyeva et al., 2015; Kennedy and DeLeo, 2009; Lawrence et al., 2018; Pillay et al., 2012). Importantly, sex makes a difference in neutrophils; neutrophils isolated from females are hyper-responsive and prone to produce interferon in response to Toll activators, whereas neutrophils in males have a higher mitochondrial metabolism, and these differences are likely hormone driven (Gupta et al., 2020).

In homeostasis, only fully differentiated neutrophils are released from the bone marrow. However, during infection and other pathologies, granulopoiesis increases, and immature neutrophils, also called ''band cells'' because of the shape of their not fully lobulated nucleus, enter the circulation. Indeed, specific granulocyte-monocyte progenitors are released; for example, during sepsis (Kwok et al., 2020). Whether band cells are a functionally divergent subset of neutrophils requires further investigation despite most suppositions that these neutrophils are merely immature and exit the bone marrow prematurely. In a mouse model of Streptococcus pneumonia infection, banded cells in the spleen have been posited to be immature neutrophils, based on surface expression of certain proteins, that proliferate, mobilize, and become phagocytic upon infection (Deniset et al., 2017). Despite this intriguing observation, neutrophil proliferation has been demonstrated using Ki67, which does not only signify cell division in neutrophils but also NET production (Amulic et al., 2017). If neutrophils proliferate in the periphery, then a completely new paradigm of neutrophil homeostasis would have to be formulated. Whether this ''immature'' population of neutrophils represents a functional population of neutrophils or simply acts as a rapid source of in situ quiescent immature cells that, upon infection, can mobilize and become functional requires further investigation.

Furthermore, in mice, neutrophils that are in circulation for more than 6 h decrease CD62L and increase CD11b and CXCR4 expression, their nuclei are hypersegmentated, and

<!-- image -->

they tend to make more NETs (Adrover et al., 2020). Interestingly, the chemokine CXCL2 regulates circadian function of neutrophils. Neutrophils are more prone to migrate into tissue and are more antimicrobial diurnally (Adrover et al., 2019). Thus, neutrophils enhance their function during the day, probably an adaptation linked to the possibility of infection because of an animal's behavior.

In individuals suffering from autoimmunity, there is a population of low-density granulocytes (LDGs) in circulation. LDGs are heterogeneous and might represent immature and partially degranulated neutrophils that behave differently depending on the disease or, possibly, even a pathological subset of neutrophils that have not differentiated properly (Mistry et al., 2019; Sagiv et al., 2015). Whether LDGs are a cause or a consequence of disease is unknown. Finally, tumor-associated neutrophils have been demonstrated to have unique antigen-presenting capabilities, but these data are difficult to interpret because contamination of isolated neutrophils with even a few dendritic cells could confound these results, and so monitoring of cell purity after isolation is required (Singhal et al., 2016).

Cytoplasmic proteins may mark distinct neutrophil populations. Olfactomedin 4 (OLF4) is a cytoplasmic glycoprotein expressed exclusively in 20% of the neutrophil population in a healthy individual; the percentage of neutrophils expressing this protein increases in sepsis. Expression of OLFM4 does not correlate with cell behaviors, and its function is unknown (Alder et al., 2017). Interestingly, NETs derived from OLM4-positive neutrophils contain this protein, suggesting that not all NETs have the same proteome. Whether this has functional implications requires further investigation.

In spite of some early data (Mauer et al., 1960), healthy tissues have been thought to be neutrophil free. Interestingly, neutrophils expressing a specific CD11b/L-selectin/CXCR4 ratio are found in the lung vasculature (Choudhury et al., 2019; Kim et al., 2018). Furthermore, although short lived, neutrophils infiltrate unperturbed tissues for several hours. These ''tissue-resident'' neutrophils express a transcriptional program of non-immune-related functions, like angiogenesis, in the lungs and intestine (Ballesteros et al., 2020) and might be involved in tissue homeostasis.

Neutrophils are heterogeneous, but the proof required to posit that subsets with specific transcriptional programs that drive further differentiation and unique intrinsic cell functions is not available. The notion of cell subsets within the immune system faces many investigative challenges. In the past, cell types have been classified by morphology, ontogeny, molecular composition, and function, but no single attribute has been able to account for any cell type. Cells of the immune system have a complex history, can locate to and navigate virtually every tissue, are affected by the internal and external environment, interact with many different types of other cells, and must have foresight with regard to certain circumstances so that they can act effectively. Although classification of the 5 different types of immune cells is broadly agreed upon, subsets pose a much greater challenge. However, if neutrophil subsets truly do exist, then their delineation would have obvious implications with regard to therapeutic strategies in the myriad of diseases that have been shown to involve neutrophil biology.

Figure 3. Glucose and oxygen have dual roles in neutrophil functionality

<!-- image -->

Glucose metabolism and oxygen are critical for mediating the recruitment and functionality of neutrophils upon activation. Glucose is used (1) to generate ATP through oxygen-independent glycolysis and (2) to produce NADPH in the PPP. This NADPH is used by NADPH oxidase to generate ROS, a process that does require oxygen. Hence, glucose is essential for energy production and neutrophil effector functions. Neutrophils do not depend on the citric acid cycle to produce ATP and therefore do not depend on oxygen for their energy production, but oxygen is essential for production of ROS. Glucose availability or altered intracellular glucose flow can affect neutrophil function, as highlighted in conditions such as diabetes and uremia. Additionally, low oxygen levels at inflammatory sites or high oxygen levels in the lung alveoli or in in vitro experiments potentially also affect neutrophil functions.

## Neutrophil glucose and oxygen metabolism

When performing their designated tasks, neutrophils expend a large amount of energy. Glucose and oxygen are key factors in the energy metabolism of most eukaryotic cells. Glucose is converted into pyruvate through glycolysis, generating 2 ATP molecules. Subsequently, pyruvate can be processed through oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondria to produce ~34 molecules of ATP. Neutrophils contain very few mitochondria (compared with other leukocytes) and depend mainly on glycolysis to produce ATP, allowing energy generation in low-oxygen environments (Borregaard and Herlin, 1982; Maianski et al., 2004; Pearce and Pearce, 2013). The antimicrobial response in neutrophils depends on oxygen, which is used by NADPH oxidase to generate superoxide. Thus, the dependence of neutrophils on glycolysis could be an adaptation to allow oxygen to be converted into superoxide rather than entering oxidative phosphorylation (Reiss and Roos, 1978; Figure 3).

In a ROS burst, NADPH is required and depleted quickly; hence, its (re)generation is key in neutrophil functionality. NADPH is synthesized from glucose 6-phosphate in the oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway (oxPPP), which is critical for ROS formation (Azevedo et al., 2015). Indeed, neutrophils from individuals with a defect in the first enzyme of the oxPPP, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH), suffer from reduced NADPH levels, cannot make ROS or produce NETs, and are susceptible to bacterial infections (Siler et al., 2017). In addition, pharmacological inhibition of transketolase (TKT) or a genetic deficiency in transaldolase 1, enzymes of the non-oxidative PPP that facilitate conversion of oxPPP reaction products back into glucose 6-phosphate, also inhibit ROS production

and NET formation (Riyapa et al., 2019). The non-linear and complex nature of enzymatic pathways can make it difficult to understand which downstream outputs are directly involved in pathology because many different products are produced from one pathway intermediate. In addition, not all antimicrobial neutrophil functions rely on ROS, and whether the observed inhibition of ROS formation and NET production also affected microbial killing was not tested in the above studies. These data suggest an intricate, interdependent connection of glucose and oxygen in production of ATP and NADPH-oxidase produced ROS. Last, human phenotypes from genetic deficiencies can also be difficult to interpret because these metabolic pathways are present in all cells, presumably affecting many different facets of human biology.

Inflammatory sites are hypoxic and poor in nutrients, and we do not fully understand how these conditions affect neutrophils. Recent findings indicate that neutrophils are the only myeloid cell type capable of gluconeogenesis and glycogenesis, explaining their ability to generate ATP in low-glucose and lowoxygen environments (Sadiku et al., 2021). Hyperglycaemia, under normoxic conditions, induces NETs and depends on NADPHoxidase, the oxPPP, and glucose, suggesting that neutrophils are sensitive to changes in glucose concentration (Wang et al., 2019). Conversely, glucose starvation is detrimental to neutrophils. In individuals with end-stage kidney disease, uremia inhibits glucose uptake by hyperactivating glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3 b ), impairing ROS formation in neutrophils and fungal killing (Jawale et al., 2020). These individuals suffer from disseminated candidiasis, and GSK3 b inhibition restores neutrophil function and ameliorates fungal disease in mouse models. Anti-fungal drugs are nephrotoxic, suggesting that manipulating neutrophil metabolism by correcting glucose uptake might be therapeutic in fungal infections.

Glucose availability might modulate the flow of glucosederived products through glycolysis and the PPP and, in turn, affect ROS production and NET formation. Transcription factors that regulate the PPP, such as nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Pa ˚ lsson-McDermott and O'Neill, 2020), which is expressed by neutrophils (Joshi and Werner, 2017), may regulate NADPH-dependent responses. In addition to the effects of varying extracellular glucose levels or altered glucose uptake, dysregulated intracellular glucose flow affects neutrophils. Neutrophils from individuals with glycogen storage disease type Ib (GSD-1b) or those with a glucose-6-phosphatase 3 defect accumulate a glycolysis-inhibiting analog of glucose in the cytoplasm, blocking ATP production and NADPH synthesis. This decreases ROS production, chemotaxis, and bactericidal activity while increasing apoptosis (Veiga-da-Cunha et al., 2019). Remarkably, Wortmann et al. (2020) have shown that treating individuals with GSD-1b with a sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, an anti-diabetic drug that inhibits renal reabsorption of glucose and facilitates excretion of the inhibitory glucose analog, resolves neutropenia and neutrophil dysfunction. These studies emphasize the central role of glucose in energy metabolism and NADPH oxidase-dependent neutrophil responses, and the apparent intricate connections between the involved metabolites underline the need for a better understanding of glucose flux in neutrophils.

Neutrophils and their products exhibit diverse roles that can promote tumor regression or enhance tumor expansion and metastasis. Neutrophils produce ROS and ATP, which directly attack tumor cells while they also produce cytokines to promote T cell antitumor properties. In contrasting fashion, neutrophil-derived products can also promote tumor expansion by promoting tumor cell migration, expansion, and angiogenesis and inhibiting cytolytic T cell function. Furthermore, neutrophil serine proteases and NETs can pave the way for metastatic cells to escape tumor sites and spread to different tissues.

At inflammatory sites, neutrophils contribute to hypoxia through use of oxygen during generation of ROS (Campbell et al., 2014). As a response to hypoxia, the transcription factors hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1 a and HIF-2 a safeguard neutrophil viability and functionality at inflammatory sites (Walmsley et al., 2005). Indeed, neutrophils incubated under anoxic conditions with pharmacological inhibition of HIF1a degradation are prevented from entering apoptosis for up to 20 h with no loss of morphology or functionality compared with untreated isolated neutrophils, and these cells are amenable to gene silencing (Monceaux et al., 2016). Talla et al. (2019) have shown that neutrophil survival under hypoxic conditions is associated with autophagosome activation. Interestingly, in this study, the capacity for oxidant production was lost after prolonged exposure to hypoxic conditions (&gt;5 h), but the capacity to kill Staphylococcus aureus in an oxygen-independent manner was enhanced, suggesting that the neutrophil may utilize its bactericidal arsenal depending on the microbe it encounters. Considering the fact that most in vitro experiments with neutrophils are performed under atmospheric oxygen pressure (160 mm Hg), whereas in vivo oxygen pressure ranges from 10 mm Hg in inflamed tissue to 100 mm Hg in the lung alveoli (Sitkovsky and Lukashev, 2005), and the effect of oxygen pressure on neutrophil functionality, some concern regarding the interpreta-

tion of data generated in vitro is warranted. It is clear that glucose and oxygen are central in an intricate network of energy metabolism and antimicrobial effector functions. The varying levels of glucose and oxygen encountered in vivo may significantly affect neutrophil functionality and suggest that neutrophils possess unique functional flexibility.

## Neutrophils and cancer

Around 50% of the world's population is affected by cancer at some point during their lifetime, and neutrophils have a pivotal role in oncogenesis. The neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio is prognostic in some cancers, indicating that neutrophils might be relevant in the progression or regression of the disease. Most of the literature on neutrophils and cancer regards experimental models, and the clinical significance of these findings in humans should be explored further (Eruslanov et al., 2017). Neutrophils in circulation, LDGs, and tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs) can restrict or promote cancer and metastasis. It is unclear whether the antior pro-tumor activity of neutrophils is due to specific activation or a developmentally pre-determined cell, as discussed earlier in this review (Shaul and Fridlender, 2019; Figure 4).

Neutrophils can fight malignancies, although detailed mechanistic insights are lacking. For example, in colon cancer, high neutrophil counts are a good prognosis (Governa et al., 2017), and in breast cancer models, depletion of neutrophils allows disease progression (Granot et al., 2011). Macrophages can activate neutrophils through interferons to secrete chemokines and cytokines that activate the immune system (Hagerling et al., 2019). Neutrophils can also attack cancer cells directly by producing ROS and ATP (Patel et al., 2018b).

Conversely, neutrophils can also promote tumors and metastasis by increasing angiogenesis (Ballesteros et al., 2020), cell motility, migration, and invasion (Shaul and Fridlender, 2018). Interestingly, inducing neutrophil infiltration in a mouse model of metastatic lung cancer by LPS promotes metastasis (El Rayes et al., 2015), and, accordingly, neutrophil depletion in a different mouse model of primary lung cancer driven oncogenic K-ras prevents metastasis (Faget et al., 2017). One drawback when interpreting these studies is the differential use of mouse models and the heterogenous nature of cancer evolution. There are probably several mechanisms for tumor promotion, and some are indirect; for example, by suppressing (Coffelt et al., 2015) or killing (Michaeli et al., 2017) cytotoxic T cells (cytotoxic T lymphocytes [CTLs]) that eliminate tumors directly in vitro and in vivo , as demonstrated by CAR (chimeric antigen receptor)-T cell therapies. The direct effects of neutrophils on cancer cells include the intriguing observation that circulating tumor cells associated with neutrophils are more proliferative and metastatic (Szczerba et al., 2019) and supply lipids to tumor cells, fueling their proliferation and metastasis (Li et al., 2020). Also, neutrophils could amplify DNA damage in cancer cells through ROS, although this result is hard to reconcile with the short-lived nature of reactive intermediates and their products (Wculek et al., 2020).

NETs, as first shown by Zuo et al. (2020), promote metastasis by several mechanisms. Serine proteases, like NE and cathepsin G (CG) (El Rayes et al., 2015), awaken dormant breast cancer cells by cleaving the ECM protein lamin, creating an epitope that binds to tumor integrins, which, in turn, leads to proliferation, migration, and other pro-survival pathways (Albrengues et al.,

<!-- image -->

2018; Rayes et al., 2020). NETs also attract cancer cells that metastasize to the liver in individuals with breast and colon cancer (Hawes et al., 2015; Yang et al., 2020a). NETs might also protect tumor cells from CTLs (Teijeira et al., 2020). An indirect deleterious effect of NETs in cancer is promotion of thrombosis (Demers and Wagner, 2014). Individuals who succumb to thrombosis are sometimes diagnosed with cancer only post mortem (Tha ˚ lin et al., 2016). Interestingly, citrullinated histone 3 (H3cit) in circulation, a marker for NETs, has prognostic value for venous thrombosis (Mauracher et al., 2018). These data suggest that detecting and restricting NETs could be a relevant tool in cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and metastasis prevention.

Neutrophils are already implicated in cancer therapy. Drugs which successfully interfere with oncogenic signaling in tumor cells through the receptor tyrosine kinase mesenchymal endothelial transition kinase (c-MET). c-MET inhibition also blocks neutrophil recruitment into tumors and draining lymph nodes. This absence of neutrophils allows T cell expansion, which, in turn, promotes tumor elimination (Glodde et al., 2017). In antibody cancer therapy, neutrophils bind to cancer cells, initiating antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), and kill them by trogopcytosis or possibly even degranulation (Matlung et al., 2018).

## Neutrophils interaction with other cells

Neutrophils are thought of as individualistic primitive killers of infectious agents that lack complex decision-making capabilities and act alone. However, this dogma has been challenged with the experimental demonstration that neutrophils, their products, and their ability to interact with other cell types can, in fact, elegantly shape many facets of the immune response. A variety of transcriptomics and proteomics approaches indicate that neutrophils produce chemokines and cytokines that interact with other leukocytes (Tamassia et al., 2018). Nonetheless, animal models and in vitro experiments that underpin the physiological aspects by which neutrophils dictate the function of innate and adaptive cells during an immune response are foretelling.

Macrophages are essential for regulating tissue homeostasis by producing cytokines, and this can be driven, directly or indirectly, by neutrophils and their products. For example, in an influenza model, neutrophils prime the inflammasome and interleukin-1 b (IL-1 b ) production from alveolar macrophages via the antimicrobial peptide murine cathelicidin-related antimicrobial peptide (mCRAMP) (Peiro ' et al., 2018). Whether antimicrobial peptides more generally have the ability to prime inflammasomes, and through which mechanism, requires more investigation. In addition, NETs, and maybe other neutrophil functions, may promote expression of IL-1 b by macrophages in atherosclerosis to drive inflammation during plaque formation (Warnatsch et al., 2015). The mouse model used for this study was on a proteinase 3/NE/ApoE compound-deficient background, and so other neutrophil functions might also be important here because these proteases are not utilized solely in the context of NET formation. In contrast, in certain scenarios, neutrophils can halt macrophage activation and macrophageinduced reparative responses, probably by inhibiting nuclear factor k B (NFk B) signaling in macrophages and suppressing cytokine production (Marwick et al., 2018). In an acute liver injury mouse model, neutrophil-derived ROS trigger monocytes to

<!-- image -->

differentiate into a pro-repair Ly6C lo monocyte that produces hepatocyte growth factor, which promotes tissue resolution (Yang et al., 2019). In keeping with this observation, individuals with CGD are hyper-inflammatory, suggesting, paradoxically, given the ability of reactive intermediates to cause tissue damage and inflammation, that ROS might also be anti-inflammatory.

Similar to macrophages, neutrophils can positively or negatively regulate multiple dendritic cell (DC) types. Neutrophils have been demonstrated to promote DC recruitment, potentiating DC functions in antigen presentation and DC induction of T cell responses. In allergy and fungal models, neutrophils promote conventional DC recruitment to sites of inflammation and subsequent antigen trafficking to draining lymph nodes (Krishnamoorthy et al., 2018; Souwer et al., 2018; Weber et al., 2015). NETs also modulate CD11b + DC function by enhancing uptake of antigens in an allergic airway disease model; however, the differences in uptake, although significant, are small, and T cell priming by DCs that acquire antigens from NETs has not been investigated (Radermecker et al., 2019). In addition to promoting DC recruitment and antigen presentation, apoptotic neutrophils also induce differentiation of monocytes to monocyte-derived DCs via production of epidermal growth factor (EGF) in a mouse model of respiratory viral infection (Lim et al., 2020). Neutrophils also potentiate CD4 + T cell polarization toward T helper 17 cell subsets by DCs during antigen presentation via direct contact (Krishnamoorthy et al., 2018) or indirect mechanisms (Souwer et al., 2018). In addition, neutrophils have been shown to drive plasmacytoid DC (pDC) recruitment and interferon production via secretion of chemokines (Guo et al., 2020) and autoreactive DNA and antimicrobial peptides (Diana et al., 2013; Lande et al., 2011). The relative contributions of direct versus indirect mechanisms will require further experimental dissection. In certain contexts, neutrophils and their products can also halt DC function. For example, CG perturbs IL-12 production by DCsand subsequent Th1 cell polarization in a hapten skin sensitization model (Kish et al., 2019). Whether neutrophils affect DC function to guide T cell polarization to a specific T cell subtype warrants further investigation.

Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are a class of innate immune cells shown to modulate inflammation and disease via their potent capability to secrete cytokines and growth factors. Surprisingly, neutrophil and ILC interactions have not been studied extensively despite some interesting observations from previous studies. A microarray analysis of neutrophils from an N. brasiliensis model of infection demonstrated that neutrophils are a major source of the chemokine CCL8 (Chen et al., 2014), a key chemokine that promotes type 2 ILC (ILC2) migration and positioning within tissue (Puttur et al., 2019). Neutrophils are also important for regulating granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) concentration via the IL-17-IL-23 axis, but when neutrophils are depleted, excess G-CSF promotes excessive cytokine production for ILC2s in an animal model of asthma. Such a finding may rationalize the limited efficacy of neutrophil-blocking therapeutic agent in asthma clinical trials. It has been shown previously that type-3 ILCs are a direct source of IL-17, which, in turn, promotes neutrophilic recruitment, but recently it has also been demonstrated that ILCs indirectly promote neutrophilic inflammation by triggering release of a mouse RNase homolog called eosinophil-associated ribonuclease 11 (Panova et al., 2021).

Review

Correlations between NET formation and innate immune activation have been described, and concerted efforts have been made to specifically identify components in NETs that interact with immune cells. For example, H3cit complexed with DNA in NETs induces cytokine production from isolated blood monocytes via Toll-liked receptor 4 (TLR4) activation (Tsourouktsoglou et al., 2020), whereas DNA and RNA in NETs decorated with the antimicrobial peptide LL37 are able to trigger TLR8 signaling (Herster et al., 2020). Not just protein components of NETs facilitate these functions. Linhares-Lacerda et al. (2020) observed that NETs also contain bioactive microRNAs, with miRNA-142-3p able to trigger tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFa ) production from macrophages.Given the ubiquitous nature of RNases in the extracellular space, it would be interesting to investigate in vivo whether such a phenomenon can occur. Macrophages can also phagocytose NETs that translocate from the phagosome into the cytosol and activate the DNA sensor cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS), inducing type I interferon (Apel et al., 2021).

A number of publications link neutrophils with lymphocyte responses. Almost 50 years ago, neutrophils were shown to be present in sheep lymph (Smith et al., 1970). Since then, neutrophils have been identified in lymph, lymph nodes, and even ectopic lymphoid tissue using various techniques and therefore form part of an immunological hub that promotes adaptive immunity (Abadie et al., 2005; Tacchini-Cottier et al., 2000). Furthermore, neutrophils might traffic antigens to lymph nodes, where they express both classes of major histocompatibility proteins (Hulsdunker et al., 2018; Liang et al., 2017; Lok et al., 2019) € € and could present antigens to T cells (Vono et al., 2017). The molecular mechanisms by which neutrophils traffic antigen into the lymph nodes remain incompletely understood, but major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II expression could be upregulated after neutrophil activation or phagocytosis. Whether this putative neutrophil antigen presentation is biologically significant compared with professional antigen-presenting cells is not known. Neutrophils may also suppress T cell responses. Neutrophil production of ROS (Aarts et al., 2019), expression of PDL-1 (Langereis et al., 2017), and overexpression of arginase-1 (Marini et al., 2017) have been credited with disrupting T cell function and polarization. Also, neutrophils express inhibitory surface proteins, such as CD10, that can suppress T cell function (Marini et al., 2017).

After antigen-presentation, neutrophils also directly affect ensuing B cell responses, particularly in autoimmune disease and cancer. For example, neutrophils are a source of cytokines, such as B cell activating factor of the tumor necrosis factor fam--ily (BAFF) (Parsa et al., 2016) and a proliferation inducing ligand -(APRIL) (Huard et al., 2008), that promote B cell expansion and plasma cell differentiation. Among other studies, Puga et al. (2011) describe a B helper neutrophil that directly interacts with splenic B cells and promotes B cell expansion and immunoglobulin diversification during infection. The molecular and functional details of this B helper neutrophil liaison remain obscure and should be characterized further.

Interestingly, we hardly understand how neutrophils interact with cells of mesodermal origin. As neutrophils migrate and exert their functions in infected or damaged tissue, they interact with resident cells, and these interactions are likely a fruitful field for future research.

Neutrophils express a number of immune cell lineagerestricted serine proteases. These proteases also possess a remarkable capacity to sculpt the inflammatory response, particularly via modulation of secreted inflammatory mediators. Incubation of a range of cytokines and chemokines with neutrophil serine proteases such as NE, PR-3 and CG often lead to cleavage of these signaling molecules at specific amino acids sites, rendering these cleaved fragments hypo- or hyperactive. The IL-1 cytokine family contains several pro-inflammatory cytokines in pro-forms that require cleavage to active forms, rendering them able to bind their cognate receptors. NE, PR3, and CG can cleave IL-1 a and IL-33 (Lefranc ¸ ais et al., 2012), which drives recruitment and activation of ILC2s, and they can cleave all subtypes of IL-36 (IL-36 a , IL-36 b , and IL-36 g ), which potentiates their ability to promote IL-6 and IL-8 production from HeLa cells (Clancy et al., 2018). Importantly, caspases are essential for activating IL-1 cytokines intracellularly; the contribution of IL-1 cytokine cleavage by neutrophil proteases in the absence of caspase activation needs further investigation. Neutrophil proteases can also impart effects on secreted cytokine bioavailability. For example, TNFa is initially produced in a membrane-bound form that requires TNF -a -converting enzyme (TACE) cleavage to form soluble TNFa . In addition to TACE, PR-3 produced by neutrophils can also cleave TNFa and subsequently increase TNFa bioavailability (Armstrong et al., 2009).

In addition to its pro-inflammatory effects, neutrophil proteases can also inactivate cytokines, including IL-1 b (Clancy et al., 2018), MIP-1 a (Ryu et al., 2005), and stromal cell-derived factor-1 a (SDF1 a ) (Rao et al., 2004), affecting the functions of this diverse group of proteins. Given the discrepant pro-inflammatory and regulatory roles neutrophil proteases impart on cytokines and chemokines, it will be important to assess the relevance of such findings in vivo , especially because these aforementioned studies are largely conducted in in vitro assays. Neutrophil proteases have preferred amino acid cleavage sites within proteins to which access could be regulated by the structure of the chemokine or cytokine. Further studies assessing the accessibility of these cleavage sites could help us understand why specific signaling molecules are selectively cleaved by neutrophil proteases but also attribute the discrepant pro-inflammatory or regulator effects of these proteases on individual cytokines or chemokines.

## Challenges

Studying neutrophils is challenging in vitro and in animal models. Isolating large numbers of pure human neutrophils is possible, even in quantities required for biochemical assays. The limitation is that these cells naturally undergo apoptosis within hours of isolation, precluding any genetic manipulation. There are cell lines that recapitulate some of the characteristics of mature neutrophils, but none of them have the antimicrobial capacity of isolated cells. Protocols to differentiate stem cells of different origins into truly active neutrophils are currently being developed and will be a great resource for research, especially for genetic studies. Although research in mouse models has advanced our understanding of neutrophils, in these animals, neutrophils are far less abundant and behave differently in many assays compared with humancells. Indeed, caution is necessary to directly translate murine data into medicine. Zebrafish are another model to study neutrophils, which has already yielded surprising results. Whether

<!-- image -->

other animals are good models to understand the biology of neutrophils is an exciting challenge.

The unique characteristics of neutrophils are already being explored by unbiased classical approaches like RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) transcriptomics and proteomics. Neutrophils, probably because of their essential role in immunity, are attracting research from other fields, like biophysics and mathematical modeling, which will enrich our understanding of these cells. The pharmaceutical industry has been traditionally shy in targeting neutrophils because their depletion leads to infections; however, an interest in modulating these cells is emerging (Ne ' meth et al., 2020).

Neutrophils are sentinel cells that patrol, survey, and eliminate threats within the host. Classically, these threats were thought to arise as a consequence of an infectious breach of host barriers. Contemporary data suggest that endogenous threats, in the form of cancer for example, are also subject to regulation and elimination by neutrophils. Furthermore, neutrophil biology is increasingly implicated during pathogenic autoimmunity/inflammation, indicating that, under circumstances of misregulation, the consequences can be dire, possibly even fatal. Given that the neutrophil is more generally involved in host homeostasis than previously thought, it is likely to have evolved mechanisms that protect the host not only from infection but a myriad of other host-destabilizing processes, such as stress. The mystique of a neutrophil should encourage more investigations into exactly how this cell is able to coordinate and operate an appropriate response, without killing the host via its biotoxic activity, that, when activated, will not discriminate between friend and foe.
