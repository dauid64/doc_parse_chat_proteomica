## Abstract

Life on Earth developed in the presence and under the constant influence of gravity. Gravity has been present during the entire evolution, from the first organic molecule to mammals and humans. Modern research revealed clearly that gravity is important, probably indispensable for the function of living systems, from unicellular organisms to men. Thus, gravity research is no more or less a fundamental  question  about  the  conditions  of  life  on  Earth.  Since  the  first  space  missions  and supported thereafter by a multitude of space and ground-based experiments, it is well known that immune cell function is severely suppressed in microgravity, which renders the cells of the immune system an ideal model organism to investigate the influence of gravity on the cellular and molecular level.  Here  we  review  the  current  knowledge  about  the  question,  if  and  how  cellular  signal transduction depends on the existence of gravity, with special focus on cells of the immune system. Since immune cell function is fundamental to keep the organism under imnological surveillance during the defence against pathogens, to investigate the effects and possible molecular mechanisms of  altered  gravity  is  indispensable  for  long-term  space  flights  to  Earth  Moon  or  Mars.  Thus, understanding the impact of gravity on cellular functions on Earth will provide not only important informations  about  the  development  of  life  on  Earth,  but  also  for  therapeutic  and  preventive strategies to cope successfully with medical problems during space exploration.

## The "immune problem" in space

Early  reports  about  disturbed  immune  cell  function  in space date back in the 70ties, where reduced reactivity of blood lymphoid cells has been discovered in crew members of Soyuz spaceships and of Skylab and Apollo [1,2]. Recently, a subclinical re-activation varicella zoster virus (VZV) has been reported in astronauts [3,4], a virus which becomes latent in the nervous system after primary infection, but is reactivated frequently in immune suppressed individuals,  such  as  after  organ  transplantation,  and  in patients with cancer or AIDS. Whereas it is well known that gravity can be perceived by gravireceptors (statocyst-

like  organelles or gravisensitive ion channels in the cell membrane) in unicellular organisms such as Paramecium and Loxodes, where it strongly influences intracellular signal  transduction  and  behaviour  [5,6],  the  molecular mechanisms  of  gravisensitivity  in  mammalian  cells  are widely unknown. After the pioneering discovery of Cogoli et al. at the first Spacelab-Mission 20 years ago [7], it is known  that  proliferative  response  of  lymphocytes  after mitogenic stimulation is suppressed in microgravity [8]. In follow-up experiments in order to verify the result from Spacelab 1, it has been demonstrated clearly that factors other than microgravity can be excluded to be responsible

for the depressed activation of lymphocytes. Whereas the phenomenon  of  reduced  activation  of  T  cells  during microgravity  is  well  described  [9,10]  and  verified,  the exact molecular mechanisms are not elucidated.

## Signal transduction and cell-cell communication is disturbed in microgravity

Several investigations evidence alterations in signal transduction  in  lymphocytes.  In  lymphocytes,  microgravity affected the protein kinase C [11,12] whereas delivery of first activation signal, patching and capping of conA-binding membrane proteins occurred normally in spaceflight [13]. These findings suggest the existence of gravisensitive cellular targets upstream from PKC and downstream from the TCR/CD3, where the lipid-raft-associated membraneproximal  signalosome  complex  is  located.  DNA  array analysis of T cells subjected to simulated microgravity provided by the random-positioning machine (RPM) revealed an alteration of several signal moduls, in particular NF-kB and MAPK-signaling [14]. Also the expression of the early oncogenes c-fos, c-myc and c-jun is inhibited during spaceflight [summarized in [15]].

In other studies, gravisensitivity of pro-  and  antiapoptotic pathways has been reported in human mononuclear cells [16], human ML-1 thyroid-carcinoma cells [17] and astrocytes  [18]  in  simulated  microgravity.  On  the  molecular level,  simulated  microgravity  induced  fas,  p53  and  bax and reduced bcl-2 [17,19]. Interestingly, the expression of fas was elevated in Jurkat-T-cells also during space flights of the shuttle missions STS-80 and STS-95 [20], suggesting an  enhanced  fas-fasL-mediated  apoptosis  of  immune cells.  During  a  14-days  space  flight  (SLS-2-mission)  an accumulation of p53 has been found in keratinocytes and myocytes, indicating that central regulatory molecules of nuclear signal transduction and cell cycle are influenced by gravity [21]. The diminished proliferative response of T cells upon stimulation during microgravity could also be caused by a reduced expression of IL-2 receptor as demonstrated in simulated microgravity [22,23], resulting in an impairment of positive regulatory feedback loops. Overall, a decreased capacity of T-cells for the production of cytokines is a prominent effect of microgravity on leukocytes during spaceflight [24].

Microgravity  also  impaired  monocyte  function:  During the spacelab-mission SLS-1 monocytes lost their capability of secreting IL-1 [25] and of expressing IL-2-receptor [26]. However, the molecular mechanisms are not identified. Examination of gene expression of monocytes under real  microgravity  demonstrated  significant  changes  in gene induction associated with differentiation of monocytes into macrophages [27]. Kaur et al . [28] investigated monocytes  isolated  from  astronauts  before  and  after  a mission  and  compared  the  results  with  control  groups.

They found a reduction of phagocytosis and a reduced oxidative burstand degranulation-capacity. Meloni et al . [29] recently demonstrated that simulated weightlessness leads to massive alterations in the cytoskeleton of monocytes,  which  in  turn  influences  motility  and  recently revealed during an ISS experiment a severe reduction in the locomotion ability of monocytic cells in microgravity [30]. Importantly, LFA-1 and ICAM-1 adhesion proteins expression  seemed  also  to  be  sensitive  to  microgravity, whereas their interaction is not altered [30]. It seems that not all cell types of the immune system are sensitive to reduced gravity: Extensive studies with natural killer cells in simulated weightlessness and in real microgravity on board of the ISS revealed that neither cytotoxic effects nor interferon  production  is  altered  in  microgravity  [31]. Major  gravi-sensitive  signal  transduction  elements  in mammalian cells are summarized in additional file 1 and figure 1.

## Cell migration in microgravity

Neutrophil granulocytes demonstrate the body's first line of host defense by recognizing and killing microorganisms.

Gravi-sensitive signal transduction elements in mammalian cells Figure 1 Gravi-sensitive signal transduction elements in mammalian cells . Gravi-sensitive signal transduction elements has been detected at the cell surface, such as VCAM-1 (Vascular cell adhesion molecule 1), ICAM-1 (Intercellular adhesion and molecule 1) and IL-2R (interleukin-2 receptor), in the cytoplasma such as PKC (protein kinase C) and MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinases) and in the nucleus such as expression of c-fos, c-jun and other genes. Microgravity severely affects also the cytoskeleton. However, the primary molecular mechanisms how microgravity influences cell signaling are unknown.

Neutrophil  locomotion  is  integral  for  immune  effector function, because the cells have to leave the blood vessels and navigate  to  places  of  infection  and  injury  to  fulfill their main task of phagocytosis. They are one of the most important cells regulating the immune response, because they  can  influence  both  induction  and  effector  stage  of immune reactions. Several studies provided evidence of a disturbed function of neutrophil granulocytes: Returning astronauts  of  spaceflight  missions  exhibited  a  strong increase  of  neutrophil  granulocytes  immediatedly  after landing [32,33], and neutrophil chemotactic assays showed a 10-fold decrease in the optimal dose-response after landing [34]. In a parabolic flight experiment neutrophil  granulocytes  showed  a  dramatic  increase  of  the superoxide-anion production [35]. Whereas some studies discuss  an  influence  of  space  flights  on  the  neutrophil phagocytotic  activity  and  oxidative  function  [32],  the influence of gravity on the migration of neutrophil granulocytes, which also determines the efficiency of an immunologial response, is still not known.

Cell migration is an essential characteristic of life. Multicellular organisms must be motile to obtain nourishment, evade being eaten in their own right, respond to environmental  changes  and  reproduce.  Likewise,  unicellular organisms such as Paramecium or Loxodes must dynamically respond to fluctuations in ever-changing surroundings to assure survival [6]. However, cell migration is also an essential characteristic of many normal and abnormal biological processes within the human organism including  embryonic development, defense against infections, wound healing and tumor metastasis [36,37]. In previous studies using simulated microgravity, changes in gravity demonstrated  an  inhibition  of  lymphocyte  locomotion through  type  I  collagen  [38,39],  and  culture  of  human bone marrow CD34+ cells using NASA 's rotating wall vessels resulted in a decreased migration potential [40]. An altered movement in real microgravity was shown for leukocytes and Jurkat T cells, too [41,42], whereas the underlying signal transduction mechanisms are still illusive. On the other side, T cells become more motile after being cultured in 10 g hypergravity [43].

The cytoskeleton is  responsible for giving a cell its shape and for generating the forces required for cell motility. It is an internal network of at least three types of cytosolic fibers: actin filaments, microtubules and intermediate filaments.  Actin,  one  of  the  most  highly  conserved  and abundant eukaryotic proteins, is constantly polymerized and depolymerized within cells to invoke cellular motility,  tissue formation and repair [44,45]. Actin dynamics are considered to be the major component of the cytoskeleton responsible for cell motility. It has been shown to be essential  for  the  migration  of  T  lymphocytes  as  well  as neutrophil  granulocyte  migration,  a  conclusion  readily

assumed  as  actin-depolymerizing  drugs  inhibit  cellular motility [46,47]. In contrast, an intact microtubule network does not appear to be required for neutrophil migration, because microtubule-disrupting drugs such as colchicine even induce the migration of neutrophils [48], probably by inducing changes in the actin network.

## Gravisensitivity of the cytoskeleton

Multiple  investigators  have  reported  that  this  complex network  of  fibers  is  sensitive  to  environmental  factors such as microgravity and altered gravitational forces [49]. Several  studies  demonstrate  modifications  of  the  actin and microtubule cytoskeleton in microgravity. Already a few minutes of simulated weightlessness provided by 2Dclinorotation  affected  the  cytoskeleton  of  lymphocytes, astrocytes, neurons and glial cells, disorganizing microtubules, intermediate filaments and microfilaments [50,51]. Morphological differences of both the microtubule and actin components of the cytoskeleton have been observed in cells grown in real and simulated microgravity [50,52]. Gruener and Hughes-Fulford reported that actin reorganization responded to the gravity level and showed abnormal assembly of actin stress fibers during spaceflight [5355]. In human mesenchymal stem cells F-actin stress fibers  were  disrupted  within  three  hours  of  initiation  of modeled  microgravity  [56].  On  the  contrary,  in  Jurkat cells microgravity did not change the structure of actin but from vimentin [42]. Other studies have shown that microtubules are gravity sensitive,  too  [57].  Microtubule  selfassembly is inhibited in the absence of gravity in space [58], and Lewis et al. observed that the microtubule filaments  extended  from  a  poorly  defined  centrosome  in human  Jurkat  cells  [52].  Moreover,  cancer  cells  grown under microgravity exhibited an increased and highly disorganized vimentin as well as altered microtubules [59,60].

Many  components  of signal transduction  pathways are known  to  regulate  the  cytoskeleton  [11,52,54].  With regard  to  migration,  neutrophils  are  the  fastest  moving cells at all with a speed maximum of 15 to 20 μ m/min [61], and the starting signal for their migration to sites of inflammation  is provided  by early proinflammatory cytokines such  as the bacterial peptide  N-Formyl-Lmethionyl-L-leucyl-L-phenylalanine (fMLP) [62]. The bacterial peptide fMLP is the major chemotactic peptide produced  by Escherichia  coli and  known  to  be  a  strong stimulator for the migration of neutrophil granulocytes. fMLP  binds  and  activates  a  class  of  G-protein-coupled receptors. Ligand binding leads to the activation of two signalling pathways: (i) the activation of the PLC-gamma generates  inositol-1,4,5-phosphate  (IP )  and  diacylglyc3 erol (DAG), which results in IP 3 mediated release of intracellularly stored calcium in the endoplasmatic reticulum and  DAG-mediated  activation  of  the  protein  kinase  C

(PKC). These are key events for the regulation of locomotory  activity  [62-64].(ii)  the  activation  of  the  adenylyl cyclase  leads  to  an  increase  of  cytosolic  cAMP,  which results  in  an  activation  of  the  sarcoplasmatic/endoplasmatic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA) pump and calcium sequestration. Thus, stimulation of neutrophils with fMLP activates a signal transduction pathway ultimately leading  to  an  elevation  of  cytosolic  calcium  which  has been shown to be essential for the development of actinbased migration [65]. In addition, observations of migrating neutrophils within  a three-dimensional  collagen matrix  revealed  a  frequent  increase  of  calcium  in  those parts of the cells that underwent shape changes a few seconds  later,  and  visualization  of  the  calcium  signal  was shown to be a directionality marker for the orientation of neutrophils  locomoting  in  a  three-dimensional  space [62]. With regard to cell migration, the inhibition of lymphocyte locomotion observed under microgravity culture conditions  could  be  reversed  by  prior  activation  with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), which directly activates the PKC [39].

Migration of immune cells is a crucial process during a multitude of physiological and pathophysiological conditions such as development, defense against infections and wound  healing  [36,37].  Leukocytes  move  through  the body in order to keep the organism under immunological surveillance and  to  respond  to  pathogenic  invading microorganisms. Migration within the body tissues and through  endothelial  barriers  is  strongly  dependent  and regulated  both  by  cytoskeletal  processes  and  by  expression of surface adhesion molecules such as selectins and integrins  [66],  which  interact  with  components  of  the extracellular  matrices.  Whereas  the  influence  of  microgravity on the cytoskeleton is well investigated [49], there is only little known about adhesion molecule expression in altered gravity. Importantly,  the  phenomenon  of altered cytoskeletal organisation and migration in microgravity has been described well in non-adherent cells so far,  but  there  is  only  little  knowledge  of  cytoskeletal organisation in adherent cells, such as endothelial cells. Experiments on board of the Space Shuttle Mission STS57  revealed  a  decrease  of  selectin-expression,  but  no change in ICAM-1 expression in splenocytes [10]. Moreover, long-term gravity vector changes modulate expression of ICAM-1, E-selectin and VCAM-1 on cultured endothelial cells, and increased adhesion of PMA-activated lymphocytes on endothelial monolayers in simulated and in real  microgravity  [67].  An  experiment,  which  addressed the  focal  adhesion  in  connective  tissue  in  microgravity, has been performed on board of STS-107 Spacelab [68], but got lost due to the fatal accident of the Space Shuttle Columbia  in  2003.  Thus,  clear  results  about  adhesion molecule expression after onset of altered gravity are still missing.

It is possible that the molecular and cellular structure of life  on  Earth  may  require  gravity  for  survival,  either  in individual  or  in  evolutionary  terms,  and  it  is  therefore possible  that  exactly  such  gravity-dependent  or  gravitysensing  mechanisms  will  keep  us  dependent  from  the gravity field of Earth. No one can really neglect the importance of gravity on biological systems and only the facts that research platforms are rare and that access to altered gravity is limited, reduce the speed of progress in gravity research compared to other disciplines.

Technically, we are able to travel to Earth orbit or Moon for weeks up to months, and most probably, in the next decades we will be able to fly to Mars. But until now there is only limited knowledge about the biological and biomedical  effects of weightlessness on  organisms  and humans, especially on the cellular  and  molecular level, where  therapeutic  or  preventive  countermeasures  could be developed.
